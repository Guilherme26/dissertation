oh my goodness it's going to update youtube this is sel 0320 representing JVS i'm,0.07759964
back here for a brand new movie review the name of this movie is spotlight,0.08352198
i am going to be doing two different reviews of this or overviews i should,0.053568885
say there's going to be one concrete review is going to be completely non-spoiler i'm,0.051925983
not gonna reveal anything about the plot unless you want I should know about the,0.068163455
real based on true life events this movie is based on but the second one,0.08509372
is going to be from a different perspective that's all I can say I'll say,0.051121034
that towards the end the name of the movie is called spotlight it stars Mark,0.065037265
Ruffalo Michael Keaton Rachel McAdams leave us Mulder um shoot even got John Slater in,0.24158178
this movie but this is the status of the movie a true story of how,0.06135031
Boston Globe uncovered a massive scandal um of child molestation and the cover-up of the,0.53737736
specific Catholic Church and that's all I'm kind of gonna read but it's so much,0.10267233
more than that normally I don't read snaps it to come on IMDb because they,0.13128415
revealed way too much about the stories um you know transparent plot but this movie,0.063281514
I'm go ahead and talk about just like I normally would any other review i'll,0.063339025
go on the dynamics of the visual immersion the soundtrack the acting as well as,0.06970842
the story but the story i'm way I'm winner revealed I'm not going to say,0.06833018
anything about it i'm just going to talk about plot points so visual effects of,0.06895588
this like the cinematography um it was excellently shot they didn't use a lot of,0.12966964
trickery as far as like me haven't seen anything quite like this it was with,0.08242092
me he was really normally shot but it was like for every single moment or,0.24070482
significant thing that was happening i think the most impactful things when did characters such,0.059871424
as Rachel McAdams or Mark Ruffalo are interviewing specific people that supposedly were going through,0.09813741
the less station situations when you see it and actually here it is so eloquently,0.068730876
done because it focuses on the performance and they give how do I put it,0.052908324
they give so much more credit to the non big-name quote-unquote actors to be able,0.08192791
to tell this story it's almost as though the non actress they feel real they,0.07652598
feel really authentic the way that the cinematography is taken and checking from their perspective,0.055394046
every small scene where you see somebody that is a victim of this situation that,0.15265578
happened or it's been happening over at certain X amount of years because the movie,0.06887527
starts off in the very beginning i think it was around like 1976 or something,0.1011086
like that where something had just happened I ministation I guess case it just opened,0.107635505
up and it seemed really shady and really shoddy and then from that point the,0.24160731
score goes and the score y'all like it's done so well it's the undercurrent of,0.08475276
it because it's really smoothly paste I don't know who did the score for it,0.066568635
but it did an amazing job with it I actually really enjoyed because I think,0.07218426
it it helps with the weight of it when there's moments of silence there are,0.07155461
moments of silent when there's moments key moments when things are just kind of pacing,0.07048802
along where they're kind of going and trying to uncover this case or just part,0.07879962
of the situation this is paced really well as up-tempo via the same that time,0.07926929
it's not too flashy it's just right and it's all aspired to cinematography as far,0.069124386
as the score is concerned I mean the cinematography was nothing I haven't seen before,0.0723196
but for the key moments that are significant they are done and executed well and,0.15077218
they allow the actors to be as ok that's just their skills but their dedication,0.10228437
to the roles and the craft for what the whole plot about this movie is,0.06204078
we're talking into pretty soon I mean there was a point where Mark Ruffalo's character,0.088404536
is kind of arguing with um Michael Keaton's character and like it's so deep it's,0.057379518
so impact because the weight of everything has already hit you as a viewer but,0.31089434
when it focuses on like everything he's kind of already gone through to the point,0.07460072
of like him arguing I able to lose the perfect kind of scene and it,0.14153059
added really good tension but one of the things I was saying this is going,0.076676875
to segue into the acting of this the the actors that to me are stealing,0.2634556
the show are the victims like I said like there are moments where I'm sitting,0.086558044
there listening to these cases and they are very explicit I see why this movie,0.087639235
I think it's written arm or listen should be because they go into some heavy,0.4195056
deep stuff this movie is about two hours and eight minutes long but it's not,0.07388389
too long because you want to see the completion of the store when I was,0.0815556
looking at black master moments why I was kind of feel like man this is,0.31089434
too much too over-the-top at times but I mean it might be the true story,0.050421517
you know but this story as a weight like when you hear in like the,0.09107808
actors talk about their molestation situation or they're after effects are the remnants of their,0.37037966
life or even people that have covered up stuff like you see it all over,0.11222464
the faces in their performance and they do an amazing job but the thing that,0.041345388
I have to say as well is that my ruffalo michael keaton a trick adams,0.095850624
when they're doing the interviews they do a good job of trying to cover up,0.07411454
what their internally hearing they only towards the mid and the after acts show how,0.04086866
that how they've been uncovering all this information processing everything that has happened has affected,0.06446042
them because when they're doing the interview stuff like that there are really professional they're,0.074699044
listening and doing this they're attentive but it's like everything that happened really had an,0.06191456
effect on them not just from their mental state or emotional state from their spiritual,0.31699637
perspective what they believe like is really intriguing to see like man it felt like,0.09407752
this was real and I mean everybody plays their road to a tee I dare,0.108813405
moments while I'm thinking man somebody's lying like somebody's covered this part up I think,0.37219128
that specifically market keeps character like in the beginning like I'm like okay he you,0.06688709
know he's doing all he can to you know do this right but who actually,0.08214501
in my opinion actually really still just always leave us motor because this character um,0.09229128
Marty Baron is like I guess this new New York Times best then listen came,0.083491094
from Florida and did that and now he's coming in the first case he wants,0.08735162
to do is open up about why this has not been investigated and like he,0.10756787
is so funny because his character is like so monotone and so off-putting like he,0.22409165
doesn't play golf he doesn't really get along with other people he's not there for,0.052482195
the prestige like he's there for a mission but it's like the way that he,0.077231504
talks and articulates his words he is the chain like he is literally the chain,0.100321434
that's driving this and is holding on to these characters and he works with them,0.06366668
so well as a team because he's pushing them but at the same time he's,0.12654147
going through it with them you see he'll put just as much work in as,0.0693967
each and every single one of them through the the process of them trying to,0.07308427
figure out what has really happened and I've gone to that into the segue into,0.114490405
the plot but I have to give him honorable mention because if he didn't play,0.057078224
the role like he did and wouldn't have add as much weight because I was,0.089116156
kind of like he's really off quitting like I'm sneaking that Michael Keaton was going,0.21151043
to be that that character but he was you know even though my kids character,0.06637756
significant his was even more so and he did an amazing job with he did,0.06088808
an amazing job even like job slavery playing the role of uh Ben I liked,0.3006195
his character because I couldn't figure him out I was like I don't know this,0.1521908
guy like who's somebody is lying you know and I was kind of feeling that,0.23303065
that's good storytelling that's good right in scripting storytelling so going into the plot I'm,0.0539416
not going to reveal to y'all what happens if you want to read into it,0.08251972
look up the story is on IMDb it'll go and give you to a web,0.115308106
link maybe Wikipedia or something like that but it's some heavy stuff because it's the,0.12507431
process that the Catholic Church has supposedly covered up your numerous amounts of child molestation,0.6748592
cases and that they're trying to unravel in figure them out and figuring out how,0.075283855
big a scope it is you know and I mean everybody's kind of coming with,0.14702705
repel if you look at the movie doubt for instance was that Meryl Streep and,0.08160017
philip seymour hoffman that was an amazing movie i was really dwell done it was,0.15190482
really sharp but it was all putting because you didn't know these are proven documented,0.07201212
facts that are just putting your face and like you're going through and you're like,0.43996507
man that's heavy I I don't know if I want to hear this you know,0.25873882
if it is it you don't have a choice you have to sit there and,0.087272406
take it and to take it into the fact that this is only in 2001,0.09459957
so how much more situation that happened in 2015 I remember when the case came,0.042589176
up using years ago and like to hear it it was like I was reliving,0.07118028
it you know and I mean I guess I guess that's the point of the,0.061206616
movie like it's a situation that is true that it has happened and the effect,0.056200616
of it I think is even more much weightier than the fact of that this,0.07915947
did happen because I'm looking at the effects this happened on these these actors of,0.2468044
these characters and it's like it's sad it is so seriously sad man like I,0.29175088
was in there like i'ma believe you're not believing God you know and I asked,0.18972237
that's basically what this other video I'm going to do I'm going to do a,0.07877826
full spiritual perspective on the weight of how this movie made me feel um and,0.076692
I'm gonna add that to my second channel i'll leave that in description bar below,0.079772644
so y'all can be able to go to that y'all want to hear my perspective,0.07664969
on that being I am a Christian um it's going to be interesting to say,0.14837079
that it's gonna be really hard for me I should go through that but as,0.08643419
a movie reviewer as a story it was on point hit on every single target,0.115350984
like I said there wasn't anything big as far as seven targets if I can't,0.10438351
say that it revolutionizes anything but it was shot perfectly it was scored perfectly they,0.119680054
had a great cast the sub characters the sub caste which I don't even want,0.10887395
to go through a name they all did an amazing night they were all believable,0.056300096
you know and even towards the very end it was just like wow like you,0.19331054
you will you will feel that weight of this movie in I highly recommend you,0.30002195
go and check this out as soon as the hist animals this weekend I was,0.11782528
blessed to be able to get an early screening of it and I should I'm,0.06934498
probably gonna try to see it again it was really well done I'm botched come,0.15141906
down blu-ray um but yeah again this is not for kids this is it are,0.09753568
it's a lot to it but hopefully you enjoyed my full review for the movie,0.088994905
spotlight and yeah I might head to this other thing this is going to be,0.15607621
even more harder to do French for me off either way keep a lot SEL,0.13022192
