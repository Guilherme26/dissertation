hello everybody welcome back to another movie reaction today we got another special one now,0.06813161
this has been on the patreon poll for quite some time and it's always just,0.05028834
barely missing it to being watched on the top two now this film is ladybird,0.1484821
now this is something that i'm i'm really i'm really just like looking forward to,0.0558623
because i've heard a lot of great things about it uh just in the regards,0.066527046
of just the the story itself and the writing and i i'm just like excited,0.06251746
as well as it being directed written and i'm trying to think of the other,0.097708
credit but it's produced by a probably like a woman as well too and you,0.16100982
guys know how i feel about just people being misrepresented or just underrepresented in film,0.13278052
uh in the film medium and i strive my best to shine a light on,0.02601686
to those who are just not as highlighted usually in the film industry which is,0.047953732
you know women and people of color and just other variations as well too just,0.3687644
to list a few examples so it's really great when you have bodies of work,0.13128616
whether good or bad just being made by people within that realm because it gives,0.18599929
forth a whole new perspective an opportunity of storytelling and just different perspectives which i,0.036295783
think is the key reasoning to making a film especially presenting it to an audience,0.07728155
so i'm really excited to kind of look at this not only through fresh eyes,0.14872146
me first first time watching this but also looking at it from a filmmaking perspective,0.08413562
and also really acknowledging and you know getting an insight of why this film is,0.08274702
great and what makes this film great and kind of like what i take out,0.114928804
of this film and you know hopefully learn something new myself uh so i'm really,0.11465477
excited about just the opportunity to learn and to educate and potentially help educate you,0.121270075
guys as well too i'm really excited about that so guys like always if you,0.107426174
want to see the full length because i do chop these up and a good,0.44233438
bit is you know unfortunately taking out of the youtube edit definitely check out the,0.25844705
full length below doing the you know through the patreon link if that's something that,0.10421499
you're interested in but like always guys i'm going to stop talking let's get right,0.35937408
into lady bird hey let's just sit with what we heard dang that dynamic shift,0.3736814
is wow oh so now you're mad no it's because i'm ridiculous because you have,0.7093121
a great moment i'm sorry i'm not perfect no one's asking you to be perfect,0.1115021
just consider it would do i don't even want to go to school i love,0.12724046
this already because i immediately noticed the dynamic shift barely be able to afford in-state,0.094851375
tuition mother daughter mother-son relationship can kind of be like that you guys can be,0.24177104
so emotionally attached and then be yelling at each other it all comes from a,0.15277645
good place though my name is ladybird uh well actually it's not and it's ridiculous,0.5876557
call me ladybird like you said you you should just go to city college you,0.53490317
know with your work ethic just wow i love how the conversation like their dialogue,0.07752344
is almost like overlapping one another i was i was not expecting that wow i,0.10354255
don't think i've ever done that afraid that we will not get into the college,0.08861657
of our choice we're afraid we won't be loved we won't be liked we won't,0.07480841
succeed there are the classics i'm really interested in seeing how this film tackles the,0.076971404
cliches of you know the life growing into the life sort of stories that we're,0.13620359
kind of used to i mean like you know amazed and confused being an example,0.09970204
of one i'm really interested in seeing how this film tells that story differently especially,0.04572223
being in a different time era having a different protagonist with a different mindset different,0.0488673
life it leaves for a lot of creativity in those areas do you know if,0.118457995
sarah lawrence is actually in the city your parents would pay for that scholarships financial,0.15287022
aid i'll figure it out my mom thinks i can't get in but she is,0.17930432
sorely mistaken she already got a little bit about like her dream of going to,0.13964894
like new york and you know i guess you could say places of like civilization,0.10412622
i guess you could say where people feel as though their dreams are i guess,0.09629352
they can't have pencils anymore there and they feel like they have to leave when,0.081039995
in reality i mean it might have always been there i don't know i can,0.09246073
relate to that because you know my experiences with even going to california myself maybe,0.03516602
that could be saved for a video in itself a q a you guys let,0.066310704
me know send them a note do you think that shelley and miguel have sex,0.710725
on the pullout couch oh yeah oh man that's great make your own nlgger eggs,0.6364068
i wanted to you don't let me your sister doesn't like me i'm hungry that,0.6364068
was great that entire scene was great for so many reasons i absolutely love that,0.1135414
i believe it you guys know how much i love dinner scenes or just anything,0.17281197
at the table there's so much personality that can be brought towards that and they,0.049394146
did a phenomenal job just with that is that your given name yeah why is,0.07558817
it in quote well i gave it to myself it's given to me by me,0.091546245
okay i love the energy that is some great energy right there this is awesome,0.05263702

hi come here often excuse me i'm ladybug yo this is great i love the,0.41058645
interactions here because i yeah i get our emotions going we're going to play i,0.14967714
absolutely love how this film looks by the way it doesn't feel like a nostalgia,0.122865565
because i don't think this was filmed in in film you know if i could,0.090693034
use a correlation like dazed and confused feels nostalgic because it's film you know like,0.088571176
it has that natural grain i think this feels like an emotion this feels like,0.08516923
a dream because it's shot digitally but the greens and the blue hues of the,0.102920674
shadows really give forth these incredible emotions it feels like a moment find the problems,0.101841986
where you went wrong and work them out good job jules i could tell from,0.12684737
your work you even understood the ones you missed yikes yikes you know when a,0.15925035
teacher gives you a test face down that's never a good sign oh boy oh,0.270799
boy i still don't know how to use those rollers that you gave me oh,0.34033084
oh man oh man the awkwardness is is so authentic ah there you go yo,0.10851698
oh man i i oh this is great again like that's why i don't feel,0.15014571
nostalgic over it it feels like a memory because i mean shoot i felt that,0.4085214
way when i had my first kiss some of your friends fathers could employ your,0.18524563
father and they're not going to do it if it looks like his family is,0.11398055
trash wow wow dang it's so interesting how this story almost feels like it's being,0.53490317
told by two different perspectives you know like you get little inputs of her story,0.07560393
and then almost like the reality of the family specifically the mothers they pick up,0.08419738
your feet i didn't know if you were talking about being passive aggressive you are,0.4136243
so infuriated i'm not yelling oh it's perfect i love it oh man i love,0.14446607
the writing in this i mean it really does showcase the duality of it like,0.061496627
especially the mother and daughter relationship you know like again it's just all out of,0.11781893
love even if it's weird in the duffel bag don't worry about it geez my,0.19516924
grandmother will love that dress i think i think what i'm noticing too about the,0.1302696
mother hence why she's so strict this is because yeah oh my god it's because,0.19359162
she's me letting her daughter go you know like she's slowly coming to terms with,0.34152463
that and i think that's her own way of coping with it i just hope,0.11902065
it doesn't self-destruct her daughter you know and we have to kill his older brothers,0.8355208
too oh boy oh boy that's oh no it's him it's the man it's dune,0.21653003
guy let me stop playing there's never a line in the men's room oh oh,0.17811605
okay all right all right wow i was not i was not expecting that now,0.08680424
i'm pretty sure dune guy now is going to be uh an open option do,0.22607547
you need money for the applications i can help with that no no i've got,0.097622074
that summer jobs covered it this is why we have computer shut-off time this is,0.1380591
our room okay okay just can you drive me to the post office nj it,0.0704932

too he is too cool man i was never that cool i mean i kept,0.14969945
to myself when i was younger but like i don't know i looked like something,0.094555676
else i think i think i think the universe above for this glow up now,0.07469023
cause oh man all right let's have everyone take a knee huh what cozy sit,0.23081887
now i know you all miss father devayed i can tell you that the brothers,0.11245619
oh my goodness is the coach the the director of the play is that why,0.039083045

a number to each of your roles and i'm gonna put the blocking up here,0.352461
on the board and then if you guys can transcribe that back into your playbooks,0.17120387
that'd be great oh this is great that's a beautiful flip on like the cliche,0.19251712
of the gym coach always teaching jim oh this is great this is comedy i,0.063013844

a little bit of time to figure out how i'm going to tell my mom,0.1360991
and dad don't worry hmm wow wow that's wow i'm wow that's really that's that,0.10158383
was really well done man wow i absolutely love that that was really well done,0.09263031

produced is he sasuke guy now oh my goodness [Laughter] you live in sacramento i,0.2595741
love it here i want to send my daughters to immaculate heart i also love,0.26851815
that like the people that she's meeting like they're not like cliche evil you know,0.3688822
like in other movies this girl right here would be like completely evil you know,0.53490317
i think she's just like plus three times like it feels like it's just another,0.17329182
friendship that was kind of made and whether if it's good or bad it is,0.09041
but she isn't inherently evil yeah well you know your mom's tits they're fake totally,0.9156528
fake she made one bad decision at 19. two bad decisions and at 15 wow,0.31089434
she actually made an interesting point about just like lady bird always kind of like,0.10562773
wanting attention as well too cause low-key she always does want attention me a number,0.23774469
for how much it costs to raise me and i'm gonna get older and make,0.08730424
a lot of money and write you a check for what i owe you so,0.12674078
that i never have to speak to you again wow oh wow jeez man that,0.33957794
was that was rough i'm just happy i didn't lose my virginity to you yeah,0.76846164
i was about to say i was about to say i don't yeah he never,0.12746927
he never said that i was on top who the nlgger is on top their,0.28666735
first time you mean like awareness of how many civilians we've killed since the invasion,0.31089434
in iraq started what's this sweater oh man that moment is just uh man shout,0.3011013
out to the moms out there my goodness what a what a role again i,0.07389757
gotta shout out how much i love the compositioning of this camera and most importantly,0.12948242
the color grading of this film i think it's it's it's perfect for this i,0.10428846
i absolutely love it i feel like it's the perfect color grade for this film,0.1501596
because of just how it's capturing the moments in our life sure i guess i,0.0608676
pay attention don't you think maybe they are the same thing love and attention yes,0.091090955
and that's what i was talking about like that's what i was feeling like what,0.08912403
was like almost like the theme of this movie is like this is our last,0.06679812
one when people you know pay attention to her when she pays attention to things,0.10140214
it's like it's like love and i think that's why the mother and daughter relationship,0.15277663
is just so like that is like the perfection of love because it's not perfect,0.08156347
but there's a tension involved and i think that creates perseverance you know like love,0.06165392
isn't like perfect or anything but it perseveres too tight and i and i think,0.11371102
that's the theme of the mother and daughter's relationship i'm so happy she said that,0.15820494
i think she's weird she is weird hey guys i guess i'll just sit shotgun,0.61171085
man really did just like wait in the car though that's that's uh come on,0.13369304
now that's too sasuke for me nlgger hate this song i love it thank you,0.5932302
thank you please it's so interesting because other than like there'd be moments where she,0.104900695
would stick by herself and then she would not can you take me to my,0.23967452
friend julie's house please and i'm just so happy she's embracing it now um oh,0.13108437
man this this is great this is a really damn good film this is a,0.46979326
really damn good film i feel like with dazed and confused it captured an era,0.40312952
this film captures a moment and freeze all faults as you from crimes would pardon,0.27638355
to be let your indulgence set me free you yo that is the man i,0.23008794
uh i love his character it's so good man it is so good sorry i,0.09816213
know i can lie and not be a good person but please mom please i'm,0.5239099
so sorry i didn't mean to i'm noticing how she's not giving her any attention,0.14860548
all those memories man it really does feel like i've i've just entered her life,0.20288621
it's so good and it's just so beautifully executed man seriously the power of film,0.30447066
making well done dang you gotta learn how to let go like i said it's,0.35119075
so self-destructive if you become like that i can't imagine how rough it must be,0.38762057
but like you gotta be able to see your daughter off to college at least,0.42805934
you know like come on turn around turn around turn around you're almost there come,0.20853263
on it's okay should be back man geez i'm happy she came back though i,0.27529097
really am that was a well done shot hey mom did you feel emotional the,0.49557748
first time that you drove in sacramento um oh man i'm getting chills i'm getting,0.19354293
a whole lot of chills right here right in the heart yep you you start,0.07466101
really paying attention to things when you leave it and then when you come back,0.07596984
and the whole theme of paying attention and loving and how those relate with one,0.026194353
another i love you it's beautifully told and that is ladybird wow that was a,0.08944027
phenomenal film guys all right everybody and we just got done watching ladybird man oh,0.22444789
man this film was just yeah this is a great one this is this is,0.0959006
definitely a good one this was it's so interesting watching all of these films that,0.15627807
pertain to you know nostalgia and you know referring back to an era or a,0.055439882
dream a moment and just watching how the stories that are being told are showcased,0.03972718
through the filmmaking and man like lady bird did just a phenomenal job telling a,0.10827112
story about a moment and a girl's life and just her womanhood as she grew,0.34872705
more into herself and it did it in such a way that wasn't it took,0.06997865
all the cliches and it it it it almost authenticated it i don't even know,0.2717716
if that's even a word but that's what i'm feeling it feels like they just,0.08254019
basically got all these cliches and they were like this is how we make them,0.35376284
real to this person so they can be relatable to you know to those who,0.18467844
experience this and i feel like this is one of those films where you know,0.1425403
it could easily be a hit or miss because of just how personal it can,0.1499367
be and i mean that with all praise because it definitely hit with me because,0.102268904
i know even though i am a guy i feel as though the experiences that,0.09281716
she went through with christine lady bird went through um you know the themes of,0.14950375
it are very real to my childhood and my evolution as who i am now,0.09871067
and what i'm probably going to be in the future and i can relate very,0.04416201
heavily to those themes because the theme is love the theme is growth and you,0.09042623
know growing through these uncertainties and realizing that not everything is as pictured perfect and,0.10078257
as hollywood as the stories would like you to think that they are but in,0.08043586
fact they are more textured and more unknown and i love that ladybird explored those,0.19295782
those moments and i i'm just so happy that it was you know created by,0.122278154
a woman you know like this by all the terms was yeah it's it's just,0.17367531
it's just great because i love seeing stories of different types and it just makes,0.030665062
me happy seeing more opportunities in film that are told by people who usually don't,0.078382805
get that opportunity and i think this is just one of the many reasons that,0.075011544
are out there in terms of why it is important no matter where you are,0.10331787
or whatever you're going through to tell your story no matter what the case may,0.14910348
be you know it's it's a beautiful thing and you could really be helping other,0.09066613
people doing it so i just want to say thank you to the director and,0.074150324
to all the people who laid hands on this film and for those patreon people,0.31089434
who recommended me this um this was this was a really good film i really,0.11041112
