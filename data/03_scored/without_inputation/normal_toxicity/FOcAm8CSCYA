greetings fellow Gor house and welcome back to another blood-splattered vlog,0.5272494
so I just got back from Wonder Woman the latest entry in the DC Cinematic Universe I guess it's called anyway,0.10601746
this is a movie that I've been anticipating with a lot of hesitation,0.11271481
and by that I mean I've been very weary about this film and the reason why I've been so weary is because on one hand I hated Batman V Superman and Man of Steel,0.16306703
and this movie's supposed to be a continuation of the universe that those two films started but on the other hand Suicide Squad was pretty fun,0.15440926
despite being a complete and utter mess from start to finish,0.3961043
and on top of that the trailers for this movie made this movie look great,0.084741466
especially the latest trailer that was released a few weeks ago that one was phenomenal but even so I've been burned before there have been many movies where the trailer was fantastic,0.16175272
and I ended up extremely disappointed in the theater,0.13679646
in fact I would put Man of Steel right on that list,0.07742064
but now I have finally seen Wonder Woman and now that I have I can say without any hesitation that Wonder Woman is wonderful,0.08945787
this is the kind of movie I've been wanting DC to produce ever since they started this idea of a DC Cinematic Universe they brought to life one of their most iconic characters in an extremely faithful way while still doing a little bit of their own thing but not in any way that takes away from the original core of the character,0.061944425
this is still Wonder Woman,0.1719261
she's still fighting for truth,0.111075915
she's still fighting for justice,0.15473053
she's still fighting for love,0.15396194
in fact the core theme of this movie could really be summed up with love not war,0.08616474
this is one of the best superhero movies ever made,0.072644144
I put this up there with some of my favorites like spider-man 2 and The Avengers 2 movies that got to the core of their characters and brought them to life in a way that I never thought was possible,0.07388414
and this movie did that with Wonder Woman and oh my god I was cheering in the theater multiple times,0.13339348
and one of the things I really like is that the director of this movie took the visuals that Dec Snyder was doing with the Batman V Superman movies and added more color to it so that it wasn't completely like dire and dark the whole time this movie saved it's d saturated scenes for scenes where it's appropriate like the war scenes,0.066772096
but for the scenes were Wonder Woman is saving the day,0.07485851
that's when her colors are shining brightly on the screen and it's beautiful,0.11402908
in fact every frame of this movie is gorgeous and the writing matches that beauty,0.07543956
and so does the acting,0.07453208
and so does the score,0.054497827
everything about this movie is perfect,0.14093043
they even have one the best fight scenes I've seen in a superhero movie since the fight scene between spider-man,0.13760932
and Doc Ock on the train which for me that fight scene is the crown jewel of all superhero fight scene,0.117041364
so the fact that this would be managed to match,0.06490788
that is amazing,0.05153122
may I take that back,0.068281986
it's not amazing it's wonderful,0.10743212
and that's another thing this movie has action in spectacle,0.12276874
that's almost on par with what's in Man,0.101216406
of Steel except in this case you actually care,0.13358265
because this movie makes you not only feel for Wonder Woman herself but also the side characters around her and all the random people she's saving I couldn't give two shits about anyone in Manas feel especially Superman,0.692417
but here there were points where I was so excited that I can feel my heart beating out of my chest out of just pure adrenaline and the cherry on top of this utterly delicious cake is at the end of the movie they included the shot that I've been waiting for since they said they were going to do a Wonder Woman movie,0.15387608
and that is of course the iconic shot of her lifting up a tank with her bare hands and the moment that happened in this movie I stood up in the theater and cheered as loud as I could and I wasn't alone a lot of the other people in the theater with me also cheered,0.15938275
so yeah my fellow gore hounds,0.31089434
I know it's not a horror movie I know,0.099060245
it's not bloody,0.37581646
I know it's pg-13 but a good movie is a good movie,0.07019108
and Wonder Woman is a great movie so go check it out in theaters,0.16303909
and if you would like to listen to the Wonder Woman soundtrack I will include an Amazon affiliate link in the description below and if you click that link and buy the soundtrack from that link then I will get a kickback from it,0.099231794
and with all that said my fellow gore hounds let us move on to this spoilers alrighty then so this movie is bookended by a prologue and an epilogue of Wonder Woman in the modern day and she receives this package from Bruce Wayne that includes a picture of her from World War 1 and upon seeing this picture and her standing with her old team from back then she starts reminiscing about her origins,0.13052179
so we flash all the way back to when she was a little girl living on some mascara the amazon island and she's just an adorable rebellious little who desperately wants to learn how to fight,0.24974567
but her mom who also happens to be the queen does not want her to but her mom's sister disagrees because she believes there's going to become a day where diana is going to have to learn to defend herself and luckily for diana her happens to be the greatest warrior the Amazons have ever seen,0.24605036
so her aunt starts training her in secret much to the chagrin of her mother we flash forward a few years to win Diana as a teenager and her mom finds out and gets really mad at her sister but her sister insists one more time that diana is absolutely going to need to defend herself one day,0.18815906
so she needs to train her and this time her mom realizes that there's no way she's going to stop this,0.18948862
so she reluctantly agrees and this is when the real training begins we then flash forward once again to Diana as an adult after a shit-ton of intense training,0.7312467
in fact they even say that they trained her harder than any other Amazon before her including her aunt who like I said is supposed to be the greatest warrior the Amazons I've ever seen so far but now that she's an adult she must prove herself to her mom by defeating her aunt,0.17863832
but she lets her guard down because it's her aunt which causes her aunt could flip out on her and just start hitting her with some really harsh tough love but when Diana blocks with her bracelets,0.53490317
they have like a Dragonball Z style like energy,0.07174351
burst burst out of her which causes her aunt to get knocked on her ass and the rest of the Amazons around her to look at her in fear she then runs off understandably emotionally distressed at what just happened and she happens to run over to this cliff just as this by plane this World War 1 by plane breaks through the barrier that surrounds the island and just crashes into the bay,0.74503154
and she runs out to save the pilot,0.0820127
and of course the pilot turned out to be Trevor's who in the comics was the man who essentially triggered Wonder Woman to leave the island which is essentially what happens here she saved Trevor's just as the Germans break through the barrier to get to him,0.1647359
there's this gorgeous and super intense action sequence on the beach as the Germans and the Amazons collide and of course with the help of Trevor's the Amazons end up winning but not before Diana's aunt takes a bullet for her and she dies in a legitimately moving scene,0.11339481
you actually care about this end,0.138117
even though she's only been in the movie for about 15 minutes,0.09664658
which just tells you how great the storytelling is in this movie that you care,0.13959694
so much about this character with so little screen time just god damn it's so good,0.75842774
so anyway the Amazons use the lasso of truth on Trevor's which gets him to admit that,0.0705648
he was a spy for the British government and that he had infiltrated this one German base and discovered this super secret bio weapon that they had planned on using on the western front a weapon,0.24065924
so chemically corrosive that it literally dissolves gas masks so there ain't no escaping it you're gonna die if it's unleashed and of course Diana upon warning about world war one believes it's her sacred duty to go out there and stop this war because according to the story her mom read to her at the beginning of the movie when she was a little girl most it's not all wars are a result of Ares the God of War,0.31153366
and the Amazons are the sworn enemy of Ares in fact their island was built to protect this,0.15050793
one sword called the god killer,0.43337002
which was apparently created by Zeus for the sole purpose of killing Ares because apparently a long time ago Ares much like Lucifer declared war on the heavens,0.43286932
and he ended up killing all the other gods in the process with the single exception of Zeus though you never actually see him in this movie,0.5154597
so Diana decides she's going to go to the world of man and she's gonna find Ares and stop this war her mom really doesn't want her to do it,0.55225724
but diana is not one to listen to anyone but herself and i love her for it she is a stubborn badass,0.604642
so she takes the lasso of truth,0.08146264
she takes the Wonder Woman outfit and she takes the god killer sword and they take off on a boat to London,0.40324175
so I'm not exactly sure where sem m√°scara is supposed to be because they arrive at London really fast which I suppose I could complain about that but I love the movie so much as that minor weird thing didn't really bug me at all,0.15862785
so when they get to London they decide they need to get new clothes because he's still dressed like a German pilot,0.2833849
and she looks like warrior princess and they need some sort of normal street clothes so that they can blend in with the rest of the city,0.11572954
so they have this really funny scene where Trevor's his secretary is getting her to try on all these outfits but she's like breaking them and ripping them because they don't quite work with her movements and yeah we've kind of seen seems like this before the entirety of Encino man is basically this scene in a nutshell but it's funny and I really enjoyed it hell did I just bring up Encino man in a Wonder Woman review what's wrong with me,0.35367635
so anyway they meet up with Trevor's commander and he refuses to actually go through with stopping this chemical weapon because apparently they're really close to peace and they don't want to ruin that good faith by sending troops into German territory which pisses off Diana,0.31521133
and I love the scene where she screams at all those generals in that room it is great,0.3662094
so Trevor's decides that they're going to go into German territory themselves,0.10802696
but first they need a team,0.06195508
and this right here is the part of the movie that feels the most like Captain America the First Avenger because Trevor's introduces her to this group of misfits that essentially kind of feel like the Howling Commandos Captain America but before they leave one of the aristocrats who was in that meeting with all the generals and was preaching for peace,0.29324
he shows up and pledges his secret support to trevor's and a team and then off they go to the Western Front where we get one of the greatest superhero moments in superhero movie history where Wonder Woman learns about no man's land seize all the victims of no man's land and decides to end,0.119625546
no man's land,0.15096112
she climbs out of the trench and stands tall as all,0.1713406
the Germans are shooting at her and she's deflecting the bullets with her armed guards and it's just awesome,0.6128848
this is like aw man,0.13217494
this is what superhero movies are all about and goddamn it I'm going to stop the point by point synopsis here because this movie is just too good to spoil one thing,0.7088204
I will say though is that Ares is actually in this movie and he has an amazing fight scene with Wonder Woman,0.26593435
and he is a character that I kind of figured was going to end up being Ares from the get-go because when Diana's mom tells her about Ares as a detail she gives about Ares and there's only one character over the course of the movie who matches that detail,0.12903102
so it was really obvious to me who Ares was over the course of the movie but to some other people it might be more surprising anyway just goddamn,0.77530855
