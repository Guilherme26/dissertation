so we've had enough time to soak in the movie black panther came out I,0.15171641
believe February 16th of this month did I really just say I said February 16th,0.013697461
of this month it came out this month and I just saw it for the,0.029632602
second time and I plan to go see it again this weekend just to get,0.023202935
my one last my one last shot and I've done this with a few movies,0.19735466
like Rise of the Planet of the Apes interstellar the wolf of Wall Street I've,0.17930424
done this with a couple movies not tons that I will literally go back and,0.11488919
see like multiple multiple times and I know Black Panther is probably the most anticipated,0.031297557
movie of 2018 judging by how I perform at the box-office judging by you know,0.020387879
the the reception on social media on review platform so I wanted to make this,0.019092102
video just to give my take on the movie the reception you know responding the,0.041402362
reception and just a quick overview of what the film was about I know a,0.013754002
lot of people wanted to know my thoughts on it so here we go Black,0.16529082
Panther for those who don't know is a Marvel superhero but in this movie touch,0.05075152
all the the protagonists here is portrayed less as a hero and more of a,0.035570696
a king with very internal conflicts so the film basically starts off in California and,0.023264797
hood and T'Challa father goes to see his brother two toddlers uncle and the conversation,0.11610182
starts off good but it ends up turning into a berating session when when two,0.053063694
challahs uncle realizes that the the his right-hand man has been a spy for from,0.07093585
Wakanda the entire time and the movie pretty much starts out with an Jobu arguing,0.032000653
that black people in general will fare a lot better just in that country in,0.390783
that system if they had the tools necessary to prop themselves up above the rest,0.03904628
he acknowledges that there is a lot of segregation a lot of racial divide and,0.15798643
attempt to prevent certain people from prevailing by not giving them the same tools as,0.096452296
other people within that same land so he's the one who's basically giving that information,0.021389645
to claw the film essentially starts off like that that's gonna be the the precursor,0.033051644
for majority of the conflict within the Black Panther movie all you idiots in the,0.6440923
comment section that we're going crazy talking about oh man y'all really think Black Panther,0.25648487
is gonna be about black people to some extent like shut up you haven't even,0.62220544
seen the film yet and why wouldn't it be a statement about that it's obvious,0.013461322
you looks too - Chawla after reuniting with Nakia goes back to Wakanda - you,0.1043294
know except his place on the throne he's challenged by Baku who I don't really,0.044633158
like the challenging system in this movie at all I mean if the purpose of,0.026393821
this movie is to be ruled by a good king I thought you should have,0.061452325
been judged by character not by brawn or by brute strength if that is the,0.03708798
case anyone with any whacked-out ideology could easily take the throne unless of course they're,0.23904154
saying you have to be from a specific tribe in order to be up for,0.06826447
consideration guess kill monger from what I know went into it and was able to,0.33150026
challenge - Charla pretty much based off his bloodline as we continue in the film,0.08028168
were introduced to characters like Everett what kabhi a Cole a Sheree I would say,0.06577336
there are elements of this movie that actually reminds me of The Dark Knight Rises,0.03140598
the woody sarcastic responses from shiri are kind of what I would get from an,0.15764387
Alfred or or a fox she's like the combination of those two characters in my,0.06025034
opinion so I think her character is awesome although the fight between Batman and Bane,0.038058482
was pretty anti-climatic in my opinion there is a defeat of T'Challa arise and a,0.07857149
defeat of Erich kill monger as we progressed with the film were introduced to Erich,0.12870106
kill monger who was portrayed by Michael B Jordan in this film we find out,0.65122473
the Erik's true goal was never to work under Klaw it was just to offer,0.01649456
Klaus a sacrifice to Wakanda so that he could be taken to see T'Challa so,0.14549562
that he could challenge him so that he could become the king take the throne,0.08159143
and thence in vibranium to other places of the world so that their people could,0.1394205
all thrive in all nations I'm very empathetic towards a character like Erik kill monger,0.43174818
because when you look at him you see someone who is a product not only,0.044169523
of their environment but someone who wants to see their people thrive you can see,0.030005103
with his time in office although short lives was not spent tormenting the people of,0.12334168
Wakanda it was spent honestly trying to use their resources Erik kill monger went about,0.23013733
his process in a completely wrong way you see that he ended up taking the,0.04711296
wrong approach which ultimately led to his downfall unfortunately Erik tries to be a dictator,0.20367259
as opposed to trying to be a king and that's probably one of the biggest,0.03791414
downfalls of the movie itself is that Erik kill monger doesn't come at this from,0.26578718
a very strategic standpoint at all for him to have been working towards this goal,0.041096374
for so long you would have thought he would have better planned it maybe tried,0.03845626
to get more people on his side maybe try to get more of what condemnation,0.07494558
to understand him I feel like his methods would have been better accepted had he,0.04349769
come at this from the standpoint of a king and less of a dictator I,0.1686939
have to give props to what in my opinion maybe the most underrated character in,0.026042605
this entire movie and it might possibly be the best portray as a koi a,0.04444225
that's played by Danai gurira i think her name is in every scene she's in,0.031698663
she dominates in the comedic effect and the sarcastic effect and the action affect her,0.03193081
fight scenes are probably the best in the entire film of course there's not a,0.04788524
lot of emphasis put on her character as she is a side character but still,0.019634891
she does the best in this movie to me and she's the most badass she,0.16631387
literally uses one of her Spears to hold on to the top of the car,0.0521198
that is being driven by Nikita in an attempt to catch claw in harpoons a,0.0439866
truck another thing to point out about Erik kill monger is his resolve he literally,0.26953405
kills his girlfriend or his love interest which immediately reminds me of the Sasuke that,0.6840274
was pulled on our tail where he tells Kody and everything's gonna be okay and,0.10229128
stabs her through the heart just to get danza some of you might not know,0.49562177
what that is I'm a bit of a weeaboo but still it shows how clear-cut,0.15929219
his method to get revenge is he finally meets up with the charla they fight,0.22806689
- Charlie loses in a really really bad way Zuri is also killed in this,0.24675176
fight which to me I guess is impactful for T'Challa as far as the audience,0.08039476
is concerned I don't think we had enough time with Zuri to really care about,0.039082866
him dying like that and I would have thought Erik kill monger would have taken,0.65305966
his time with Zuri since he is the one who ended up getting his father,0.062527925
killed he throws to Chara over the edge takes his place on the throne in,0.4830023
decisis to send vibranium or weapons with vibranium to the rest of the world so,0.14590338
that black people all over the world can thrive and survive and be on top,0.61437553
of course we find out that Sharla isn't actually dead he's actually saved by Baku,0.08264774
Nakia ends up getting one of the heart-shaped herbs trying to give it to Baku,0.04533559
because she doesn't actually know that T'Challa is alive once they figure it out they,0.10063497
give it a shower he wakes up he's ready to fight he goes back home,0.15834963
ready to take one kill monger everyone fights all this movie proved your allies become,0.5035087
your enemy there was no other army this is literally just whoa copy and a,0.06544276
koi yay end up fighting pretty much their army is pretty much on the battlefield,0.08829581
no one else is here the real enemy is kill monger in the east one,0.29482687
guy to Chawla and kill monger have their round two to Chawla wins by stabbing,0.5619156
Erik in the heart he's in praised by kil monger because apparently you know flipping,0.16486843
over a knife and stabbing me in the heart with it was a good move,0.67080295
instead of just killing him on the spot T'Challa takes Eric to a sunset because,0.50826705
that's what his father has always wanted him to see he sees it he acknowledges,0.042779956
it as beautiful vintage Charlotte says hey we can still save you Eric kill monger,0.5764238
delivers what might be the best line in any Marvel movie in history before his,0.074020974
death just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped off the boats,0.6619855
because they knew death was better than bondage and that one line right there proves,0.3266114
the entire difference between the character T'Challa and Eric kill monger one who wants to,0.23878677
see his people free and one who wants to see his people exist T'Challa ends,0.16368507
up taking on Eric kill mongers methods in the end of the film by going,0.46975765
back to California in the hood and buying a couple establishments in order to help,0.02211802
out their situation and that's essentially the movie in what I could say I hope,0.04996527
was about five minutes so after seeing it twice there were a few things that,0.033934344
I definitely could appreciate one of those things first being the connection between how Black,0.055158358
Panther and Wakanda deals with immigrants and how America deals with immigrants the whole purpose,0.06582591
of Wakanda was to preserve and protect their own people they really got into anyone,0.03438401
else's business and they made sure to stay secluded from the rest of the world,0.029752335
here at kill monger references this in the film you guys are up here sitting,0.25094426
nice and pretty but our people are out there dying and in the street and,0.24054822
their excuses we don't know who they are and we can't have people coming in,0.0526433
here that could threaten our lives and immediately there's a connection between that and how,0.16436289
America is dealing with the current immigration situation unfortunately though for America what Conda has,0.030735476
never participated in any other world events while America has another thing I love about,0.042748027
this movie is how it holds on the African culture like those African roots while,0.2802944
still advancing at the same time truly you can still hold the one two something,0.018171487
in an advance simultaneously it's an afro futuristic film one that pays a lot of,0.06642125
homage to the African lineage while also saying hey we can you know keep up,0.10276555
with the times as well another selling point for this film is how much stronger,0.04450012
the Wakanda people seem to be from knowing their path thus knowing what should be,0.04018308
important in what to protect having responsibilities etc you see Eric kill monger in this,0.3242368
film was a lot angrier he he has a point to prove there is nothing,0.13089152
that he really values I mean in the beginning of the film he even destroys,0.16890077
his own love interest there is nothing that this dude holds close to him and,0.08183422
that's because he doesn't know who he is he doesn't know what he wants to,0.026095819
protect he has a goal in mind of wanting people to have come out of,0.041322537
a certain situation but unlike the people of Wakanda he doesn't actually know who he,0.02709559
is or where he stems from which makes his character even better because he can,0.02159186
identify what those are the people that live in America that have no idea where,0.10900963
they come from either I mean watching this film it makes you really upset if,0.036226567
you were ever here that argument from someone that you shouldn't be upset about slavery,0.15405254
because you weren't affected by it do I don't even know my last name I,0.023186972
can't go back ten generations and still know exactly where I stem from any man,0.042428073
or woman is a million times greater when they know who they are versus when,0.05957451
they do not and we currently have millions of black youth in America who have,0.4811074
no idea who they are of course you can define and shape yourself to be,0.041690387
the person you want to be I'm just saying lineage wise knowing where you come,0.027673636
from knowing who you are knowing who your ancestors were we can't obtain access to,0.023350608
that information but it's not available just on the fly we were raised and brought,0.009174213
up learning European culture we weren't brought up learning African culture learning what gods were,0.121185154
worshipped learning what internal conflict happened with African nations early on we didn't learn that,0.041387063
stuff and there wasn't easy access to it when you were 9 10 11 years,0.047259968
old that's the thing that's so bittersweet about this movie is even though it's fiction,0.047699653
it tells a story of what could have been had we as black people knew,0.24957424
respected valued then advanced our culture the amount of lists that could have evinced an,0.01656773
entire civilization is maddening to think about the wealth the culture the identity crisis we,0.10234981
be ending the sense of helplessness we'd be ending and the idea of togetherness that,0.14024399
we'd be sparking when you look at a movie like this it's just like so,0.038433645
motivating to see this many black people just living in a nation together and just,0.3431155
supporting one another even those people like Baku who disagree with the challahs method still,0.0794655
have a place where they can call home you know this movie impacts in a,0.02467898
different way than just something that's supposed to be a superhero movie because in the,0.02044309
film I like out to Chara isn't represented as a black panther like a superhero,0.09721393
but more as the conflict within his own nation I got to tell you people,0.1085746
that I went to go see this movie with we were said we reset when,0.025407355
we left the theater because we we acknowledged and looked at that and saw like,0.014506325
this this could this could have happened this could have been us of course not,0.028483164
superhuman strength or anything like that but having a nation where all of us support,0.09882833
one another without having something as devastating as being enslaved and having your identity in,0.16060859
your history stripped from you and forced to settle in that same country is it's,0.038891956
really maddening if things have been another way like it sucks of course we can,0.24274123
make that happen still but there's way too many of us that have already been,0.017304752
colonized I just love the duality of this movie I love how Eric Gill monger,0.06229977
is portrayed and how T'Challa is portrayed one character with a father one that knows,0.015452881
his history one that knows exactly who he is and what he needs to protect,0.017189676
versus one who doesn't know his history doesn't know exactly where he stems from doesn't,0.024144836
really know what to protect has a vision has no one to guide him or,0.017698541
hadn't had anyone to guide him because he's fatherless grew up in the u.s. that's,0.08483819
more of a common story in the u.s. it shows a parallel I feel of,0.057802465
one black man that could end up this way if he had this in one,0.3792815
that could end up this way if he doesn't have this so I love the,0.031066736
movie for the discussion that it sparks in the conversation that it brings up especially,0.024427539
us as black people you know looking at it from that point of view there's,0.28014958
so much about the film that you can appreciate be a little bit saddened by,0.047369722
at the same time but of course with all things none of this is perfect,0.057873636
although I do praise this movie for its strong statement there are elements of the,0.033311732
film that I just could have done without one of those elements being the really,0.039574437
crappy at moment CGI that's done with the film especially during the fight with Eric,0.23446763
kill monger and T'Challa sometimes it's just noticeably oh six like really bad graphics at,0.48280007
some points and I know a lot of people might not notice it but if,0.02617298
you have a friend who's like a graphic designer or if you've watched movies that,0.042080183
really focus highly on that quality like if you've seen the movie interstellar you'll see,0.043485716
how beautiful cinematically these movies look I think the camerawork is amazing I love the,0.039598383
way though the land looks it's beautiful although there are some good acting in the,0.028755223
film I do think that at some points Michael B Jordan scared Aric kill monger,0.39726517
is a little bit over acted there's sometimes heavy emphasis placed on lines that are,0.023075221
just awkward to me like when Eric says he's gonna kill T'Challa or when he's,0.47540727
stripping himself down getting ready to fight I get that he's angry but at some,0.1110258
moments in the film the anger doesn't come off authentic it comes off as very,0.025951475
forced there are some moments in the film where Michael B Jordan acting does redeem,0.016098775
itself like the opening scene where he first gets introduced where he's acting very normal,0.09325808
and everything seems to just roll off the tongue especially is hey auntie lion when,0.07995973
he goes and meets up with T'Challa that was hilarious and I might speak to,0.03750638
that not being who Michael B Jordan really is I mean maybe Chadwick Boseman was,0.04574734
so easily portrayed as T'Challa in the film because that's a lot of who he,0.038711026
really is another thing in this film that I didn't really like was Klaw being,0.017069943
executed so early in the film I mean for him to have caused so much,0.2966407
havoc in regards to what Conda for him to be taken out so easily in,0.0914561
for him to not expect it was just really weird to me you have a,0.052930657
guy here who has information about what Conda who who's got someone on the inside,0.051783215
and he doesn't expect to be betrayed at any point I think he's killed literally,0.42869407
like within the first 40 minutes of the film the fight scenes are a little,0.03330641
bit anticlimactic now I did actually enjoy the fight scene between T'Challa and Baku he,0.18890151
had his own good reason for won in a fight to chala just feeling like,0.034687333
T'Challa isn't a good leader having technical developments be from a child pretty much was,0.053070348
one of his main concerns so everything he was saying was reasonable he also put,0.04712826
up a good fight but he's spared by de Charla in the end how the,0.046848886
fight scenes that T'Challa actually participates in I think that was the best one the,0.099695064
fight between him and Erik kill monger is really anti climactic in the end for,0.31031007
me not a lot is going on not a lot is happening correct me if,0.046123832
I'm wrong but if they are having their powers of the Black Panthers set before,0.16526754
they begin fighting why wasn't T'Challa a little bit more hurt after he was stabbed,0.2323983
in the chest by a spear from Baku do walk that off like he didn't,0.13979034
even get touched same thing happened when he was thrown off a cliff dude had,0.21598513
every inch of his body sliced open and then was thrown off of a cliff,0.6121382
from however many stories high and somehow manages to have his body recover another question,0.015305211
I have about this film is if kill monger burned all the heart-shaped herbs in,0.6619754
T'Challa pretty much has the last one can they just make more or is that,0.02319961
just the end of the Black Panther I have my discrepancies with it obviously I,0.21773988
have my issues maybe there's some plot holes here and there maybe some things that,0.038973775
I don't like like the CGI being bad especially during some of the fight scenes,0.072868206
I just think the good really outweighs the bad in this film to me and,0.0750979
for everything that this film says and for all the possibilities that you could walk,0.030705541
out of the theater thinking about after viewing it I think it deserves what I'm,0.04600809
about to give it black panther the movie thank you guys for watching if you,0.25415224
enjoyed the movie please go watch it again go watch it one more time support,0.027047032
this movie it's made amazing money so far I want to see it reach a,0.05476058
billion it probably will be I'm going to go see it again this weekend just,0.01916394
to get one last good look at it I've already seen it twice but I,0.015333149
want to see it one more time I hope you guys did enjoy the film,0.061752323
