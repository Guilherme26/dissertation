hey everyone it's Mariana I haven't seen you in a bit but I am back,0.045153998
and today let's talk about get out this movie is written and directed by Jordan,0.034356736
Peele it's his feature film directorial debut which is really impressive and is definitely not,0.03377869
your regular horror film I don't even know if I would classify this as a,0.13455668
horror movie because it's the kind of thing that somewhere in between thriller and horror,0.079945095
film but what really surprised me is the amount of humor and satire in it,0.043009445
the story centers around Chris played by Danielle Kaluga who goes to meet his girlfriend's,0.028856331
parents at a pretty secluded location he has some concerns about this because Roth has,0.039385524
not told her parents that he's black and when they gets there things go from,0.3220468
slightly awkward to straight-up weird and that's all I'm going to tell you about the,0.08030829
plot because I think it's definitely one of those movies that's best seen knowing as,0.02132978
little as possible about it so if you haven't seen get out yet which you,0.034171816
absolutely should go see it in theaters that's all you're going to get from me,0.04450278
for the plot this movie is filled with tension and suspense it is absolutely a,0.029429056
very effective thriller it kind of reminded me of the invitation if you've seen that,0.025618218
movie but I did enjoy get out more partly because of the humor and partly,0.04331942
because I think it's just a more clever film in general it does take it's,0.030996893
time to get going also kind of like the invitation it which surprised me a,0.024281863
little bit because it's not a long movie it's about an hour and 43 minutes,0.07790897
I believe but the first 30 to 40 minutes felt longer than the rest of,0.02211137
the film to me and I kind of wish things picked up a little bit,0.08112447
quicker I did really like how it builds up this atmosphere of unease with small,0.06252327
things that escalate it throughout the film one of those things where the situation just,0.009311906
feels off and it may not be anything major or openly aggressive to begin with,0.051195193
but it just puts you on edge the entire time because you feel uncomfortable along,0.049011394
with the character and that's another thing I really enjoyed about get out though wheyhey,0.016869722
films this and the way he tells the story Jordan Peele does a really great,0.037059378
job putting the audience kind of in the shoes of the main character and making,0.025180526
the audience see the situation from Chris's perspective making the audience uncomfortable because of what,0.01782559
he's experiencing and Daniel coleus performance really helps with that as well I would say,0.053738855
in general the performances across the board are very strong not just for a horror,0.031511746
film but for any film I think a lot of us can relate to this,0.013692806
type of anxiety because even though we may not have been in this exact situation,0.018529356
I think a lot of us have experienced being in a social environment or in,0.014510981
a small gathering where things just feel wrong and something about it is passive-aggressive and,0.048417386
it's not something you can easily explain unless things escalate but you know you're not,0.020653952
feeling right in the situation this is also a film that has layers to it,0.02862751
while it is definitely entertaining and fun because of the comedy and because of the,0.038234755
thrills it is a film that has some social commentary it's a film that deals,0.025023544
with racism and stereotypes and the way people treat each other I don't want to,0.23318599
really ruin anything once again but it all comes back to the awkwardness of the,0.062851205
situation and to the perspective and to the way you can interpret what somebody is,0.0069272225
saying and you can try to explain it away but that doesn't mean you're going,0.015333814
to feel any more comfortable I do wish that the filmmakers have stayed away from,0.024604477
jump scares because the jump scares and get out are so unnecessary there's a kind,0.08901687
of jump scare that just startles you with a loud sound and nothing scary is,0.07187642
really happening and I find things like that annoying as you know and they're not,0.0764888
really all over the place but there are a few so that was kind of,0.040956024
a bit disappointing for me overall though get-out is a film that you should definitely,0.18351153
check out it just works on so many levels it is an effective and suspenseful,0.04621563
thriller it is a clever set tired had me laughing quite a bit throughout the,0.10281278
film even though it never really turned into a comedy it was just part of,0.02665657
the entertaining experience it was smart and funny it was well shot it was well,0.2060566
written and all of that makes it very much rewatchable so absolutely check it out,0.03191019
