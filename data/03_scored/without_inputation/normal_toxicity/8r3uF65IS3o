he's not gonna be too happy about that one thing I've always loved about llamo,0.12601313
del Toro and his films is his ability to visually paint a picture I mean,0.13467726
this dude is one of the greatest visual storytellers that I've ever seen guys a,0.14562479
master class at subtly and visually laying it out for you it's like a road,0.14304134
map with filled with all kinds of emotion all kinds of subtext and all kinds,0.07138858
of layers and visually you just got to see it with your eyes I mean,0.1931277
the is poetry on screen and this movie is no different because this is not,0.054628443
only one of the best looking and gorgeous looking films of the entire year made,0.117383525
a film that has a lot of visual subtext and a lot of visual storytelling,0.062427875
that will go unnoticed unless you're actually paying attention it's not enough to say that,0.08781115
this movie is eggs on a tip beautiful I mean duh of course it is,0.294044
Guillermo del Toro always has a beautiful looking movie I like what he did with,0.14989641
the lighting and the contrasts in this film somehow it's a little bit more of,0.089757055
a grounded reality in this film it takes place in the 1960s so it's not,0.075621404
as much of a fantastical epic as you're used to seeing from guillermo del toro,0.17772447
but somehow in a grounded fantasy it's still somehow manages to pop visually I'm not,0.061616972
entirely sure how he and the cinematographer did that for this film but kudos to,0.043934245
both of those guys Foreman says in this film are so goddamn good that I,0.7247358
don't think it's enough for me to get out of this review and not say,0.102594584
that every single one of the main principle characters and actors in this film need,0.042674735
to be nominated for something give a damn if it's a Golden Globe I don't,0.6496687
give a damn if it's an Oscar I don't care if someone just draws a,0.7423417
picture of a golden statue and a piece of paper and hands it to them,0.31089434
and says you were awesome because guess what everybody in this movie was freaking awesome,0.40316853
Sally Hawkins was mesmerizing as the main character of Eliza she doesn't say anything in,0.11289505
the movie she can't talk obviously because she's mute but her facial reactions and her,0.45661184
eyes tell everything they tell the entire story all I can really say about her,0.09804156
performance in this movie is that she moves mountains emotionally without saying a single word,0.15378663
everyone else was really great in the movie to Octavia Spencer I mean she just,0.13982978
adds something to every movie that she's in she has some very funny parts she,0.22089055
has some very welcome levity and human though she brought some humor there's also some,0.17281447
very touching and heartfelt moments with her character too and I would say that her,0.20875852
character just like most of the other characters in this film are trying to find,0.050806522
themselves in someone else they're trying to find some part of themselves trying to find,0.07184416
something that they've lost within themselves and they're trying to see it reflected in someone,0.15965316
else her character represents that too Jones is great as this amphibian sea creature monster,0.5154597
whatever the hell this thing is prosthetics and the design of the creature are very,0.42667684
well done and Doug Jones does a lot of miming and a lot of hand,0.102758095
movements and a lot of eye twitches and I decided to describe and all I,0.09692668
can know is that Doug Jones was great in this movie Michael Shannon oh my,0.065890834
god to do is just I hate him in this movie Michael Sata does such,0.5883243
a great job at playing a great villain we have seen that in other films,0.10948711
that he's done but in this movie in particular he was such a slimeball oh,0.49652305
my god I absolutely hated Michael Shannon in this movie I hated him I just,0.4608855
I despised him at a cellular level he was awful he was disgusting he made,0.637444
me sick to my stomach but I I just I couldn't turn away from the,0.161914
screen while he was on it even though this is a film that seems like,0.087383315
it has a simple issue story to it it's a romance between a monster and,0.3149779
a girl who can't speak it seems kind of simple but there are so many,0.20910929
layers and themes and subtext interwoven throughout the narrative of the script and the screenplay,0.057658862
that just make this movie pop on a more emotional level and on a more,0.08365712
so Libra level than your typical Beauty meets the Beast type of story there are,0.40313572
some very subtle references in ways that the film brings up and addresses things that,0.022943266
are not only prevalent in our society today but we're also prevalent during that era,0.05463084
in the 1960s there are some heavy themes about prejudice about judging somebody who's different,0.06292395
than you subconscious prejudices that we have about people even what we don't say anything,0.16558638
it also says a lot about people with disabilities and the way we take people,0.17016104
like that for granted and the way that sometimes not saying things is sometimes the,0.0474945
most powerful statement that a person can make a real issue with this movie is,0.108781144
that the movie does hit a lull sometime between the second act and the third,0.09233633
act there's a point in the movie where the story is going along and then,0.03463443
something happens and then the story just kind of stops for a little bit and,0.085966915
there's a little bit of a lull there's not much going on from a story,0.0682641
perspective it's not that the story comes to a crashing halt it's just kind of,0.09521342
like a plane circling overhead it's just it's it's hovering it's not really going anywhere,0.09595524
there's a little nitpick is that I wish we had found out a little bit,0.22377868
