hey there guys,0.05492894
so before we talk about Wonder Woman I first need to show you this Wonder Woman is the latest film in the DC Universe of comic book movies and they needed this to be a good movie and not only that I think we all needed this to be a phenomenal movie to restore our faith in the DC United was this a good movie hang on just one second and we'll talk about that this will be directed by patty Jenkins who's mostly known for drinking TV shows,0.0943752
and I would say her most famous movie is monster which is also about female empowerment in a very dark weird disgusting way,0.52564955
now let's talk about Batman V Superman like it or hate,0.23991375
it,0.046851434
one of the best surprises about that movie was gal gadot as Wonder Woman and as far as gal gadot performance gal,0.1103538
gadot,0.09137883
gal,
"gadot Yaga doesn't matter how I say her name 27,000 people down below in the comments will say I said it wrong even if I say it right",0.18139476
I'm just going to refer to gal gadot as Wonder Woman from now on because in my head,0.18221259
that's who she is now now as far as her performance goes in this film as Wonder Woman,0.101265244
I really bought into it,0.09707122
she brought a different element that I wasn't quite expecting she have subtleties about her and I really enjoy that I really enjoyed her natural foreign accent as Wonder Woman,0.09494944
it made me bind to the character and you really felt like she was from this foreign magical and mystical faraway land in the movie when she's holding up her shield and swinging her sword and wrapping the lasso of truth around people,0.13697372
I was thinking to myself that is Wonder Woman,0.17356588
and I was also thinking I want her to wrap the lasso of truth around me that just sounds like a really good time,0.22934186
now the first act of this movie is a straight-up origin story and it takes place on the island of thermus kara you see a young Princess Diana training to be a warrior one day,0.12588586
and I really appreciated how quickly the film progressed and didn't drag out her training sequences and it just got on with the rest of the story,0.051875886
and one of the best things about this film is the chemistry between Chris Pines character and Wonder Woman throughout,0.0191083
this movie Chris Pines character is this world war one spy named Steve Trevor's and he and Princess Diana essentially had the same objective - in the war the most interesting thing is they both have different beliefs on how to stop the war ones realistic and ones mythological and for the most,0.09060969
part I said it was really clever how they tied in this mythological backstory into real-life events like world war,0.23988678
one but now let's talk about the character of Steven Rogers in this film that's,0.05571045
right I just said Steven Rogers aka Captain America and I don't feel mistaken when I say that because in the film Wonder Woman the character Steven Trevor's is essentially Captain America without the Super Soldier,0.087279804
Serum and speaking of Captain America the First Avenger it also feels like the film Wonder Woman borrows a few plot elements from that movie and puts it into this one and that's not even a,0.038736243
complaint I actually don't,0.071230136
mind and I think Wonder Woman is the better movie I do have a few other quick positives to mention about the film and we'll dive into everyone's favorite part the negatives with the movie one other aspect,0.15378255
I really enjoyed about this film was the fish-out-of-water story you had this character a Wonder Woman who's never been off to this island filled with the chicks,0.1856804
she's never even seen a dude before and then you can't go and place her in this new environment everything that she's seeing and doing for the first time was really entertaining and comedic to watch and speaking of the comedy aspect in this movie sometimes when it comes to superhero comic book movies when they interject that forced comedy to make people laugh and add levity to the movie sometimes it takes me out of the movie and I'm just like let's take serious let's go into battle kick some ass,0.7453695
I don't need to laugh about something stupid,0.7453698
but in this movie it works,0.07051894
but one of the best things that this movie does is it makes you buy into the character or Wonder Woman,0.06918042
and there's one scene that you've seen in the trailers,0.083938666
so I'm not spoiling anything there's a scene in this film that takes place during World War 1 in the trenches,0.17874621
you have soldiers they're down-and-out there's blood,0.47742462
there's guts there's gore it's pg-13,0.22526649
so there's no guts or gore blood but it was the one scene in this film where I bought in to Wonder Woman it's where I got goosebumps all over me because she climbs out of this trench,0.38583404
she D robes wearing the costume walking straight at the enemies,0.3170817
I just love scenes like that like it literally gives me goose bumps down,0.15987699
my arms,0.11433224
now here are my negatives with the movie Wonder Woman as I hold this sword,0.25468963
now Wonder Woman once again is a comic book superhero movie and this movie has a lot of cliches in it that you've seen in other move,0.17565134
but I will say this movie handles those cliches as well as it possibly can,0.1552959
now let's talk about the villains of this film there's multiple villains in this movie,0.09793252
and I didn't really enjoy any of them,0.09601607
you have the dude who played William Stryker in x-men origins playing once again another villain he craves power and he'll do anything to get it and I hate to keep comparing this movie to Captain America the First Avenger but this Nazi character and Wonder Woman was essentially Red Skull but without the Red Skull and much like Captain America the First Avenger he also has a sidekick character who's an evil scientist named dr.,0.49036035
poison and yeah as far as dr.,0.43707183
poison goes in this film she was the most cliched over-the-top character in the entire film and every time she was on screen it sort of took me out of the movie she just really came across like this very heavy-handed one-dimensional evil scientist and also at the very end of the movie much like every comic book movie that comes out nowadays it gets super heavy-handed with the CG to the point where it just feels like actors are standing in front of a green screen with a fan blowing on them,0.24147977
and it's forgivable for the most part because in a superhero movie with godlike powers you have to have this big destruction battle scene,0.15035276
but I just was expecting a little something more out of this movie something a little bit more subtle,0.16169336
now here are my final flicking thoughts on Wonder Woman,0.18160309
this is arguably the best DC Universe film since Man of Steel,0.048725206
I prefer Man of Steel just a little bit more over this movie but I can understand if you like this movie more than Man of Steel,0.09025728
I really felt like they did everything that they possibly could with the character of Wonder Woman to make you like the character to make you get behind,0.15054405
the character to give her an origin story that was interesting Wonder Woman isn't a perfect movie,0.15300925
but when it comes to a Wonder Woman movie I really feel like it was the best thing that they possibly could have done with her so I'm going to give the movie Wonder Woman aa a B+,0.12880589
it's a solid movie,0.062060613
it's really entertaining go check it out,0.086894624
