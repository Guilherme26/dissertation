films that I've got the chance to see recently eighth grade this film was absolutely,0.11100287
spectacular this movie is about a young girl named Kayla she likes to record videos,0.23275174
and post them online and she likes to talk about a lot of different issues,0.14784591
and a lot of different things that she's thinking about related to life she is,0.07072478
finishing her last week of eighth grade and we get to see a lot of,0.21257421
different issues that I would say lots of teenagers and maybe probably even adults face,0.121742986
in real life issues related to confidence rejection sexual desires and confusion are all talked,0.31089434
about and discussed in this movie and I really enjoyed watching it I thought that,0.07121776
Kayla was a very relatable and likable character she is she has lots of things,0.10797568
to like about her but she's not perfect and I like that because it didn't,0.1589014
make her seem fake all the kids that talked in this movie really feel like,0.24239752
they are the age that they are there's a lot of movies like darkest minds,0.17835426
which is also in theaters currently where you can tell that adults wrote the script,0.05244293
for these kids and even though an adult probably wrote the script for the kids,0.095214106
that are talking in this movie it didn't feel that way I really felt like,0.070255674
that's how an eighth grader probably talks for the most part it felt very realistic,0.1618763
from all the characters from and and not just Kayla but all the kids that,0.0757222
are in this movie I did think the plot was very interesting even though there's,0.050769035
lots of issues that are dealt with I didn't feel like it was very random,0.058725376
I thought that the structure and flow of the story was very well done the,0.030133026
editing in this movie is done extremely well from the way it cuts to different,0.07438244
things while kala is talking on video we don't just see her face talking forever,0.41982916
while she's talking about something we see a scenario that relates to what she's talking,0.1585488
about it shows us something in her life that relates to what she's talking about,0.24956046
so for example she might be making a video on confidence and instead of us,0.047366682
just watching her face we get to see a scenario where she had to step,0.2652095
up even though she didn't feel very confident and do what she's talking about in,0.089088224
one of her videos and be that confident person so I liked the editing in,0.11256429
this movie from the cuts and also from the audio editing there's some very interesting,0.09076164
times where the audio just cut in cut out and I it was done very,0.25590137
well that I took note of it I think that the only negative that I,0.12688205
had with this movie and it's not that big of a deal but I did,0.096371844
think that some of the characters that were not Kayla that were supposed to be,0.057261102
like the main character weren't very well humanized it felt like they were just mean,0.24246451
for no reason and I get that there's eighth graders that are gonna be mean,0.06169744
for no reason or for a silly reason but I would have wanted to know,0.30954
more about why they were like that because it just felt very forced so that,0.08149501
way the creators of this movie could push the plot in the direct that they,0.07446453
wanted but other than that though I really enjoyed this movie I thought that it,0.07055133
was an excellent experience and I think that if you want to go watch a,0.046352286
relatable character and get lost in experiences that I think you'll be able to look,0.14841002
at and say man I have felt that way before - or I know somebody,0.10615755

Facebook is for old people and I think that this is a very to date,0.09877785
movie I don't know how that'll do viewing this in 10 years but as someone,0.10722423
that might want to see a teenager that is going through a lot of things,0.09387535
that are relatable as of today I think that it will be very hard to,0.06740187
