what's going on everybody a happy Thanksgiving to you all I hope you spend an amazing day with your friends and family I hope you eat a lot of turkey get stuffed take a nap go back for seconds and thirds and just have a wonderful day does Thanksgiving tends to revolve around family why not talk about Pixar's latest film Coco which has a lot to do with family and this is the perfect day to talk about Coco so I'm gonna talk about Coco how many times gonna say Coco alone review Coco now first of all on a scale of 1 to just woke up how bad is my hair look don't answer that don't answer that so in Coco there's a young boy named Miguel who lives in Mexico and he is a musician but he's kind of a secret musician because his family has his hatred for music and their family music is basically banned because one of his relatives you know music kind of tore her marriage apart and ultimately Mike ruined her life so she kind of passed that hatred down into her family so Miguel was trying to secretly follow his passion to be a musician even though his family's trying to stop him from doing so and on dia de los muertos in Mexico which is the Day of the Dead down there it's basically their Halloween in case you didn't know just fun fact Miguel decides to visit the grave of you know his idol this musician was voiced by Benjamin Bratt who whose guitar is laying upon his grave so Miguel decides to break into the cemetery break into that grave in particular to get this guitar he strums the guitar he's transported to the land of the Dead where he tries to track down this idol of his to kind of pursue his passion and to be around someone who actually supports his passion and has a love for music and once you know he needs someone to inspire him to follow his dream so that he can be a musician just like you know his idol follows as a family-friendly adventure in the in the land of the Dead where it's colorful its vibrant its funny its imaginative and it's just so much fun there actually is a lot more to the plot that meets the eye in this movie which I really enjoy there's some twist there's some turns not everything is what it seems and I love that Pixar kind of throw a lot of swerves in there and also ventured into some dark territory but more on that later and in this voice cast we have a guy el Garcia Bernal we've got Benjamin Bratt we've got a soul of Newtown we got some you know familiar voices popping in and out and the voice cast lens this is great you know validity to these characters you know everyone commits the voice acting all around is top-notch and they really bring these characters to life no voice feels out of place no one feels like they're kind of just a lazily going through the script all the voice actors really bring in their top performances to the table and Pixar once again just knows how to make these beautifully realized worlds I mean not only do they capture Mexico beautifully I love that they really dug into the backstory and the culture that has to do with Dia de los Muertos I mean the whole idea of kind of creating these beautiful shrines for family members bringing these offerings to their graves so that on the day of the Dead you know our family members you know can visit us and kind of you know be with us in spirit I just love that whole idea I really love that Mexico has embraced that holiday and I really think Pixar paid a lot of respect to that here because you know just you know seeing pictures and actually like seeing videos of you know people celebrating that holiday you know hearing stories about that holiday I feel like Pixar really nailed you know the culture that goes into at the heart that goes into that holiday and I really feel like they didn't you know ham fist their interpretation of that holiday and I felt like they treated it with respect which I really appreciate it and the colors in this movie just the animation is absolutely stunning I mean this movie is bursting with color I mean the the CGI rendering is just absolutely incredible I mean just some there was one scene where character is swimming through water and the water looked so realistic I honestly thought I was watching a live-action movie there are countless shots in this movie where my jaw just dropped because I couldn't believe that this is actually an animated film it's just it's amazing what Pixar is able to do it every time they come out with a new film whether it be a sequel or something original the animation just looks flawless and looks even better than it did in there previously when cocoa is absolutely no exception this is probably I think this might be the most beautiful movie they've ever made in my opinion I just think it's absolutely gorgeous and rich with calm and also I love the story of this movie I mean you get a little bit of the story in the trailer I mean you just see a young boy he's trying to track down an old relative who is this great famous musician and the day they know in the land of the dead but there's so much more to the story and so much they're not telling you which I actually really appreciate it because we travelers nowadays they kind of just tend to spoil everything for you and there's no really there's no surprises left when you actually go see the film itself but in this movie the story is really engaging it keeps you guessing like I said before or Pixar actually goes to a dark place when the big twist of the movie is revealed I will say there is a twist in this moment not obviously gonna tell you what it is but I think it's really well done it's really well handled it's kind of multi-layer and I really enjoyed that Pixar wasn't afraid to go to that territory wasn't afraid to go to that dark place to create a more mature story not just for you know kids but for adults to appreciate as well I really loved that you know Pixar not only caters to kids but adults who are inevitably gonna be taking their kids to see this movie I like that balance story is great I think there's a lot of great humor in here there's a lot of jokes that really work very few jokes fall flat I think that the humor in this movie really helps bring this amazing sense of adventure to the proceedings I mean the story never felt stale or boring I was never you know disinterested in the Smoky's never bored watching and not at all the movie flies by the pacing is great the thing that 100% made me fall in love with this movie is the heart the heart is the core of Coco and kind of the core of Pixar in general when they do need their story's justice and the heart just sells the crap out of this movie there is so much heart bursting from this movie it's not melodramatic it's not haphazardly done it's done with such earnest tea that you can't help but get completely involved with these characters get completely emotionally invested in this story and there are multiple times where I teared up during the course of this movie worried just you know those tears felt earned that you know that drama felt earned and it's just I really loved that Pixar is able to pull off that kind of drawing I mean there's a sometimes there's better drama and Pixar movies than there are and live-action films it's sad to say but it's the truth I mean the heart is what brings these characters to life it's what makes this adventure so engaging in it was what ultimately makes this movie work so well because you know having a fun adventure you know family felt is one thing but having that with heart that's what makes it a fully rounded movie and that's what makes it a fully rounded movie going experience because I'm the kind of movie goer yeah I want to have fun but I also want to be emotionally invested in the story and the characters you know and I want to I don't want that story to end because I feel so attached to them and that's kind of how I felt with Coco I didn't want it to end I wanted the 20-minute frozen short that came before the movie to heaven because that sucked and I like the first frozen I just didn't want to see that but this was really a movie I could have watched probably two more hours over and just enjoyed the I mean I really don't have any problems with Coco I think it's funny I think it's smart I think it's imaginative I think it's super colorful I think it has a ton of heart I think it's got a great voice performances all around I think it's one of Pixar's most engaging movies I think it's one of their most culturally culture my god what are words it's one of their most culturally rich movies I think that they've ever made and I want them to make more movies like Coco if this movie shows that Pixar still has an imagination that we came to you know fall in love with so long ago that they're still capable of making great original films and you know if we get more films like Coco from Pixar they're just gonna be a force to be reckoned with again I think this is a step way in the right direction for Pixar I want them to make more movies like this yeah we got the Incredibles - coming out next year but I'm always more excited for the original movies because when they're like Coco they're mesmerizing and they're unforgettable so in the end I'm gonna give Coco I'm gonna give it an A this is one of my favorite movies of the years so far I loved every second of it it was just one of those movies where he was kind of having an off day and I got to see it and it just it completely turned my mood around it was the right movie at the right time and Pixar just kind of hit that sweet spot for me and I loved every second of Coco if you family films if you've loved movies with great humor and great heart you're gonna love it I highly recommend Coco seat with your family it's Thanksgiving weekend spend some time with them see a great movie you will not be wasting your time not in the slightest so that is my review of Coco I really hope you enjoyed it I really hope you take it into consideration if consider seeing the film anout which you should do because you should be thankful for good movies not just friends and family and other things that are probably more important than
