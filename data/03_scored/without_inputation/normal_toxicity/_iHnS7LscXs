hey guys so I feel like I haven't filmed in like a million years just,0.07526352
plethora of reasons and I apologize this video is so late I actually saw this,0.13669997
movie really late I saw it like five or six days after it was even,0.055816773
released so but we're here now we're doing the review now I hope that you,0.101897165
will still be interested at this point hopefully you've seen the movie because most of,0.07329274
this video is going to be all about the spoilers and just the movie in,0.14913946
general and like the theories the just you know the details about the film because,0.0299496
it's really hard to review it without spoilers but there will be a chunk at,0.0576972
the beginning of this video where I do review it if you have yet to,0.08105259
see it whether or not I recommend it also I just wanna say today's makeup,0.10383482
is inspired by the movie so apparently all you have to do to look a,0.08872132
little bit more jarring is to remove your eyebrows so I'm rocking my natural eyebrows,0.6364068
today also another thing I got new glasses so you're gonna see me rocking some,0.18217584
glasses a lot more in videos and last thing I want to talk about before,0.115753084
we get into the review is you might have seen a bunch of other horror,0.31938863
creators talk about this and I'm really late to jump on this bandwagon but I,0.10288114
did really want to mention it because it's so exciting and I'm so pumped about,0.07757095
it it's currently an 80s horror documentary project that's being created right now and is,0.106797256
being funded on IndieGoGo I will have a link to it down below it's called,0.10250173
in search of darkness and it's backed by people like John Carpenter Elvira just back,0.10793124
to today painting hotter and a plethora of other horror icons in this community but,0.14895697
I'm so excited because we get a true thorough 80s horror documentary which i think,0.24243337
is one of the best decades for horror and arguably one of the most important,0.12998319
decades of horror today is actually the last day to back it I know I,0.13893457
apologize I'm so late on announcing this but hopefully you've seen other creators talk about,0.1257611
it and you've already backed it and gotten the perks but I will have a,0.09306322
link of course and I'm not sponsored to say that by the way it isn't,0.049393702
affiliate link though I do want to disclose that so now let's get into the,0.065425366
us review there is so much to unpack with this movie and I can tell,0.08106053
you right now I'm not going to cover every single detail every twist and every,0.13674621
sim aspect of symbolism in the spell there's just no way that I can get,0.08267349
into that so I'm gonna talk about my favorite things about the film and my,0.06627074
favorite kind of forms of symbolism and commentary and things like that so just gonna,0.10639176
go over the ones that I find the most interesting about the film but of,0.047901537
course there's going to be literally so many more things about this and there's so,0.053934257
many videos already made about all the things little easter eggs within this movie that,0.09261573
you can check out and also just do a google search and you there's tons,0.13645951
of articles about it so if you want more details definitely research a little bit,0.093801744
more but I'm gonna share with you my opinion about the film and my thoughts,0.08807426
actually went in with a little bit of a smaller expectation I tried to go,0.09842859
in with 0 because it's it was a little bit risky I it looked really,0.10942628
good right the trailer I think undeniably looked decent it definitely isn't really what the,0.062274907
movies about I'll tell you that but because get out created by Jordan Peele of,0.08595281
course was so well received in the horror community although some would argue it's not,0.098353624
a true horror film and you know there are a lot of people that didn't,0.16491374
actually like get out but I think in general it was well-received so I didn't,0.05769403
want to hype up this movie too much because although I was excited I was,0.106739715
worried it wasn't going to live up to the hype because we've only ever seen,0.08912978
get out from Jordan peels so we were like is he a one-hit wonder is,0.15529686
he gonna be able to like make a name for himself as a horror creator,0.24073943
so short answer does us live up to its hype and live up to get,0.06807588
out and the Jordan Peele name absolutely now after I saw the trailer of course,0.06388581
I was excited but I was worried because it looked kind of like I was,0.06375696
worried it was gonna be what you see is what you get and it was,0.0651713
gonna be kind of a basic home invasion film with a twist the fact that,0.15225023
they were like twins or like they looked just like them it's us you know,0.12033636
there's also nervous going in because the trailer portrays it kind of like a home,0.054075476
invasion film and that's actually one of my least favorite horror genres they're just not,0.17584977
that terrifying to me with a few exceptions such as hush really loved hush but,0.23590514
generally they're not my favorite kind of movies because I just don't they're kind of,0.14905311
boring to me is that weird to say and without giving anything away or giving,0.15111035
away spoilers just yet I do want to say that this isn't really a home,0.07650804
invasion film I would not consider a home invasion movie so don't go into it,0.13279836
expecting a home invasion movie of course because it is a Jordan Peele movie and,0.12920637
he has just you know declared that his running theme within his movies and his,0.09748693
work will be social commentary what is the social comp well I'll get into the,0.04044309
specific of what the social commentary isn't spoilers because I don't want to ruin it,0.15049109
if you haven't seen it yet but of course there is social commentary in this,0.038611803
film and I do think that this movie did a much better job than get,0.10164645
out in being a standalone true horror film I feel like anyone can go into,0.17660517
this and enjoy it simply as a movie and as a horror movie versus get,0.18214425
out where it was kind of like more in-your-face social commentary is very much more,0.078918956
literal although there was smaller pieces of symbolism throughout it of course this movie can,0.08634114
definitely stand on its own without having the viewer have to think too hard about,0.14007872
the social commentary while you're watching it of course I was doing that so I'm,0.057470184
trying to put together the pieces and figure out what he's talking about but you,0.07682729
can enjoy this film without having to think too much about it because it's not,0.08860021
right in your face fully it's just a really good horror movie in itself and,0.49113172
then you have the underlying social commentary aspect along with it so in my opinion,0.09891123
I feel like that was a really successful portrayal of what he was trying to,0.056044094
say this scares in the movie I think were so effective and my job was,0.074216336
just on the floor sometimes like I I wasn't truly terrified like I wasn't shaking,0.10323857
in my chair or anything I tend to not do that anyway with most horror,0.18772697
movies I feel like I'm a little bit more desensitized but it was truly terrifying,0.12994213
like there were moments that were horrific and scary at least to me as far,0.12299672
as criticism obviously I've been hyping it up a lot and I do have criticism,0.036759462
of this film obviously if you look too deep into things and specifics a lot,0.15179113
of the underlying symbolisms and things that he's trying to reach for sometimes they don't,0.050098117
make sense and they wouldn't be realistic in the real world granted it's not it's,0.06907654
a movie so I feel like we can kind of forgive some of the smaller,0.089066654
inconsistencies or imperfections within the movie because after all it is about the symbolism while,0.06162586
still maintaining the atmosphere of a horror movie so you have to be able to,0.1921108
kind of look past those smaller things that just don't make sense or don't really,0.06510992
add up I think it's a given for me to say that the acting was,0.0994874
OnPoint like amazing the visuals were great only had really one or two issues with,0.17095149
it and those I'll get into more in the spoiler section although I don't really,0.06969235
consider them too spoilery but there's two scenes that I feel like we could have,0.0883501
just deleted and it would have been better another thing I want to say is,0.07387214
that Jordan Peele has like a really good eye for detail and literally everything in,0.085919335
the film paid off in the end like everything you know had significance later on,0.059398226
any time we saw something happen or an item or something it had meaning later,0.104184516
on in the film and that's so satisfying as a viewer to have that kind,0.07260134
of payoff for everything that we're taking in it all comes back together I felt,0.15167156
that the explanation for the whole movie and the plot and everything is just enough,0.049868084
I feel like it might have been a little spoon fed to the viewer and,0.15481225
I usually hate that but in the moment it didn't feel like it but maybe,0.12942208
it's explained in a way that some people would find a little spoon fed because,0.103047416
the viewer vent is not left to come to their own conclusions about the film,0.069069736
and about the symbolism and commentary and everything like that but I think had we,0.053294566
not had the type of explanation that we did there's a certain scene where things,0.076892056
are like rounded out and like explained more in depth if we hadn't had that,0.05440274
I feel like there would be than those people that are like what is going,0.15465263
what is the reason for this why is that happening okay so with that general,0.08399616
review obviously I really enjoyed the film I really loved it and I'm actually going,0.062841095
to go see it again on my anniversary on Tuesday my boyfriend are gonna go,0.18581136
watch it again because we want to go in with knowing the whole film watching,0.037046537
it from the beginning again so I do recommend it I think it's amazing I'm,0.060381185
gonna get into spoilers now and pretty much the rest of the movie like the,0.09368981
whole movie the entire movie - and talk about my favorite pieces of commentary and,0.09496277
symbolism and little Easter eggs and things that I liked about it obviously like I,0.27103335
said it's not gonna be all of it I'm not gonna unpack all of that,0.11385525
stuff so yeah spoilers ahead talking about the whole rest of the movie the ending,0.11755182
the twist everything like that so you haven't seen it yet I do not recommend,0.09871367
continuing continuing to watch this video because it'll ruin it for you just go watch,0.3060843
it just go see it you need to see it in theatres and experience it,0.09334467
so the first thing I'm going to talk about is actually the social commentary part,0.041520506
of the film I think by now the social commentary aspect at the film is,0.026874375
pretty obvious there are a bunch of other theories floating around my boyfriend and I,0.34553584
figured it out on the drive home and like piece together all the things that,0.0657044
reinforce the theory basically it's about the class system in America the issue of homelessness,0.14616023
the lower class middle class and upper class are all represented within the movie we,0.079097986
have the lower class of the untethered Underground we have the middle class of the,0.241869
Wilsons the main family and then we have the upper class which is represented by,0.02361528
the Tyler family who seems to always have like similar things to the middle class,0.08479042
but like better you know also the title the movie us could quite literally mean,0.07284404
us also the charity that has talked about a lot in the film Hands Across,0.054485757
America is you know commentary on the charities and things that are ineffective in the,0.2730068
United States that are there for homelessness but Hands Across America was actually a real,0.13885339
charity that was attempted and failed pretty much a lot of the donations and things,0.098971546
didn't end up going to the homeless because they had a lot of overhead costs,0.039404374
and stuff so it ended up not being beneficial to the lower class or homelessness,0.2550092
in America I really loved that social commentary that's something that's definitely important and a,0.036096048
huge issue but I'm really happy he went this route with dealing with the lower-class,0.15211
and representing them in the movie and using certain symbolism to show that they were,0.09755026
lower-class apparently the lower-class don't have eyebrows so but you know their appearance is a,0.14914665
whole part of them being the lower class in that thing look kind of more,0.19293201
sickly because the lower-class in America doesn't have the best access to health care let's,0.52842426
go ahead and talk about the big twist the reveal in the end that red,0.09027211
is actually the real Adelaide when she wandered off as a little girl at the,0.24075717
fair and she ran into her untethered down below was strangled the untethered actually switched,0.2601855
places with her and now they lived above ground and forced the real Adelaide to,0.11473973
live underground with the untether to me this is horrifying in so many ways like,0.24100423
I just could not stop thinking about the fact that this real human child grew,0.28795597
up for like what 20 30 years underground I don't know how old she is,0.24026768
but she has two kids grew up in this underground area that's totally uncomfortable they,0.11152005
ate raw rabbits they had to mimic the people that they were tethered to on,0.26056388
the ground I don't know above that for that long though she I mean that's,0.117457286
like a new kind of torture am i right and then when you learn that,0.50076634
and you think back to when she is like talking to who we think is,0.14351407
the real Adelaide and her voice which will get into her voice because I don't,0.26306638
know why they're serious about it it's obvious but we'll get into the voice but,0.052470833
she's like talking to her saying like well you got food I had a raw,0.31089434
rabbits and you got toys and I had to play with sharp shiny things and,0.11937233
it's just so in hindsight that twist to me seems so obvious anyone else I,0.11743091
don't know if anyone caught it I didn't catch it at all I don't know,0.076662496
why because looking back it's like oh obviously that happened like that of course that,0.0785005
would be a plot point in this story but I didn't catch it so was,0.03589364
it successful you tell me did you catch it before they revealed it Jordan Peele,0.112065636
embedded so many things into the movie that was supposed to lead us to this,0.07490681
revelation you know she only drinks water she's eating strawberries while her family is eating,0.1502133
chicken her friend offers her a rose a and she's like I'm good with water,0.27198875
she only drinks water Pepe what do you do and there's these little moments that,0.09649836
you back and realize that Jordan Peele was telling this to us all along there's,0.06585219
theories out there that people believe that Jason which is the boy is also had,0.07107848
also switched with his tethered and he and they have like evidence behind it I,0.22787368
just don't believe that theory if it is true it's definitely not as obvious as,0.074412584
red and Adelaide is I think it's been confirmed or anything but I just I,0.105004005
don't believe that theory personally so the next thing I want to talk about is,0.071179576
her voice and I wasn't really gonna get into this other than mentioning it was,0.24222612
fantastic and as soon as she started talking I got goose bumps like I got,0.1741659
chills because I was scared like I could not imagine that in real life and,0.12582237
I saw some discussion actually on Twitter of what causes her to talk like this,0.1151173
which I thought was obvious but some believe that they're not used to breathing the,0.12663694
air above ground but if that was the case then other people could talk there's,0.07300528
a reason why only red can talk and then some other people said that her,0.11572446
voice is like that because she was strangled as a child realistically the real tethered,0.5803481
people don't have a voice which is a symbol of the lower-class not having a,0.15447147
voice in America and that's you know done on purpose there's a reason why she,0.081432156
can talk it's because she's actually a real human that was switched with her tethered,0.19459563
long ago and she has not been able to use her boys or hasn't you,0.21363722
know no one else she's surrounded by uses their voice so she's not communicating like,0.1574989
you would in the real world also there's the fact that Lupita and the yong-go,0.15137234
mimicked her voice to create this like scary voice she mimicked dysphonia which is a,0.40312418
brain disorder that causes speech to become like that which tells me it's more accurate,0.32916534
that she had just not used her voice for so long instead of being strangled,0.5513486
because I feel like if it was about her being strangled she wouldn't have mimicked,0.3180983
a brain disorder okay now that I've raved about this movie for so long and,0.4344486
talked to old about about the theories can I talk today did you hear that,0.04653408
I'm gonna get into a couple things that I didn't like about the movie which,0.120040104
isn't a lot but I did find some things that I just didn't like about,0.05551648
it so to start the very first frame of the and the very last frame,0.06975279
of the movie I could have done completely without the first frame is actually text,0.085207164
explaining that there are miles of unused tunnels across America and now I feel like,0.061602905
this is added to explain to the viewer that this is happening all over America,0.086310886
and so we understand it not just California and Santa Cruz it is all over,0.107623965
the United States what if you figure out the deeper meaning of the social commentary,0.09110643
aspect of this movie though you understand that it's about all of America it's not,0.14764294
just California I think that's obvious please don't he's being so rambunctious right now when,0.2411586
I'm trying to film a video to me it's just obvious that it's nationwide because,0.08983552
homelessness is an issue nationwide so of course we don't need the tunnel common you,0.24037561
know comment to tell us though it's all over America I don't know why else,0.11964328
that thing would be there it was definitely very confusing that it started off that,0.05384081
way cuz I was like what do you what because then I was anticipating tunnels,0.1251899
did it come out and I'm like okay so it's not a home invasion like,0.15470035
I knew that right off of that because they put this text screen on there,0.07102058
and then on top of that when she goes to the mirror the house of,0.07621672
mirrors situation towards the end you realize oh the tunnels so I wasn't surprised when,0.11298785
she started going down on an escalator where I feel like that scene would have,0.2235424
been so much more powerful and terrifying had I not known it was about tunnels,0.08741858
at all so the very last scene of the film is actually a wide shot,0.09421349
showing the tethered people holding hands there's like a string of people along the mountains,0.18730451
and then he sees some helicopters it was really the helicopters that I didn't like,0.05719826
being there because I feel like it would have been much more of a jarring,0.056611903
image if it was just the tethered because then you don't really know the severity,0.0876697
of the situation but given that there are still people alive in the helicopters and,0.08275428
obviously like are trying to figure out situation to me it kind of takes away,0.114326954
the eeriness and the unsettling ness of the tether taking over because there are still,0.08832573
people alive which of course there are it's still early on it's not like all,0.16853978
of America's dead now and they're the last living family but I still wish we,0.41516867
didn't see the helicopters or even just the last scene although I really liked the,0.061103426
image of them going for like miles that looked like also I really liked the,0.07784967
fact that they killed their tethered by stabbing them with a pair of scissors and,0.7135486
the throat hence taking away their voice kind of in the voice box too you,0.35478598
know because they don't have a voice delete the scissors themselves our symbol because it's,0.10555593
two parts two halves that are symmetrical there's just so much there's so many details,0.07381572
little fine things like that that you can google and look up all of them,0.110473745
the ultimate question is is this better than get out now I hate asking that,0.31089434
because we don't need to compare them they are two individual separate films but we're,0.0800007
gonna compare it like you have to compare them it's his only two movies so,0.15159571
of course you want to know if he's getting better or if he's getting worse,0.2398136
so I'd love to hear what your thoughts are about if it's better then get,0.09234906
out my thoughts yes I think it is better because it can stand alone as,0.11375921
a horror movie and I do believe that us is more of a true horror,0.24913622
movie and get out as kind of more alert I would argue that it's better,0.13539737
than get out and it definitely shows that Jordan Peele is no one-hit wonder I,0.10078032
am so excited that he is coming into the horror community when he is and,0.2436171
doing these social commentary horror movies because I think it's something it's like a whole,0.21728371
new genre and I think it's something the horror community really needed because right now,0.104790114
all we seem to be focused on our remakes sequels and like making movies out,0.11652543
of things that are already done or like books you know like stories that aren't,0.052961733
original there aren't a lot of original horror movies coming out lately there's a handful,0.1498033
of course you could argue that there's a handful here and there but we are,0.061025824
in the era of remakes so to see these original ideas come forth and be,0.07363686
done really well I think is so exciting and I can't wait for Twilight Zone,0.102250606
and to see what he does with that so of course I want this to,0.07164103
be more of a conversation between you and I and you and all of you,0.25947136
together I want to hear your thoughts I know some people didn't like this film,0.2410602
which is hard to believe for me because I loved the movie so much -,0.0830723
the issues I had that that goes with any movie so I want to hear,0.07487782
your thoughts if you didn't like it especially I want to know what was it,0.17884277
about it that you just didn't like so leave all that down below I hope,0.4491816
