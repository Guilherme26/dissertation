[Music] The Farewell written and directed by Lulu Wang takes place primarily in China where a family is visiting the matriarch of the family 9i the family is going to visit 9i because she's been recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer but the family agrees that it's best not to tell her that 9i doesn't know she's sick she thinks that her family is visiting her because of a family wedding which she's taken the liberty of planning as each family member tries to enjoy the remaining time with 9i they also hope to spare her from the truth all right so I've been really looking forward to seeing the farewell for a while now I've seen the film be praised pretty much everywhere and I've been like constantly checking my local theater to see if they're actually playing it at some point since I live in a smaller area sometimes 8:24 films don't come to my area right away it's actually usually what happens and that happened with the farewell as well I mean it took quite a while to actually get here regardless I went in with high expectations and I have to say that I believe those expectations were met for the most part I think that the farewell is definitely a must-see primarily because it touches on a lot of important topics such as tradition family personal identity and a lot of other things along those lines but you could also argue that it's just a must-see because it's just a well made film with the compelling story either way you slice it the farewell is an experience that's worth your time and money because it's emotionally impactful the film was primarily seen through the perspective of awkwafina's character Billy Billy is in an interesting position because she's lived most of her life in America so her beliefs and customs more so aligned with American culture more so than they do with Chinese culture she can't quite wrap her head around why the family believes they need to lie to 9i about you know her terminal lung cancer condition in America most families would never think of doing something like this and there's even a point in the film where the characters discuss how you know in America they wouldn't do something like this and how it would actually be considered illegal in America at least in the film the characters believe that Chinese culture is to you know spare their loved one from the truth so they don't fear their inevitable death at the hands of you know their terminal condition it's very almost heartbreaking to watch the characters hold true to this cultural tradition while they have to internalize and live with the fact that they're not only lying to their beloved family member but that their time with is very short as the movie progresses you see the characters struggling more and more with the lying and coming to terms with the fact that they're almost about to lose a loved one one that they hold very dear to their heart and there's an unsettling feeling you get because you and the characters all know an important piece of information that one of the other important characters doesn't and that results in each scene feeling a bit tense and with significant weight to it The Farewell also discusses culture and tradition insightfully Billy is Americanized in many ways and she is often challenging the idea that 9'i needs to be spared from the truth and I like to have the film focuses on how culture can dictate what our ethics are and our overall decision-making what is deemed normal varies from culture to culture and some traditions may even appear cruel to those on the outside looking in one of the best parts of the film is the way the characters have to you know grapple with upholding tradition and what they feel is inherently right this is a constant struggle for them and it really is kind of tough to watch but in an entertaining kind of way through and through the farewell is awesomely performed I mean every character has their moments but as I mentioned Billy is the perspective through which the viewer understands the story I think aquafina deserves to be an Oscar conversation I think that ultimately she will become February she does a really great job of showing the toll that this whole dilemma is taking on her without actually breaking the wishes and respects of the family by outright telling 9 I the truth so there's a sweet spot that Aquafina finds because her character is able to show various levels of vulnerability based on who is around term there's another interesting theme discussed in the film many of the characters attempt to uphold a cultural standard that focuses on strength and sometimes not asking for help or omitting fears and weaknesses this manifests itself and some of the characters behaviors and they ultimately suffer anxiety from their issues that they just you know suck up and deal with rather than asking for help but from a technical perspective there's two things I love about the fair well in addition to what I've already mentioned I love how the film is shot and I love the music the cinematography gives the film a unique visual style because there's something just off about it but in an appealing kind of way many of the shots are static a lot of them have characters in the frame with a lot of headroom and the visuals help make the film feel off balance which is how the main character Billy feels for most of the film the music also helps establish an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're experiencing something uniquely cultural and different than what most of us Americans are used to the music helps create an atmosphere that transports you somewhere else and it also helps make those emotional beats hit that much harder there's really only one area where I feel like the farewell let me down I mean you could argue that it is a slow film but I think the payoff you get in the final act remedies that issue a bit my problem is that I didn't love the second ending I feel like there are two endings to this film and the final one feels like it almost goes against what the first one did and also the weight of the story I mean the filmmakers didn't have much of a choice and you'll see what I'm talking about once you see it but it kind of diminished the impact for me just a little bit but overall I really enjoyed the farewell I think it's one of the best movies of the year and definitely worth the watch as for the pros cons for the pros I think the characters and performances are awesome the film insightfully discusses a lot of important ideas and themes the cinematography and music are awesome and the emotion / fields are definitely there as for the cons I'd say just a second ending exists for a reason but I feel it does contradict the first ending just a bit I'm gonna give the farewell a 9.5 out of 10 and definitely recommend you check it out in theaters if you're looking for a well-made drama film this is the one for you so did you guys see the farewell yet what did you think of it and if not let me know why not also let me know your favorite movie of 2019 thus far for me John wick 3 is still holding the top spot but there's so obviously some time for it to be dethroned if possible either way this is wolf fox if occation signing off see you in the next review [Music]
