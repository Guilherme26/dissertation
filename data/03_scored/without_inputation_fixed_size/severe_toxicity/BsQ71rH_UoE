hey everyone iron stuff Koza and welcome back to my channel today I am reviewing,0.026120432
a movie called eighth grade eighth grade was written and directed by Bo Burnham who,0.052292082
is most famously known as a comedian and an internet personality he's done a little,0.09446871
bit of acting but this is his directorial debut and I was very very excited,0.063101314
for this movie because I personally loved Bo Burnham I am a huge fan of,0.036736097
all of his comedy that he's ever done I remember watching him when he first,0.07204005
came out on YouTube and he was just like this little youtuber singing songs in,0.22406639
his bedroom he's also super young he's three years younger than me which kind of,0.0893907
makes me feel like cuz I'm like what am I doing with my life he's,0.14047748
already directed this first movie and I'm just sitting here in my shitty apartment filming,0.4999177
a YouTube video we can't all be superstars I guess but that's not the point,0.04763779
of this video the point of this video is to review this amazing movie also,0.09042241
sorry if the lighting in this video was like super dramatic there's like weird shadows,0.08692554
going on my light stand is not being my friend and I just have a,0.041595265
light on the floor going for a new cinematic video style today but anyways 8th,0.04258905
grade focus Steph let's go eighth grade is a movie about exactly what it sounds,0.023668565
like it's about eighth grade it's about the feeling experience the shittiness of being an,0.26365286
8th grader and just going into this I think that's kind of a great concept,0.08332024
for a movie because every time there's like a coming-of-age story or like a movie,0.027710885
about young people it's always like teenagers like high school or like way way yeah,0.057058122
like really little it's always this like high school coming-of-age story where you've already gone,0.086763225
through puberty maybe you're still going through it but you've like gotten over the really,0.057861663
terrible parts and it's almost like glorifying this young innocence and this like kind of,0.0937583
polished coming-of-age perspective but no one ever talks about that shitty shitty 8th grade nobody,0.80814576
ever looks back on their life and is like you know what 8th grade was,0.060778495
the best year of my life nobody in the history of the human race has,0.14438875
ever said that ever once not once eighth grade is when you're just like you,0.11236481
have acne you're like in the middle of puberty or like you're like in this,0.13343585
weird in-between phase of like I'm not really a kid but I'm not really like,0.033058297
a teenager quite yet you might be like 30 but even that is like you,0.051665477
don't really count your also at the very end of middle school which is the,0.049983896
worst years of anyone's life is middle school you're in the middle you're not young,0.12673678
you're not in elementary school you're not old enough to be at high school you're,0.21663767
just in this weird stupid limbo of not knowing who the you are so that's,0.43428412
what this movie is about sorry if I just went on a rant about how,0.03672745
much I hated eighth grade it's just the worst that's the point no one ever,0.1144801
talks about it no one ever glorifies it no one ever puts the spotlight on,0.044734266
it and that's what this movie does it's like hey remember eighth grade you probably,0.039330315
don't but now you will and that was something that I really appreciated about this,0.03044346
movie is it was forcing me to remember a time that I really don't ever,0.02551445
want to think about ever and it's also a time that personally I just like,0.017129144
pushed so far out of my mind that I don't even really remember it that,0.04329747
much but watching this movie brought it back so much and it was so real,0.03773387
and so intense basically let's let's talk about the actual movie and what it is,0.017605416
so this movie is about a girl a young girl in eighth grade she's very,0.13311921
shy she doesn't really have any friends at all she just lives with her dad,0.08510493
her mom is out of the picture it's just her her dad who's kind of,0.28475875
this goofy detached trying to understand his daughter but really can't because she's in eighth,0.3251593
grade and she's like get the away from me dad and that alone really shows,0.04630676
this very like eighth grade mentality of feeling super alone and feeling like your parents,0.0967483
don't understand you you can't even talk to your dad you don't really have any,0.07635909
friends you just feel super alone nobody understands me why that sort of thing and,0.04615709
it's kind of annoying like you kind of are annoyed by her like you don't,0.23151702
really like her which is weird to have a protagonist where you you don't really,0.061387137
like the protagonist you watch her and you're like oh stop but I'm not really,0.03114656
mad about it because nobody likes an eighth-grader sorry I would not be friends with,0.09833875
me when I was in eighth grade I was probably the worst everyone in eighth,0.09040312
grade is the worst in this movie captures that so well and it also captures,0.09505075
this eighth grade in a modern society so like the Internet is just like taken,0.16541255
over the world everyone cares about their online personalities and this girl this eighth-grade girl,0.22109574
she doesn't have any friends but she wants to be popular she wants to be,0.048281025
seen everyone has an Instagram they put their whole lives on it they just want,0.06458667
it they want an audience everybody wants an audience so she wants an audience so,0.022968126
she's like spends all of her time on snapchat and on Instagram and on YouTube,0.2977812
she has a YouTube channel where she posts videos that we kind of see the,0.096730344
vlog style video of her giving life advice and life tips and it's kind of,0.08108988
ironic because it's like her giving advice on things that she actually knows nothing about,0.04125868
so like she's this really shy awkward eighth-grade girl and she's trying to give advice,0.14848429
to people about how to not be a shy awkward eighth-grade girl so it's just,0.26555026
kind of this cool perspective of like young people needing attention on the Internet and,0.039160028
while it is shown in a very modern way I feel like it's still relatable,0.031880256
at least for me because social media was still a thing when I was a,0.01753025
kid sort of need my space but it's that feeling of isolation and just craving,0.08146903
attention and like wanting people to like you so the movie is not like super,0.05972285
plot driven it's more just like a snapshot of this girl's life and we're just,0.26206115
kind of seeing her in the middle of eighth grade we kind of follow her,0.05078145
through the year and just like watch her suffer through this terribly awkward time I,0.24636886
do think this is one of those movies where if you don't relate to her,0.026302027
you probably won't enjoy it just because it is it's very slow the pacing is,0.032007974
it drags a lot which part of me feels like it's kind of necessary because,0.096387774
it's like this is a boring shitty time in this girl's life and it should,0.7464959
kind of drag but there were other times where I was like okay let's go,0.12440065
come on but I think it was like a stylistic choice to do it that,0.049777023
way so I don't know you might like it I had a little bit of,0.060119964
trouble with it but I think the only thing really keeping me in there was,0.06663544
that it was so relatable to me painfully relatable like there were moments in this,0.06435385
movie where she would say something or do something or be in some situation that,0.027417539
was so painfully relatable like I have 100% been in that exact place doing that,0.08157879
exact thing and I was like wow that sucked so much there's a lot of,0.5637979
that in this movie so if you were like a shy awkward 8th grader overcome,0.29386127
with anxiety all the time then you will 100% relate to this movie I don't,0.01383715
know if you will like it but you will at least relate to it and,0.01917924
that's another thing I feel like this movie had a lot of like wow that's,0.024977647
me oh my god me same moments but that doesn't really necessarily make it a,0.016724713
good movie like it did a good job portraying those emotions and those feelings but,0.033186678
the movie itself as a whole was pretty good not the best thing I've ever,0.07475999
seen personally I think the edge of 17 while yes that is about a 17,0.018747536
year old and not an eighth grader very different still have very similar concepts and,0.06842411
I think that one did a much better job of capturing that story in like,0.02044841
a good movie with a solid plot this one is a little more loose it's,0.06457537
a little less of a like beginning middle end and more of a like here's,0.03853941
a chunk of this girl's life that sucks here yeah and I think another problem,0.68184793
that I had was just that she was just the worst I was like please,0.15433657
stop talking I want to murder you but it was interesting and it was a,0.6806774
cool thing to see and to think about and to see how social media is,0.014220296
warping young people's lives like that was actually just really concerning to see I was,0.06726603
like wow this is like a real thing that is happening to young people and,0.05871709
older people basically everyone everyone wants an audience all the time and that's what this,0.030505322
movie is also showing us and it's just like uh and I'm a hypocrite because,0.11313178
Here I am I'm sitting here talking to you on the Internet about a movie,0.036231223
that you could just go see and find out for yourself but instead you're here,0.070482194
listening to me so just having an existential crisis right now it's fine don't worry,0.04970452
about it let's move on so yeah eighth grade I liked it it made me,0.055246163
cry like a little girl it was very well shot very beautifully done very very,0.41214675
real one of those movies that every character feels incredibly real no one is like,0.0239812
polished there's not a lot of like makeup like you see people being human beings,0.32931432
in a very realistic setting which I do really appreciate especially for something like this,0.030269846
because it's 100% necessary I had a couple problems with the pacing a couple issues,0.02399783
with the plot not really feeling whole like it just sort of ends and you're,0.03836979
like okay I kind of got something from this but like it was missing something,0.048256412
but I will say this is a beautiful snapshot of what it is like to,0.04265956
be an awkward antisocial confused 8th grader it completely captures the feeling of needing to,0.11938051
be liked and wanting people to love you but also feeling completely afraid of everyone,0.015077053
and I think it also kind of makes you think about this wall that we,0.027069649
have between us and the world which is the internet so there's like us when,0.025874313
we put ourselves on the internet and the world sees it but it's kind of,0.030759422
this weird indirect thing I'm probably not gonna go stand up at a podium in,0.05192224
front of millions of people and talk to them the way I'm talking to you,0.08057635
right now but that's kind of what I'm doing but there's this wall that's like,0.036376234
my camera screen and the internet wall where it's like you're kind of over there,0.054483198
so it's not that scary and I think there's this weird disillusion where people don't,0.14162758
realize that that's actually what they're doing and I don't even realize it sometimes I,0.034137223
feel like nobody who puts themselves on the Internet really realizes how open that is,0.03444321
and how literally anyone in the whole world can see it and that is how,0.027313106
they're gonna perceive you and you could just be a total lie but nobody knows,0.1247645
because that's all I see this could get into a whole other huge rant about,0.08579339
internet culture and social media and I'm just gonna stop right there and get this,0.038848054
movie rating so I think 8th grade is a very impressive directorial debut from Bo,0.052292746
Burnham I was very impressed I was a little worried because like oh you're a,0.04657749
great comedian but like can you make a movie I don't know but I think,0.064282015
he can and I would see something that he makes again in the future if,0.04237486
he does that but considering the problems I mentioned it's not like a perfect movie,0.0470511
I think I'm gonna give it a 3.5 reading seems pretty good to me made,0.017588787
me feel a lot of things made me made me feel some of the stuffs,0.10690433
and things and stuff a lot of tears came out of this yeah okay that's,0.08435593
