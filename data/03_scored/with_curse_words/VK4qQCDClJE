the Klu Klux Klan but they send his partner a white police officer in as,0.46090505
him so he is playing all the parts of the Klan member when they talk,0.22353344
to him on the phone but the other officer is the guy in person what,0.09331825
are you guys doing a story a super smart story lesson in history and obviously,0.10526482
on what's going on in present time mixed with comedy and real-life issues this story,0.097657405
bands I love it I think this story is just okay Jan I'm saying that,0.070326865
the general story like the story's good Jan I'm saying the story's good that this,0.044761214
platinum black african-american I don't know depending on where you are where the african-american officer,0.6722409
infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan I think that part miss lit the part where they,0.2633842
send in his partner also live there's other things in the story that I thought,0.085314244
I could have been way better but the general story of it is good I'm,0.051062137
gonna say originals I'm noticing about this before as well so yeah true story that,0.09017606
this guy is a rookie almost trying to prove himself and he kind of story,0.40322933
goes for something something like dangerous being african-american and then lucky saying he's bringing up,0.7217257
these guys and he's like I can't go so I'm gonna send my partner who,0.35718128
is dead also like Jewish the Ku Klux kind of also kind of hey he's,0.48655367
also kind of messed up hopefully like there's so many that confliction said so much,0.15048842
can go wrong but yeah you know go through the ties and stuff before that,0.10190992
was an interesting story no it's definitely a conflict of races and when I say,0.27543885
grace I'm just talking about skin color cuz we're all the same human beings but,0.48555538
it is just I like how the story puts in perspective these like watching the,0.058652487
story you know black white Jewish but then it's like you know two of them,0.556984
are kinda in the same pathway but in society it's gone a lot seemed that,0.07014213
way and even that Cara consult don't say that so I think that's really the,0.062419217
way they put it in a story with it decently decent so guys acting-wise used,0.0769723
to do do jeans down so much what you guys drink for me Adam Drybar,0.1525345
kylo Ren them so I feel like Adam driver it's a super legit in this,0.10748551
movie John David Washington who the main character is as well both of these two,0.07148868
I just love the dynamic how they bounce off each other the it's like just,0.24536994
just the chemistry between them is is it's interesting because it's like you know they're,0.05872893
on the same team but like one's putting his life at risk to satisfy the,0.115991905
other ones need to I don't know what to express himself or to to that,0.09609004
to fight his crusade you know I'm saying I well Adam drivers characters like not,0.13286808
feeling as emotionally tied to it as he should my issue that position yeah I've,0.14016236
got a jump on that as well because I think that's that's that's the real,0.13312957
balance of things about this movies that we all go in with the expectation discount,0.05415872
has been main thing would be obviously about this black guy but then he's not,0.66542685
the one like I said inside in that scenario you know in the midst of,0.082394294
of the KKK so and other drivers character finds himself and it kind of reveals,0.11096253
like who really is which he kind of like was brought there by a meaning,0.08186821
not that it was his fault but he was just because of his upbringing and,0.24101421
he's like oh like well this is bigger than that for you know he's not,0.14499323
only your Crusades over a smile as long as some so protected so I really,0.19308005
think those two character waste like you said down the way they've bounced him looks,0.35733882
really great yeah I do also like a David John David Washington and Adam driver,0.10362497
Jackson but I damn sure don't know how this movie would be carried on is,0.5154597
other actors who stood out and play their part well no see that kind of,0.06817575
hate enforcement kind of guessing that they did their part yeah definitely like the main,0.2785726
office not I mean officer that the chief of the whole Police Department he was,0.07918918
an nlgger from the beginning you kind of know what he's trying to do they,0.33833534
like are you something oh you know I like the Ku Klux Klan he was,0.34924302
kind of being a dick about everything yeah yeah I kind of like the way,0.8785311
who's know what I can read his current from buddies almost like a fool everyone,0.7827156
was almost like that on that side of the team but then not like the,0.07526523
way he's firing his calls he's like going some - about it but usually like,0.24168885
this kind of but you know that's how you know for ya David Dunn what's,0.08226613
your driver like them too like he goes what he said like with chemistry carry,0.14926748
the movie good acting yeah I think it's fair to say that also created to,0.091581024
to the gas on opposite team because they acting made me feel some type of,0.20355216
words on which just shows the way they deliver death their side of it so,0.3424016
you know I like the production is a level of this movie I like how,0.08271731
there were some scenes shot dutifully the contrast between two stories you know who is,0.08317335
basically who's saying what to WHO so basically the audience know you're talking to and,0.11552921
there are some specific scenes very very powerful things that actually goes on today but,0.04158768
then I also feel that the what they've implemented in which is the history of,0.034620937
what as you know African Americans as you would say have gone through and what,0.5327375
they've implemented into kind of like educate a new generation because I thought that some,0.09136399
things they would sit would have said some people with a picture but for others,0.10696146
who are not so up they're not from that generation you just find in that,0.15179367
name you know would satisfy you know you wouldn't really gave just you know we,0.07066796
just wouldn't do anything really so having certain images and scenes really really great and,0.08914984
seen oh my goodness breathtaking yeah I think he was just mainly about showing what's,0.08627645
going on in the world and how we've been having this conflict for god knows,0.14891092
how long production-wise i feel like as a whole it was alright i thought that,0.078713834
there was some really epic scenes i feel like there was some really scenes that,0.048407476
kind of took me out in the movie as well so i call that production,0.095928945
cut me might be like one of the downfalls of the movie I thought like,0.2361192
overall it was okay she let me say I feel like there was definitely some,0.109670416
scenes that I was like don't need this don't need that but they were also,0.12963533
superseded by some scenes of and laziness where I'm like this is so sick I,0.38995528
wish there was more of this do not save so in any kind of balance,0.079316735
that I saw but I just thought like this this is probably the only everyone,0.0719836
thought that this movie could have done that was when like major high and it,0.06567549
went super low they gave us a in way is is facing the basically they're,0.07865153
saying so like it was right everything felt like he was in place even the,0.104193285
way was like the looks or the way was sure felt like it was a,0.07334545
whole new destroying those kind of times everything saying those cool but there was some,0.2455887
shots that were big wave minute when he don't playing some scenes I was like,0.13842535
that wasn't made the key for you to do that movie it's a movie that,0.09525292
everybody must watch especially because what was going on the world it's very very fun,0.07800009
a funny movie but at the same time with serious issues and obviously something that,0.0925003
you can we all as you know you would be as we joke about by,0.24107511
the same time is soon as so it's just an aspect of just being human,0.21450216
being you know with every comedy has you know truth to it I think the,0.10428632
movies really good I really like here I thought like it's lacking the level of,0.15058596
depth that I thought I was gonna get with the movie especially it being a,0.065826446
spy TV movie I thought like it was gonna go a bit deeper but it,0.15018237
didn't but even with that lack of depth is still really good moving I do,0.09862707
think that like hey watch it watch it cause in the crime of what we,0.12809463
live in today while I like about the movie is the way showed you one,0.08824645
side or what people were preaching in the other side of what people were experiencing,0.08351711
I can sum you don't really get up too often and they reached on this,0.0976292
wall especially in certain scenes where you saying one person will be doing this and,0.064706296
that and it's kind of conflicted whatever people or people who are doing it another,0.08972494
scene and that goes to show her what the movies trying to portray and like,0.07450109
it really just I'm from in this kind of movie but some that this is,0.05882787
a direction a little bit didn't we missed you all the whole movie like wasn't,0.10164097
Reagan it's a for me oh my gosh the TCA official rating for this movie,0.12122484
black can't even gets a full sofas if let movie guys let us know in,0.5979454
the comments down below what you think what the movie is that lit for you,0.21507414
broken sofa is it dead legit we want to know I'm sorry mister blitzed and,0.43831208
