hello and welcome back to the next step of classic film reviews,0.07907756
this is a film that I've loved I've watched it several times and I continue to enjoy it every time I see it everyone I've spoken to about this film is it's a film that they've loved as well,0.06496706
and I expect it's a film that you're really going to enjoy also it is the third man from 1949 as if in music from Anton Karras an Austrian musician is really central it's an important part of the opening theme,0.19360857
and it permeates through the rest of the film the look of this film was really engaging as well it's the first British production to use extensive location shooting,0.1253707
it was also the first British film and started to try and create the neorealistic style of directors like Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini now Reed actually had three film units on this particular shoot there was a daytime unit there was a nighttime unit,0.026691675
and interestingly there was a silly unit now he oversaw all three of those particular film units which meant,0.39525574
he was sometimes working up to about 20 hours a day it showed how much he cared about this film and how much he exerted his control over how it was made,0.11590482
and I think the results speak for themselves,0.06387132
Reid was keen to give the film a very local feel beyond the location shooting he'd used lots of locals in key extras roles,0.14946677
you'll see in some key scenes that balloon seller,0.104806975
he was a local from Vienna police officers with Vienna sewer unit so they were quite accustomed to working in those particular parts of the city,0.0959157
and the fire department played a really important role as well you'll notice a number of the nighttime scenes the cobblestones the sidewalks the streets are wet Carol reused his lighting and the reflection off those streets to really bring those nighttime scenes to life,0.10439299
so all these people played a really important role in the look with a film and making it look as authentic as it actually is the other important aspect of this film is the symbolism very early in the film Holly Martin's played by Joseph Cotten walks under a ladder without hesitating,0.06898386
it's a foreboding scene in which you sense that he's going to have no luck during the rest of the film during a lot of key scenes in the film Carol Reed uses what's what is called,0.10200532
Dutch angles so framing the shot in a way where things don't look square they look off-kilter a little bit and that gives us a sense of unease that things,0.1693457
aren't as they seem equally with all the nighttime shooting and the shooting in the sewers there's lots of shadows,0.24103425
and and and things are moving in ways where we can't be certain,0.083271764
what's actually happening,0.05499346
again that underlines,0.069589205
the fact that I start as the story goes we're not entirely certain what's happening at all times over,0.050532553
now this is also a great story,0.027098445
it was written by Graham Greene,0.08517848
it was the only original screenplay,0.07039171
he ever wrote he was sent to Vienna in 1948 by one of the other producers Alexander Korda he wanted him to get a sense of the city and and build a story for him around that,0.068703316
now Greene did a number of tours around the city including the sewers some of the city and Nights plots,0.05423056
he spoke to a lot of people,0.070546575
and he got an understanding of how the black market worked in Vienna as well and he incorporated a lot of those elements into the story,0.083905704
he also wrote a story which it was incredibly well structured,0.09854883
it seems to be to me a story in two parts,0.11955763
we start out thinking we're dealing with the murder mystery and then transitions into a crime drama again during the course of the storytelling more and more as a real bet each of the characters that none of them are what they seem and as a result we don't know who to trust we don't know he did who to cheer for in a lot of ways,0.16359313
we don't know necessarily,0.1035569
how things are going to turn out,0.10858523
the central character is Holly Martin's played by Joseph cotton cotton was an actor who began his time in film with working with Orson Welles with his mercury players,0.066824004
he appeared in amazing films like Citizen Kane and the Magnificent Ambersons,0.12336798
and interestingly this is the first film that he also appeared in with Orson Welles since making the Magnificent Ambersons Orson Welles of the is the other central character of the story and despite his importance in the story he doesn't appear for very long,0.046507988
he's only there for five minutes of actual screen time was only there for a week of the shoot he refused to do any of the scenes in the sewer and as a result a lot of those scenes were recreated back in England on a set for those scenes that were shot in the sewer,0.28436822
he was played by a body double wells his greatest contribution to this particular film is his cuckoo-clock monologue,0.32656264
it's very famous,0.06870099
it's one of the key elements of the film and again let's pause for a moment just to listen to that Natalie for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare terror murder and bloodshed but they produced Michelangelo Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance in Switzerland they had brotherly love at 500 years of democracy and peace and what did that produce the cuckoo clock so long Howard this was the most popular film in the UK in 1949,0.21126613
he didn't however attract the same box office in the in Vienna however its reputation,0.07617835
and its popularity has grown over time,0.07668327
it's a film that currently spends three times a week,0.09095966
in the Pokeno cine the older cinema in Vienna the Sun was rated as the number one British film of all time by the British Film Institute it's also ranked as the 57th best American film have made by the American Film Institute now it was a British American co-production,0.012714776
but as we know everyone loves a winner and everyone wants to claim a great film,0.05798471
and this is a great film film reviewer Roger Ebert for him this is his favorite film and film director Martin Scorsese when he was at film school he wrote his major thesis on it he got a B+ for it and his tutor felt that this wasn't a very important film Martin respectfully chose to disagree,0.06754715
now in addition to the great cuckoo clock monologue the other great thing about this film is its ending,0.21349572
it is one of the great endings in cinema history,0.045357376
graham greene wanted the film to have a happy ending which was unusual for him whereas producers David Selznick and director Carol Reed wanted a sad ending,0.0747499
I'm not going to tell you which way the film went I'm going to encourage you to watch it yourself however read in particular felt insecure about the length of that final sequence it runs close to two minutes,0.09934722
but again it's masterful,0.057022575
and it is one of the great moments in cinema history,0.031372156
so as always I'd encourage you to watch this particular film you'll find a link on our website to it,0.15164904
and I also encourage you to once you've seen the film leave some comments at the bottom let us know what you think,0.07321766
and then hopefully we'll see you again,0.10809564
