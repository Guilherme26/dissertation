with the monsters University at was a little bit different I think maybe but most,0.06219667
Pixar movies i leave the Pixar movie and I really have a lot to think,0.0419977
about that I think that's definitely one of those movies there's a scene in this,0.026252137
movie that is just really really stuck with me I mean I wrote in a,0.031479817
min a day but it really struck me and I can't wait to watch the,0.06382371
movie again when it comes on blu-ray so yeah I'm definitely all for this movie,0.027912436
I liked that I had a lot of thing for efforts but any nice get,0.030776717
on to what the movies about so basically we have a little girl called Riley,0.08583596
she's 11 in this movie I knew she was mom and dad she's only child,0.13847262
and basically they move from I think Minnesota to San Francisco I think it's Minnesota,0.053704932
than before I didn't move to San Francisco and obviously you know she's got to,0.01544756
leave friends behind and she's got to go to a new school and she's got,0.12085788
to leave her hockey team behind which he loves and all this stuff and she's,0.061240796
kind of it's basically I've got the outside situation and then most of the story,0.019457286
goes on with inside her head I'm sure you probably all know this I mean,0.27278697
who doesn't know what inside-out us about yet but anyway we have the emotions inside,0.04636463
the head which we have joy sadness disgust anger and fear is there any more,0.13895486
joy sadness disgust anger and fear I think it's fat if ya know I said,0.29459587
yeah and my favorite emotion was definitely sadness and I was really happy about how,0.026373867
much she was actually in this movie at first I already had two felt like,0.036962926
she was my favorite before was in the movie I was all excited for the,0.030728158
movie I decided her like I played the little app on my phone which is,0.0414895
actually really cool he hadn't played inside our app I'd recommend it's fun and yeah,0.058993142
played the app and I've like sadness and I loved her in this movie chef,0.03125964
that didn't disappoint me i think my second favorite character was probably joy she's kind,0.065298416
of our main character because basically you know inside this headquarters where all these emotions,0.0490094
are droids kind of in charge she's kind of wanting to keep Riley happy obviously,0.08729404
you know and the others kind just bit in every now and then I'm see,0.06768044
a joy I really liked as well now we also have a few moments but,0.020778341
not very many I think maybe I would have personally likes her to be a,0.23124777
few more of these moments cuz i found i'm really funny but I think maybe,0.05403819
kids wouldn't as much but basically it's a few times when we get to inside,0.07071035
the mom and dad's head and I thought that was hilarious i love that i,0.21229003
loved the mom dad's heads I went inside there's I thought that was really funny,0.24187517
those scenes definitely made me laugh the first half of the movie I definitely got,0.05385726
a lot of laughs and I found it funny and it was relatable and it,0.047592558
was cute and it was just it was funny discussed definitely made me laugh a,0.02243598
lot at one point and I was just laughing I haven't really laughed too much,0.016463295
like that in a movie before oh well not before but you know recently and,0.028800456
it was so funny I'm so cute and then the second half of the movie,0.046967287
definitely what I don't want to say sad it was kind of sad but not,0.023154378
in a bad way not sad about it was just kind of that kind of,0.020062603
heart hurting Lee sad but happy kind of thing I'm and it was surprising the,0.038222782
way that it ended was definitely interesting I like the message obviously I can't give,0.022459261
I don't wanna give too much wags if you have this in maybe I definitely,0.19131348
think you should just go and see it and be surprising loved it but if,0.039039627
you have seen you probably know all the things i'm talking about it if you,0.033096876
need to explain it but um yeah there was things that happened i didn't expect,0.01973866
you i could say we have kind of our main characters of joy and sadness,0.050778788
they're kind of the main main 2 i'd say and and the relationship between the,0.034510393
two of them was really really interesting I really loved it and I especially loved,0.04533692
sad this his story that progress throughout the whole film I thought it's fantastic I,0.02194973
loved it I loved the concept of it and the idea and the kind of,0.035764262
message behind the whole story and then we also have another character called Bing bong,0.015085035
and at first I was like being I'm not really gonna tell you who being,0.0517606
wrong is you probably see a picture of him I thought what what is Bing,0.037068687
bong Sao looked him off like what is this and yeah he's actually really really,0.05692309
awesome and he's at first I kind of Italy was a warm to Bing bong,0.2707013
