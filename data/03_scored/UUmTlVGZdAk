singing in the rain so singing in the rain came out in 1952 and has,0.058004446
gathered quite the reputation as being the best movie musical ever made and while i,0.062110886
wouldn't say it's the best it is pretty close singing that rain is just one,0.05902288
of those musicals where every time i watch it i'm blown away by the sheer,0.17535338
amount of talent on and off the screen and it proves that jukebox musicals don't,0.08208647
have to be bad they just most of the time are now for those of,0.1501919
you don't know jukebox musical is a musical where none of the songs are original,0.091575615
they're pre-existing and how it usually goes is that they take a playlist of songs,0.17435004
and then have to retrofit in a story to try to connect them and nine,0.061144084
times out of ten it doesn't work but singing in the rain is the one,0.07451794
time but what is singing in the rain about well it focuses on a period,0.06092364
in history that doesn't often get talked about and that's when hollywood had to transition,0.06672438
from silent cinema to the talkies and that monumental year was 1927 with the jazz,0.026322914
singer the first movie to ever have synchronized dialogue even if it was just for,0.062428646
the musical numbers but more specifically this story focuses on don lockwood played by gene,0.066359706
kelly and he's this silent action hero douglas fairbanks type and it's kind of funny,0.12765385
he's playing this type of character here because ever since i saw gene kelly in,0.1165024
the three musketeers movie i always lumped him in with actors like errol flynn and,0.15384486
tyrone power as these kind of swashbuckling adventurers not knowing of course that he's also,0.18618447
one of the best tap dancers of all time but it's still funny seeing him,0.06338378
play this douglas fairbanks errol flynn type character in singing in the rain and this,0.067312054
is gene kelly's movie through and through he helped direct it he choreographed it and,0.085793294
he is the star of this movie and all of his talents are on full,0.10577917
display here his singing his acting and especially his dancing i'm not exaggerating when i,0.24108805
say that this movie has some of the best tap dancing segments ever put to,0.09337309
film but gene kelly's don lockwood does not carry this movie alone he's also accompanied,0.106205046
with his best friend cosmo brown played by donald o'connor and not only is he,0.22118714
talented enough to hang with gene kelly's choreography he's also the perfect comic for gene,0.48210078
kelly's straight man but their lives are not all sunshine and roses because you've also,0.3987603
got lena lamont played by gene hagen and she is the thorn in the side,0.45492345
of don lockwood this whole movie because she's convinced that she's a lot more talented,0.15433769
than she actually is and doesn't think that her voice is the most annoying thing,0.55517745
on earth for heaven's sake what's the big idea can a girl get a word,0.19530158
in edgewise and what really gets under lockwood's skin is the fact that she's convinced,0.122653954
that he's in love with her and wants to marry her because according to cosmo,0.18911453
she's irresistible she told him so herself but where the plot really gets going is,0.12786199
when don lockwood meets kathy selden played by debbie reynolds and she's an aspiring actress,0.18980613
she wants to go on broadway and she doesn't think too highly of movie actors,0.20094645
but naturally a romance sparks between kathy and don and that of course makes lena,0.07179971
jealous i know that's kind of a bare bones plot but where this movie really,0.135703
excels is one the musical numbers which i'm gonna get to and two how they,0.0837158
tell this other story at the same time of hollywood adapting to this new innovation,0.08076305
called synchronized sound and it's a secondary story that makes singing in the rain so,0.044835504
entertaining as a movie from the very beginning you get the vibe that this movie,0.06031935
doesn't try to accurately depict the 1920s as it was but more of a caricature,0.10510374
of how it felt to be in the 1920s while at the same time poking,0.077454425
fun at all the hypocrisy and just how fake hollywood culture was and still is,0.67339885
and while the clothing and the personalities and the reactions are all very much exaggerated,0.06515993
the motivations are surprisingly authentic you get a good feel of the hesitancy and then,0.09649371
later frustration in trying to use this new talking picture technology and as someone who,0.14938845
loves history especially film history this is all really cool to see but now let's,0.054507785
talk about the part of this movie that actually matters and why it got made,0.062024396
in the first place the musical numbers these musical numbers do not disappoint and the,0.069365084
first big musical number that we get is make them laugh now make them laugh,0.0990393
is important for a couple reasons first of all it's the first non-diegetic song that,0.31089434
we get in this movie being a jukebox musical they usually make most if not,0.08361522
all of the songs non-diegetic i mean just look at mamma mia most of that,0.31089434
movie is just people busting out into song and dance just because they feel like,0.087272674
it but seeing the rain takes a different approach for instance the first few songs,0.03889458
that we get in singing in the rain are diegetic there are performances within the,0.23853905
world that people are reacting to as if they were watching a show and this,0.08681944
makes make them laugh special because it's the first time in this movie where we,0.103327215
see someone break out into song and dance and it's not a paid performance but,0.114127435
the other thing that makes make him laugh special is that it's one of only,0.117225096
two songs that were made specifically for this movie which might disqualify this as a,0.074023716
jukebox musical but make him laugh is so similar to be a clown from the,0.69542736
pirate that i still consider it basically a pre-existing work just one that's copyright friendly,0.18737097
and who can't talk about make him laugh without talking about the a-plus slapstick from,0.37825885
donald o'connor make him laugh as a master class in slapstick all the gags are,0.4452276
there you got pratfalls you haven't getting hit in the head you have pretty much,0.5265967
every form of physical comedy that you can imagine in this one number and it,0.12677282
is fantastic now the next song is you were meant for me and this is,0.0735271
the big love ballad between don lockwood and kathy selden and it's romantic and it's,0.12669519
slow and it's dreamy and everything and it's good but this is where trying to,0.10658481
tell which songs are diegetic and which songs aren't is becoming a little more difficult,0.16689913
because in this song and while i'm thinking about it all the numbers in this,0.0946553
movie are performed by characters who in the world know how to sing and dance,0.08263433
so it's not that big of a stretch when someone just starts expressing themselves in,0.08942445
song and dance when that character is established to be able to sing and dance,0.06564937
and if you need any more proof just look at lena lamont she can't sing,0.11597731
can't dance and she gets zero song and dance numbers in this whole movie so,0.09369193
following that logic i guess you could kind of classify all of these numbers as,0.09732939
diegetic that they do exist in this movie even make them laugh but i still,0.6047328
call them nondiegetic because there's no official established source of the music where it's coming,0.1567535
from so i guess that's where i would draw the line but i don't know,0.084385246
comment below do you think that all the songs in this musical are diegetic and,0.3520777
where do you draw the line let me know but moving on to the next,0.04679372
big number we have my favorite song in the movie and this is the second,0.059865166
and final song written originally for this movie and it's moses supposes and don't ask,0.07954342
me why this is my favorite i have no idea it just really made me,0.067998044
laugh as a kid and still makes me laugh today i just love seeing this,0.1612818
proper british dialect coach just get wrecked by the antics of cosmo and don and,0.4451902
just like all the other numbers in this movie the tap dancing here is insane,0.35971457
it's so fast and with so much energy and man i just i wish i,0.09146607
was that talented and speaking of insane choreography we then go on to good morning,0.16597039
which this is the number where debbie reynold has to hang with the big boys,0.37024525
and she's gone on record saying that she has no dancing experience and she was,0.1528881
basically starting from scratch when the rehearsal started how how can she nail this crazy,0.55201375
choreography with zero experience she found a new talent i guess i mean between her,0.1944296
and dick van dyke maybe more actors should just be thrown into crazy choreography and,0.7927699
see what happens you might get some really good dancers out of it but i,0.14432201
guess it can't be that hard to keep up when you're dressed like quicksilver from,0.18566786
x-men but now we have the big finale climactic musical number broadway melody this is,0.10472218
the one where they threw all the money all the budget all the choreography all,0.08358106
the effects and it makes absolutely no sense and it's actually my least favorite number,0.11598937
in the movie i know a lot of people like it and it is impressive,0.109197155
from a technical perspective but let me explain the whole rest of this movie is,0.059648972
so grounded in the world of the 1920s that it's created for itself and like,0.061543234
i explained earlier with diagesis it doesn't force you to suspend your disbelief so much,0.18205953
because all the characters are actors and dancers and performers so when they perform in,0.049950868
a musical number it's not that weird but all that goes out the window with,0.09131189
broadway melody i know that in the context of the story it's framed where don,0.06884504
lockwood is explaining the broadway melody segment to the producer because that's going to be,0.0439943
the big opening for the movie that they're trying to make within the movie but,0.06763407
even that doesn't really hold up to scrutiny because what we know of the movie,0.034934998
the dancing cavalier so far it doesn't line up to what we're seeing in this,0.115713954
segment sure it starts off similar enough you have a young hoofer who's looking to,0.25366467
star in a broadway show and everything and he's got big dreams but that's really,0.14867455
where it ends we don't see the sandbag hit him on the head we don't,0.5940319
even really see him star in a broadway show we just see this guy get,0.15026194
picked up by an agent and then montage through him you know getting higher up,0.12331345
in the ranks of broadway and then it takes a turn to the speakeasy and,0.09016415
gangsters and gangster life and this woman played by cerise who might be a wizard,0.6364068
of oz type parallel to lena lamont and i don't know it doesn't line up,0.06971662
all that well and it just feels like an excuse to have gene kelly do,0.10230861
his gene kelly thing for 15 to 20 minutes which is way too long by,0.15160038
the way and pardon me feels bad ragging on this segment because it is really,0.14600924
impressive the sets look really cool the coloring the lighting the dancing and choreography it's,0.08040594
all really impressive and looks great but it does nothing to further the rest of,0.04646498
the story which i guess wouldn't hurt so much if i wasn't so invested in,0.053154584
this 1920s drama that was going on because again i love hollywood history but even,0.10457524
so singing and reign is a fantastic musical and it is a testament to what,0.06907028
jukebox musicals can be if they really tried the dancing is incredible the camera work,0.10429937
is great it's shot in long takes where you really get a sense of the,0.4032348
choreography that's on display and all of the actors do a phenomenal job with the,0.07070607
roles that they're given singing and reign is just a classic movie musical that should,0.075656414
be watched time and time again if you've never watched it check it out if,0.0899999
you haven't seen in a while watch it again it's well worth the time but,0.086519636
now i turn over to you guys where do you draw the line of what,0.1044859
is diegetic versus non-diegetic and singing in the rain how much of it is in,0.31384715
universe or just for the audience's benefit i don't know but i'd love to hear,0.074383214
