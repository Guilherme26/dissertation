hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing of a favorite this film came out,0.121964246
in 2018 it was directed by your ghost Don Tomas this film was a bit,0.13661224
of a departure for Lent the most because it was the first film I think,0.07970384
in his filmography that he did not write himself or or co-write his films tend,0.1941503
to be very heavy on abstractions and the stories themselves and the themes are expressed,0.08224764
a lot through metaphors and such and they aren't very literal and of course he,0.14764103
has typically has a very distinct style of dialogue in his movies where the characters,0.095236905
everything kind of goes against the rulebook where his characters really lack dimension and yet,0.09001619
there's something very appealing about that in terms of the way his films work and,0.08297357
he's exploring humans from the outside and a rather cold sort of sterile way rather,0.34493822
than the more cerebral aspects that were used to the dialogue is very exaggerated very,0.24088803
banal and very awkward highlighting kind of the satirical satirical aspects of social norms and,0.16267307
honestly I know a lot of people think that this film is very different from,0.06186339
the rest of his films and that it is a much more straightforward more literal,0.17658629
story where it is kind of focusing more on the characters and their motivations and,0.032672506
the more I guess you could say stereotypical way but honestly I think that at,0.051296264
the heart of it everything is so similar even to his films that do have,0.15876734
that more exaggerated more abstract style with the dialogue I think that it easily translates,0.06741594
into this just in a more subtextual sense to me this film still carries a,0.07934084
lot of the signatures and the things that we know and love about Al anthemic,0.033742957
film this film just like his others is studying behavior and contrasting that between this,0.0971522
kind of careful attention to etiquette and artifice and then contrasting that with just brutality,0.3465904
and then idiocy really and using this particular narrative to highlight all of these ideas,0.7991359
all of these themes we were looking at it depicted as a comedy of manners,0.12306416
or kind of an absurdist piece where the humor especially in the screenplay and the,0.28102946
humor just naturally Atlanta Moses works in terms of his vision I think meshed perfectly,0.11232096
and they translate beautifully to screen film is is gorgeous to look at very immersive,0.098028824
in its style a lot of fisheye lenses a lot of wide-angle lenses and deep,0.06602927
focus all of this to create kind of a richness in a depth but also,0.09154981
something that is slightly off so it sort of eases us into the surrealism because,0.14171925
there is a bit of surrealism and there are a bit of abstractions in this,0.10016428
film but it's very very subtle it's like the dissonance is like this needle that's,0.06106795
just kind of slowly kind of creeping into the film just ever so slightly it,0.15581976
is exquisite of course the set pieces and the costumes and the lighting and everything,0.09016209
does remind me a lot of Barry Lyndon actually just in terms of the the,0.055216577
cinematography but it is picturesque but I would say also in a way very grotesque,0.1842211
almost gothic and it does help to emphasize that weird contradiction that people have between,0.08601457
this sort of ignorance to the things that are really important the things that are,0.40319303
paramount compared to emphasizing what is gratuitous there is a war going on but you,0.15181768
don't really see any of that at all the opulence and the excess is at,0.07488741
the forefront of the film because that is what is more important to these characters,0.063952744
seemingly there at these elegant parties eating these exquisite hors d'oeuvres and yet they they,0.32797766
aren't talking about the matter at hand the the country's well-being and I like the,0.09930502
flow of this film there's a hypnotic quality to it and you sort of through,0.10190432
that you see the elegance highlighted and contrasted with the violence and a lot of,0.20595162
very kind of cheeky very fun ways like watching Abigail and Anne and they're they're,0.24144305
dancing they're doing some sort of dance but you can hear the gunshots in the,0.07375087
background you see Sarah getting dragged through the dirt by her horse after she's been,0.31089434
poisoned by Abigail and that is contrasted or I should say it's cross cut with,0.25078654
this this naked man inside the palace then they're throwing fruit not him in slow,0.55485547
motion and just laughing I also like that they're emphasizing the personal relationships particularly between,0.07955595
the three women rather than the politics whatever decisions you make in politics tend to,0.13860165
come from things that happen internally and behind closed doors and this film really likes,0.0676275
to show you a bit more of what happens behind closed doors and how it,0.17931712
fuels those external aspects of the the characters but also what is most important is,0.039649185
how what happens behind closed doors is used to manipulate people and to bend others,0.12573144
towards your will this film is about women and all they're very complex shades it's,0.20989598
about their strength and their power but also their their duplicity and their scheming and,0.14893007
even at a certain point really resorting to violence there's an injury to the film,0.10181838
you notice particularly in the clothing but with the women you're seeing how all of,0.23338014
those things that sort of blend into different aspects of the emotional spectrum whether it,0.038728353
is through sex or through love through hate or through deceit sex is a huge,0.6650964
component in the film it is used in a myriad of ways when I look,0.057576697
at the character of Sarah played by Rachel Weisz she is somebody I think that,0.040311858
is very loyal and and very blunt to the Queen but she does it of,0.07633893
course out of love because they've known each other so long so she can be,0.18062143
brutally honest with her when she needs to but I think that there's more to,0.3842321
her she's got a real a real strength to her a real sturdy core innocence,0.2040576
that I think she relishes in having power I think that she likes to be,0.22180864
the one making the decisions and sort of condescending a bit to the queen pampering,0.111075476
the queen really she should probably be the one running things she might she should,0.15125896
be the one who is the queen she is the one quite literally when you,0.07914037
look at the costuming she is the one wearing the pants in the relationship so,0.11557065
to speak but I think even though that she even though she loves the Queen,0.119317174
she does use sex in order to gain that power she uses it as a,0.59157515
way of maintaining her control and her dominance this film is so similar to one,0.13305439
of my favorite Hollywood films of all time it came out in 1950 and that,0.077254646
is the lady eve and abigail played by Emma Stone is Eve essentially this girl,0.10408669
who has fallen on hard times and has clawed her way back to civility and,0.12269127
will do anything she can to obtain regain her her status as a lady she's,0.5154597
indulging the queen in the way that Sarah no longer does she is romanticizing everything,0.1477883
and in a way that maybe the Queen isn't used to hasn't been used to,0.063113324
in a long time and the Queen brilliantly played by Olivia Colman has the most,0.08835394
pivotal role here to me she is absolutely true heart of the film the true,0.07952699
emotion because she is so painfully lonely and pathetic and she is rotting at the,0.8606264
center and is somebody who has lost a lot in her life and it has,0.11430127
caged her it has made her incapable of living especially physically she has like gout,0.5447516
in her legs the food that she's indulging in makes her sick all the time,0.60813147
she's just become this physical manifestation of pain she needs love so desperately and it,0.24524103
is so it is aggressively apparent she's nearly like a child and in the way,0.25967282
that she behaves she needs attention and she can't accept truth or honesty anymore she,0.14992623
doesn't want to accept love in its most real form anymore she wants to address,0.13537489
and package in a more palatable way in the way that abigail is presenting but,0.06436009
she too finds her way to discover her power amidst this triangle between Abigail and,0.19058892
Sara they're fighting for her affection the key of course the symbolic key in this,0.07346325
film being the rabbit of course the rabbits in the film are a huge metaphor,0.05805832
that threads the film's internal I should say emotional logic together as the Queen says,0.10519596
in the movie each rabbit represents the children that she has lost and she's using,0.22455342
them to fill a void that can't be filled Sara recognizes that in her own,0.109633766
way she sees how sad it is how she's using these rabbits to replace something,0.23563403
that cannot be replaced she really refuses to pet the rabbit to acknowledge and acknowledge,0.14474222
them she says no I won't do that it's my Cobb whereas with Abigail Abigail,0.24185175
has that sentiment and that love that nurturing quality to her in terms of the,0.06460697
way that she's caring for the rabbits and that is the key that is what,0.1029377
draws those two together Abigail and and they find that common ground of emotional reason,0.067333154
that Ann left is on to very ignorant Lee and of course eventually things escalate,0.6340012
and Abigail eventually does turn and against her best friend Sarah when I think about,0.13184507
that at first I found that to be a really deeply sad thing and it,0.05535849
is a sad thing don't get me wrong but the more I think about it,0.093229994
especially after seeing it the second time I find that Sarah is the one who,0.07404234
might have the more happy ending here she is the one really when you think,0.12692
about it who is most free in the end yes is her political power yes,0.074140586
she loses her status and more importantly her best friend but perhaps it will be,0.15344445
a learning experience for her then again maybe not but I do think that she,0.111968726
has a better chance of finding happiness than either of the other two the whole,0.05168235
point of sapphires like these and absurdist comedies like these and you can even say,0.44939667
the same in a way for All About Eve I think that they all reveal,0.037747912
people trying very hard to cover up their flaws with with makeup and fancy clothes,0.16472769
and expensive jewelry that they start to lose themselves and lose their identity yeah I,0.13180803
know that's a very obvious thing to say but it's so easy for that to,0.07893231
become trite because we do see it quite often but with this film I just,0.11420806
think the art direction the embellishments the meson scene everything about it as beautiful as,0.075747736
it is and as alluring as it is it is also like I said something,0.071382396
grotesque about it it works with the characters but it also attracts them there are,0.15298048
many facets within the art design within the dialogue of the characters that makes this,0.02743681
film enticing but ultimately very eerie and haunting final shot is my absolute favorite moment,0.23967682
in the film without question it's definitely the most surrealist the most abstract part of,0.06055278
the film and to me is the closest to what length ammos actually say it's,0.12243015
closer to lent the most as earlier works and his philosophy philosophy for me just,0.13026005
as an artist it's a complicated image but it's a really powerful one it reveals,0.092879936
exactly what I said about Anna not Abigail that they do end up prisoners caged,0.25298524
by their own desires which does eventually cloud their judgment abigail worked so hard to,0.046038814
finally be seen as a lady again to be a woman of royalty but she,0.14619927
ends up a slave to and wants and needs just as she was before she,0.44372714
is still a slave just this time she's in a palace and deeply unhappy for,0.4661232
me and has the most tragic end of all because she wanted love and she,0.25642782
saw that Romanticism at that nurturing aspect in Abigail but she realizes too late that,0.0733739
Abigail doesn't care about her and sees Abigail squash the little rabbit with her heel,0.34445196
and that's the moment when she realizes that this girl is a and she's somebody,0.2876393
that couldn't be trusted all along but rather than recognize that and sent her away,0.14223959
her loneliness her need for a love kind of again clouds her judgment and she,0.15526006
asserts her dominance as one does to protect themselves and she asks for sex from,0.5876557
her I shouldn't say she asked for it she demands it of her she's trying,0.12056963
so hard to maintain that control and her face in that last moment is absolutely,0.15077272
heartbreaking there is nothing you phoric or sexy and in this climax instead you just,0.3177002
feel her pain and her loneliness and she's more disconnected than ever before and then,0.34947833
Abigail - she has been reduced to the lowest of the low the way that,0.18260458
their face is the way they transpose the faces over one another I think allows,0.26278362
us to see how they are the same they are both prisoners they are the,0.105112106
rabbits that are caged trying to fill their voids with one another and it is,0.19508108
not working they lost themselves in the hunt for something true and even earlier in,0.09894274
the film when abigail first admires the rabbits and says that you know again they,0.06836342
represent the children that she lost and that a little bit of her died with,0.46807995
each child and now all she has is the rabbits seeing all of those rabbits,0.26648855
sort of oval overlap is a very creepy image it's claustrophobic feeling but it completely,0.19923544
works this is a very well-done film I think I think it's one that accentuates,0.08426338
lanta most strengths as well as proving that he has a level of maturity and,0.12179687
slice of textual maturity and I didn't really expect that much from him as he,0.13514872
is deviating a little bit from his comfort zone it's exciting it's exciting to see,0.09088761
I'm a big fan and I look forward to what he does next and that,0.059321936
