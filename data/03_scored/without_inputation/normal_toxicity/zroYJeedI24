spider people running around because there's different timelines that have been impacted and all these different spire people come together to defeat this evil threat it's okay and that's all I'm gonna say,0.24230358
so let's go ahead and get into what I liked about this film first and foremost can we get on this soundtrack,0.122373074
because when the music started playing there was a certain song that was clear I was like oh so yeah really going there like yeah really gonna do this with him music I really enjoyed this music I'm definitely buffing this soundtrack when it comes out and I need to check it out,0.060558777
yes I can go ahead and start buffing this on the way to work tomorrow but I love the music for this film I'm also to the animation what I love about animated films,0.07613243
and why this makes the most perfect spider-man movie the bed spider-man movie out of all the spider-man movies it's just that there's no limit to what you can do with animation as far as what spider-man can and cannot do,0.19497702
and so I have to say the animation is so top-notch that you truly feel like you're watching a comic book,0.1910776
literally I felt like I was going through frame by frame by frame of reading a comic book and I was just like wow you guys did a very great job hood says even from where Mouse is talking to himself you see the little the boxes that you would see if you were reading the comic to hear his inner thoughts,0.06746829
and I just thought it was so great even with the noises you see just how they perfectly drew this film and turning into this animated film it was so beautifully,0.10803872
well done it as I said in my intro this movie has already been nominated for a Golden Globe,0.13674413
I truly believe that it has what it takes to take best animated films for the Golden Globes and to also earn an Oscar nomination and to actually win in that category,0.06310859
also - I didn't know all these people was in this you had should make more who was playing Miles Morales then you had we had Jake Johnson who was playing Peter B Parker you had zoe kravitz in this you had Chris Pine in this Oscar Isaac Liev Schreiber I was just like dang how much are these people to be in this movie because yeah I was just,0.13862053
jamming yeah so John's gonna come for everybody's thoughts what everybody's voicing these characters in this film and I love that the focus still remains on,0.06936798
miles I have to say that was a little weird because I was just like yeah kind of changing it up a little bit especially with throwing so many different characters from,0.10982333
different you know from different Spider versus into the,0.05417502
mix I really felt that for a,0.035816014
moment I was worried that the attention was gonna be taken away from,0.07884721
Miles,0.03448684
but I'm happy to say that it wasn't we got to see a lot of his interactions with his family on personal things that he was going through with his family betraying relationships with his father and then also to relationships between him and his uncle who was voiced by my Hershel I'll eat another,0.15297404
I was like wow that you hair,0.1498671
Brian Harry tyrita was voicing his father I was just like y'all did that but to see the relationship from the bottom between a black a young black man in his black father and also to with the Latino aspect,0.10511774
I thought it was so amazing to watch and one of my favorite scenes of this movie is this scene where Merrill's is kind of walking from school from home to his new school and kind of this code-switching thing that he goes through and he's going through kind of like talking in slang with his friends and then also to going through I'm him speaking Spanish as well,0.10634419
and so I thought that was so freaking cool I mean I also had a chance to interview more at the Lennon red carpet premiere which I want to be posting an interview after this video he actually I'm learning Spanish from The Voice coaches and it was really important to make sure that they brought in Miles his culture,0.23982549
I'm from being afro Latino and I thought it was great to see on screen I really loved this movie yah I'm not gonna give too much away about this,0.4421759

it was two different ones,0.074841455
and I was like that was cute you guys did a really great job with that so much of a great job but I was just like why couldn't you put this effort this energy into all the other spider-man movies that you made so far,0.106774725
I'm just wondering like what was y'all doing this whole time,0.10843132
because this this right here this is which I should have been doing for everything else okay,0.105308495
so let's be happy,0.06788757
