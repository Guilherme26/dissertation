hi I'm a mandrill,0.09397754
and today I will be reviewing director Guillermo del Toro's 2017 movie the shape of water,0.08289168
it's basically the story of a mute woman who works in janitorial services and at her job,0.26213673
she encounters a nonhuman entity will just say that and a relationship build between,0.116443284
the two some would call it a modern-day beauty and the beast' del toro style or you could also say cutie and The Creature from the Black Lagoon because that's more accurate I heard about the movie I was not intrigued,0.1486358
I wasn't interested it kind of looks like Pan's Labyrinth and that rid didn't really get me excited,0.12872455
this director definitely has a style of his own and it's not a style,0.11027814
that's really me,0.06221911
but after watching the Oscars and seeing mr.,0.05303247
del Toro clean up,0.08546318
I thought okay fine maybe I should give this movie a chance maybe,0.10540841
it's actually good,0.06149451
well once again,0.060295697
this is not for me just gonna say overall it's very Pan's Labyrinth II in the visuals,0.087243356
and the story is also kind of Hellboy meets Beauty,0.09025341
and the Beast meets well as I said The Swamp Thing Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Aquaman to a certain extent,0.055875786
I don't know I had a really a hard time buying into the premise and going with it just so much was like uncomfortable,0.09120443
I liked the arrow we're in we're in I don't know if it's the 50s the 40s,0.11689833
I like the music they used from earlier times and they have a lot of vintage TV movie clips in the movie and when I saw that you know black and white clips I knew okay well there you go that's why it went in Oscar because there's a trend with the Oscars that I've noticed every movie that has a love for the cinema or an ode to cinema and film and it portrays some kind of old movie in it or embodies an old style those movies usually win Oscars,0.056558117
okay,0.050967902
yeah it made a nod to the past it acknowledged its history,0.06303304
but does that mean it deserves an Oscar just because it feels timeless the performances are good I wasn't blown away by anyone in particular,0.077667445
Michael Shannon was I mean he plays Michael Shannon at this point,0.08773394
I don't know if he's typecast or he gravitates towards roles that put him in this position where he is just a villain or very intense creepy scary Sally Hawkins as a mute had to do a lot of facial expressions and body acting,0.28192776
she did a good job,0.10040671
she really did they tried to set up this relationship between her and I guess her neighbor or caretaker played by Richard Jenkins but I don't know I didn't see it I felt like this movie wants us to believe oh these two go way back and they have a relationship,0.07210091
but I really did not get that even Octavia Spencer's character felt very theatrical with the fast-talking and the always blabbering because you know oh you have the nude girl of course she's gonna be friends with the girl who can't stop talking,0.3510328
because she just needs somebody to listen to her it feels like a trope it feels like something a little bit obvious,0.32058164
I don't know it felt theatrical,0.079137415
but I think that's what Guillermo goes for he goes for something kind of big and showy he's telling a fairy tale and you're often reminded that this is very much fantastical and not grounded in any reality but I still feel like he aims for reality,0.06496776
that's why I'm mentioning it,0.059858065
but maybe I'm completely wrong,0.07639134
maybe he just wants us to be in fantasy world,0.12039966
and forget about reality,0.06902809
forget about how unnatural people are how people talk how people interact with one another,0.15441437
he just inspires himself in real life,0.23447284
but then Chuck's it all out the window my gosh this movie gave me huge Amelie Pula Amelie Amelie vibes,0.17892797
that's one of my favorite movies I haven't seen it a long time as a teenager I watched it over and over and over again,0.05405597
so it's just a part of me the way Jumanji is watching this movie,0.09633239
I saw ok color theme is very Emily music with the accordion and everything very Emily quirky love story very Emily Richard Jenkins character painting near a window,0.05756367
it's a French movie for those who don't know about a quirky different unique wrenches Zooey Deschanel kind of girl it's just about her and her world and how she views the world and it's interesting talk about the best soundtrack ever in cinema shout out to yanti erson amazing,0.14496846
so one of the elements that is really showy and extra is the village,0.05395336
he has all the things that a villain has he's racist,0.4913292
a supremacist a religious fanatic,0.644954
he's an idiot,0.9594084
he's gross like wash your hands ill,0.8378574
and what he develops a mute fetish after he meets Eliza like he's power-hungry and insecure,0.46565035
and oh just too much too much for me,0.062511206
and we see this kind of rotten personality is portrayed and symbolism it's all I'm gonna say I don't want to spoil it,0.3816316
no pun intended I say this movie is pg-13,0.14390804
I don't know what its labels got some mature scenes in there - it's got some violence more than I thought it would have it's kind of visually,0.15410341
striking,0.13877332
so yeah I don't think it's for children no no and the female character at times kind of feels written by a man but I don't know I don't know all women,0.38302878
so I can't speak,0.07876239
but every morning in the tub really hey apparently this woman is exceptional and unusual,0.40313864
and it's a fantasy character when did she learn to tap dance I had questions why eggs exclusively it's not kind of bad for your diet,0.16517675
and then you have the fish dude,0.23980346
you know no sorry,0.11455214
I know,0.052295566
no,0.06626663
I don't love fish I eat fish,0.079968154
now he's not really a fish fine,0.17411667
he's not that far removed but he's not they mentioned that he might be some kind of South American godlike creature,0.2854056
Oh God no,0.08985096
he seemed to be very much mortal and always on the brink of death,0.4948879
I would say maybe he's an x-men character,0.31089434
you know,0.07163658
he's a mutant,0.6633877
he is a very more realistic portrayal of what you would expect Aquaman to be but hot no girl no no,0.4399551
I'll tell you what she was into the Mavs is what she was into I mean shape of water hawk,0.15605478
you know what I'm saying,0.084426485
I don't know it was really hard for me to buy into their evolving relationship insecurities much,0.0693238
she makes a speech at some point about feeling like an outsider feeling alone and deficient as a human being,0.3591447
but when he looks at her or when she's with him she feels completely just sounds like you've got major insecurity issues,0.11004147
and what you are so dissatisfied with who are that a human man could never be into you,0.5266366
you have to go and find your mate in the fish world,0.15577525
this is not the beginning of a healthy relationship,0.084991075
I had compassion for him as a living being a creature,0.42961463
I was like yes,0.058647066
it's unfair that he is in this tank that he was stolen that he was brought to this place to be researched and poked and prodded and mistreated,0.23983334
yes I can have compassion for him on that level,0.08821056
but as a love interest as a human being I have my limits,0.08756738
and I found them through this movie and it felt at time like they were trying to equate or some kind of metaphor between racism and fish ISM,0.24089867
I don't know I'm not saying that that's what they were going for,0.08185486
but it felt like they were leaning on oh just because it doesn't look like you you hate him they brought up racism in the movie they brought up homophobia in the movie they brought up just hating of people that aren't conventional to society in ways that I thought were kind of obvious and just too direct either,0.4726366
I have seen way too many movies about injustice and discrimination and I'm just fed up with it or it just kind of felt like a plot device and emotional manipulation almost to a certain extent,0.09182274
ah now you're supposed to hate,0.35526994
this character and have sympathy for this character and that's how you're gonna love the team of misfits that we're putting together for you,0.3382794
the end end is somewhat predictable not super predictable,0.09664012
but when they show Eliza has a certain characteristic in her childhood you can kind of expect the movie to go in a certain direction especially at the end,0.10481034
and that's what we get Oh cute creative who know this movie just felt like a spoof of lala land the romantic scenes,0.166059
the moments where we leave this reality,0.09611734
now we're in a dance sequence tab dancing etc,0.05452875
I don't want to say too much,0.09833056
but there's a whole Russian storyline to this movie that I felt was unnecessary,0.13609503
I didn't see how it added anything it was violent for violence,0.13678613
sake the character involved in that storyline could have been integrated in another way and would have served his purpose just as well my advice would be if they're gonna do a sequel,0.06994415
Marvel should snatch this movie up talk to your man Toro and turn this into the blueish green or teal Panther and we can have Wakanda in South America call it El Dorado I mean that's kind of what makandal was referred to as and in the end the creature could just be a guy in a suit and we see him you know exit the waters and is if it off and it's just William Levy under all of that mmm that would kill audiences you're welcome Marvel I will accept some royalty fees,0.17826132
thank you,0.039406788
I think,0.052704193
I said what I had to say about shape of water,0.07750452
it's not for me,0.14909957
if you like del Toro movies if you like Beauty and the Beast the concept if you're not averse to bestiality if you're into a mini pool on the movie in la-la land even to a certain extent,0.23981822
if you even like Finding Nemo watch this movie cinema for the graphics not so necessary at home sure more of a home movie I would say,0.13729858
but why he won all those Oscars,0.05534274
I'm sorry it's beyond me as I said I think it's just because he referenced old movies and they're just like oh look my grandfather was in this movie we should give him the Oscar just kidding lots of love anyway you're trying to talk what did you think of shape of water comment section below thanks for watching before you go like this video subscribe to music game news if you haven't already turned on that notification about if you have and have a blessed day,0.09144179
oh I didn't answer the question,0.05776398
so what is the shape of water is it an octagon is it a circle is it a triangle no its phallic piece,0.31286255
