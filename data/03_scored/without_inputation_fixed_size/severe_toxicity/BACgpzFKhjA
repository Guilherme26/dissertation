hey everyone it's Mariana and let's talk about Logan this is supposedly Hugh Jackman's last,0.0293346
appearance as Wolverine and it's also a pretty different approach to an x-men character on,0.01859521
film it's rated R is gritty it's dark and it's generally pretty grim and we,0.08979381
knew this was going to be different because of what we've seen in the trailers,0.026413778
but even after the trailers I still thought this movie was darker and more depressing,0.08440715
than I anticipated the movie focuses on this old and tired Wolverine he still has,0.035405066
his powers he can still rip people to shreds if she needs to but it's,0.22434418
not quite as easy as it used to be and life has definitely taken a,0.031844337
toll on him he is trying to take care of Professor X who is not,0.05250893
doing well either and ends up being responsible for a young mutant girl who is,0.2065801
being pursued by some bad people first of all it is so refreshing to see,0.07006978
a superhero film that is a smaller personal kind of story that focuses on character,0.018718934
and personal struggles rather than trying to go for the typical world and peril type,0.022426667
of plot now I'm not saying that all superhero movies need to be like this,0.045724723
and nothing that at all I love seeing superheroes work together and have fun with,0.036226567
their powers and I think it would be a huge bummer if all superhero movies,0.33527905
turned into these gritty dramas with heroes having personal crises but we've seen so many,0.036232553
comic book movies where the stakes are just huge and saving the world is the,0.03419044
focal point that smaller stories like this that just focus on the few characters are,0.014162425
a good change of pace and the R rating really helps with that as well,0.011527632
because it adds a layer of realism not just to the violence because obviously it,0.106299005
adds realism to the violence compared to pg-13 violence but also thematically Logan is a,0.052813586
pretty adult in serious film a big part of it is talking about how violence,0.11567145
has consequences and it's not just fun superhero time taking out the bad guys they,0.05707542
keep coming back to this theme in the movie and there's even a moment which,0.054802485
you may remember from the trailer where Logan picks up an x-men comic book and,0.016163297
says nothing happened like this in real life people die it is a bit ironic,0.46042827
that even though this is one of the main messages of the film we still,0.01837969
go to see it for entertainment and I've seen people say things on social media,0.027769422
along the lines of Logan was so much fun and the r-rated violence was so,0.10756951
cool and the whole point of the film is that violence and death is not,0.08273022
cool even if you're chilling the bad guys it still takes a toll on you,0.085967004
so it's a bit of a weird dynamic there I personally thought that they went,0.0758928
a little bit too far with the grittiness and the darkness of the whole thing,0.030037697
that's just a personal preference of mine because it is a really long movie and,0.021794742
I felt kind of emotionally tired after it it was 2 hours and 20 minutes,0.07173673
of Logan being old and depressed and everything hurts for him and everything is difficult,0.04654955
and professor X is senile and things are generally bad if there are a few,0.11508941
moments of humor but overall this film is kind of a downer because I like,0.027030403
Wolverine and it really is freaking sad to see him like this so a little,0.20162249
bit too long and a little bit too depressing for my taste just taking everything,0.3354239
into account however Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are just at their best here they,0.029609986
had something to work with as far as character depth they had a lot of,0.0153477825
great back-and-forth I loved the two of them in this movie and of course this,0.08688762
would not work if they didn't nail the casting of Laura aka x-23 because she's,0.043111883
a very important part of the story and Daphne Keane is excellent she has so,0.014804993
much energy she's definitely a strong presence and she was the perfect kid to cast,0.06686094
here the villains were okay as characters Boyd Holbrook stood out in particular because he,0.094316386
was pretty charismatic but generally they didn't get much backstory or development and on that,0.030850552
note we really didn't get much explanation as far as how we got from 2023,0.010218551
which is the ending of Days of Future past and everything seems pretty great -,0.04299481
just six years later it's 2029 and here we are with Logan everything just sucks,0.41205114
and you know it's not good I felt like in the movie that was this,0.042863104
long they could have found a way to explore that a little bit more and,0.0429243
I did wish there was more of an explanation as to what happened because it,0.02222578
hasn't been that long since everything was fine but I guess that's just not the,0.013159993
story they wanted to tell in this movie overall Logan is absolutely worth watching if,0.030708868
you're a fan of x-men if you're a fan of Hugh Jackman is Wolverine it,0.15667003
is a different personal more dramatic take on an aging superhero I hesitate to say,0.029711759
that I enjoyed it it's just not the right word for this movie experience I,0.04004206
really felt for the character and a lot of the film was heartbreaking because you,0.010688836
care for the character and it is a really good film superhero or not so,0.017598098
I'm going to be giving Logan a solid 4 out of 5 stars it is,0.029912643
easily obviously the best out of the standalone Wolverine movies and it is definitely one,0.052483656
of the best x-men movies in general that's it for my review of Logan let,0.057650138
me know what you guys thought of this movie in the comments below if you've,0.041505463
seen it already let me know how it ranks within the general x-men franchise and,0.027752792
let me know if any of you felt like I did and thought it was,0.027394257
a little bit too dark just a little bit but kind of still enjoyed the,0.2297704
whole idea of having a dark dramatic superhero movie I'm very conflicted as you can,0.06323103
