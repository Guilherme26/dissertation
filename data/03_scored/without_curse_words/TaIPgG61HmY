logan is directed by james mangold and is the final portrayal of wolverine by hugh,0.07282457
jackman or so he says james mangold last directed the wolverine which i thought was,0.18858877
pretty good up until the third act which got really silly but up until then,0.48972017
I was like yes this is what I need and if you watch the extended,0.09085708
cut of the Wolverine it's even better so I was happy that James Mangold was,0.11449363
returning to direct this final portrayal of such an iconic character I'm going to go,0.0793116
very light on the plot synopsis because I got to see this very early at,0.057298437
a press screening and basically Logan has to cart this girl around he's not entirely,0.19251889
sure what her backstory is and as he learns more about it he learns more,0.07843203
about himself as well so as Wolverine is slicing and dicing various bad guys he,0.32830274
and Professor X have to try to protect this girl who may not really need,0.379882
that much protection because she's got some tricks up her sleeve this is also the,0.10498837
first movie featuring Wolverine to be rated R this film is brutal oh my god,0.15124935
there is so much blood and limbs I loved it they really didn't hold anything,0.15134808
back Wolverine goes absolutely berserk on people in this movie he's chopping off limbs he's,0.63507164
impaling people and it's not squeaky clean there's blood everywhere and my god it's great,0.50461537
from an action standpoint this is probably my favorite in the x-men universe not just,0.084960215
because of the fact that it doesn't hold back but because Wolverine is old he's,0.09956214
tired he's broken down he's beaten physically and emotionally he's doing back-alley drug deals to,0.31089434
get pills for Professor X I mean this guy is just a complete shadow of,0.5600994
what he used to be so when someone comes around challenging him it's amazing to,0.07385475
see that old Wolverine come out that insane Weapon X that we've come to love,0.30283406
in other movies really come to fruition again when just the right buttons are pushed,0.055314433
and this is something that I expected going in knowing that it's rated R knowing,0.050023526
that rating says strong brutal bloody violence that's what I want to see and we,0.5154597
do get that but from an emotional standpoint I was very satisfied with Logan in,0.046526663
regards to the fact this is more in line with what Christopher Nolan did with,0.08262611
Batman less of what we've seen with the Avengers Marvel movies this is a very,0.09645722
somber serious drama that contains exciting bursts of action throughout this isn't a movie where,0.06484759
our heroes walk around sad and depressed the entire time it's not completely devoid of,0.07492807
humor it has a lot of fun in there as well and some good jokes,0.056934223
but it is kept at a very gracious minimum this is a dark violent movie,0.28375298
in which very little hope remains for these characters they're at about 99.9% done with,0.046966024
hope there is a very tiny little shred of it remaining in these characters eyes,0.3129256
it is so great and riveting to see these characters we've grown to love put,0.061151735
in a place that's so dark and so small and almost completely forgotten about that,0.06986402
you just want to see them climb out of the hole they're in and watching,0.36971226
these characters especially the young girl in the film grow to appreciate one another and,0.10550699
learn to help each other again and be heroes again it was fantastic this movie,0.091935195
makes the curious choice of having the x-men comics physically exist in this world and,0.15008305
they're viewed as these fictional stories that people wrote based off of the real heroes,0.09882547
so Wolverine picks up an x-men comic and looks through a Yaz's bullsháá and throws,0.5149523
it away you know that's actually really smart I love that because it takes place,0.122526444
in the future of the timeline established in Days of Future past so you can,0.050146423
do a lot with what took place in between those two films and apparently a,0.12612407
lot of people are very happy with the x-men and view them as heroes and,0.06691654
so there's comic books that exist in this world about them and it's really actually,0.15156178
a very smart and fresh idea and I like the fact that include that in,0.057855345
there I would say the first act and the third act of this movie are,0.07185134
the best those two acts are extremely riveting very fast paced intense they almost feel,0.081785366
like westerns there's a definite Western sense to this movie that James Mangold is going,0.13244486
for even right down to a scene where the characters are watching the movie Shane,0.06221763
on TV but the second act turns into a roadtrip movie of sorts and it,0.08366637
meanders a little bit nothing from a dramatic standpoint that's very interesting is happening there,0.15053727
also wasn't a lot of action for that period that act was really taken to,0.08816258
make the little girl and Wolverine grow as characters and it wasn't quite as interesting,0.35420027
as I think it could have been the film sometimes chooses to focus on characters,0.039267212
that are nowhere near as compelling as the ones that we want it to focus,0.0955439
on it sometimes takes way too much time with other characters that I feel don't,0.0492816
really have that much weight or impact to this movie the film also makes another,0.071743675
interesting choice for the characters that to my knowledge has no basis in the comics,0.06778703
I believe the writers have completely invented this character for some it might be a,0.03330419
distraction gratefully it's handled pretty well it's actually kind of scary what they do with,0.15604451
a specific character in this film that to my knowledge as I said is completely,0.06443777
invented by the screenwriters his addition in this movie is fairly miniscule but some are,0.08855475
probably going to be annoyed by it because it's sort of invented again I've read,0.13770269
a lot of x-men comics but I haven't read all of them so if I'm,0.15172024
wrong I'm wrong but I think he mostly worked for this movie and I think,0.094597235
that if fans can accept the fact that not everything in these movies has to,0.0694287
be perfectly like the comics and that these are adaptations of the comics and I,0.09317461
think most men will be ok with it especially since it's brutal and kind of,0.2324558
terrifying actually now of course no spoilers but as for the way everything wraps up,0.08792761
in this movie I found it to be pretty satisfying I did want just a,0.0710624
little bit more emotionally just maybe a couple more little punches to my gut but,0.34979028
for the most part everything ended in a way that I think is very satisfactory,0.10364823
for longtime fans and for myself in particular it's not a perfect movie sometimes the,0.0861324
tone and the pacing of it all gets a little jumbled but as a final,0.10818397
portrayal of this character Hugh Jackman was just so badass he knocked it out of,0.32170668
the park once again for one last time seeing our beloved will be so broken,0.11316683
and learning about his past some things he maybe didn't even want to know about,0.07117362
it was kind of heart-wrenching and he did a fantastic job Patrick Stewart is also,0.071443
amazing in this movie I love the little girl as well I thought she was,0.21392407
very good James Mangold's vision for this movie is very beautiful I think it's a,0.10046694
very good-looking movie very well edited I liked Logan quite a bit I'm going to,0.108983144
give it an A - guys if you can't tell right now I am sick,0.3585667
as hell I have had the worst cold add in years and I drove myself,0.3770528
