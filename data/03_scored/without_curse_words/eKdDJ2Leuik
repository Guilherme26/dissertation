[Laughter] what is going on everyone welcome back to feel these flicks for episode 2,0.11026805
it's movie Monday so you know what that means it's time to talk about a,0.06149933
movie here and for this installment it's The Godfather I was really really excited to,0.07591151
see this one and hey I'll tell you what I'll make you an offer you,0.14111692

out on my social media accounts I'm just trying to grow and build my community,0.096620984
every day I'm working really hard to not only work on my blog but my,0.09202399
youtube channel as well so if you could hit that subscribe button I would really,0.31137353
appreciate it now on with the review the godfather was directed by Francis Ford Coppola,0.0892359
and came out in 1972 as it stars Marlon Brando Al Pacino Robert Duvall James,0.10185636
Caan Diane Keaton as it headlines a star-studded cast for what is an incredible movie,0.087960064
there's a reason why this is a classic and I think we're gonna get into,0.09082093
it but it is just so well done and Francis Ford Coppola Bravo to you,0.111387715
sir because this movie is a hit and I can totally understand why now the,0.11654909
film follows the Corleone family was part of the Italian mafia in the 1940s in,0.16853406
New York and the power struggle that goes on with the other families in the,0.05095516
Mafia during this time period is very prevalent and a big part of this film,0.17818365
but also the characters that really stand out in the family specifically have to be,0.05539907
Vito played by Marlon Brando and Michael played by Al Pacino their characters are integral,0.046863116
to the main plot of the story as they're highly involved together but it's interesting,0.0736476
because since Michael was involved in world war two he comes back and is not,0.11790377
really a part of the family business and was kind of not dealt in on,0.0524638
things but since he is Beto's favorite son Vienna really wants him to have the,0.10329438
business and really run things but Michael really isn't into it at the start really,0.06609118
important quote that Michael says in the beginning of the film it's during the wedding,0.048328146
scene he's talking to Kay in case asking him are you a part of this,0.15533389
do you know what's going on and he says that's my family kay it's not,0.07786713
me this is the important one this is the one that shows that's where Michael,0.07998331
is in the beginning and then his transformation to the end of the film is,0.06322772
really the most intriguing part I saw a movie a couple weeks ago Goodfellas which,0.061527234
was a great movie the mob boss is the guy that you should be feared,0.33570865
he should really respect him and you know he's the guy who gets stuff done,0.1725646
and that I just felt like he was doing his thing he's grilling sausages and,0.32812187
just kind of they're in this one Brando really has that figure and that aura,0.07825724
about him that just commands respect and commands attention because every time he has a,0.087593704
scene you pay attention and you know better because if you don't then you're in,0.09535015
trouble I think it's interesting to kind of show that even though he has so,0.1397638
much power and even though he's done so much he's kind of off his game,0.11301418
he's kind of at the tail end at his career and that's a turning point,0.15473868
for a lot of families that are in the Mafia at that time and they,0.11705282
kind of want him gone so they try and do anything that they can to,0.14324549
take him out and try and supersede his power the Corleone family they're not gonna,0.1650579
let that happen they're gonna try and do the best they can to preserve that,0.044977114
power and Sonny the oldest son played by James Caan it was most notably also,0.08014119
in ELF playing Will Ferrell's dad does everything he can to try and preserve the,0.085026555
family business he's kind of like a wild card maverick sort of type deal he'll,0.25600633
kind of do what he wants and on impulse but he kind of won't think,0.1428604
things through and that's I think where Vito saw Michael was a little more rational,0.08491016
and can kind of do things by thinking them through instead of just kind of,0.083511844
like oh this happened I better retaliate and I think that's what makes Michael's characters,0.08464603
so engaging and so relatable is that in the beginning he's kind of like oh,0.06863952
I'm not involved in this like I shouldn't be he's just enjoying himself with Kay,0.15520127
and he's you know living his life but as soon as certain events happen Michael,0.1640034
starts to really change and I think that that turning point is the scene in,0.07276211
the restaurant where he deals with so the other head of the Italian mafia family,0.40333194
and the chief of police michael has a choice to make and ultimately that choice,0.10327972
is what changes his character for the rest of the film this movie is really,0.06825003
paced well and for it being almost a three-hour film for that to happen is,0.06937018
a pretty extraordinary feat and it's really a tale of two halves you have the,0.1281982
first half where Vito's character is in control and then the second half after he's,0.0544982
attempted on by the selasa family it's Michael's time to shine and I think that,0.085244544
that's really well done in a sense of showing how they're different but also it's,0.057178937
very similar and I think that's why Beto liked him so much because he was,0.10713385
so much like Michael was so much like him and the ending is just great,0.11435789
because it sets up that line that I mentioned earlier in the beginning it shows,0.070133775
how Michael has come full circle from kind of going to I'm not involved That's,0.057497393
not me k2 I'm in this this is my life now I've accepted the family,0.09919917
I've accepted the family business and Kay asked him to tell him the truth and,0.040792592
he straight-up lies to her and that not only sets up more tension down the,0.490147
road but it also builds for another installment which we will get into next time,0.08380809
as I want to be a part 2 of The Godfather but overall as a,0.049767062
score I'm gonna get the Godfather a four point eight out of five that's the,0.06494815
highest rated score I've given a movie so it's a pretty good accomplishment to the,0.06504894
Godfather thank you all so much for watching it really means a lot to me,0.06494977
the support that I've gotten over the past month and a half since I've started,0.032795284
