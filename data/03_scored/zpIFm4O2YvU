what's up guys welcome to found flakes on this inning explained I'll be looking at,0.079140574
the new alien film arrival not to be confused with the mid-90s powerhouse the arrival,0.079235196
starring Charlie Sheen this has nothing to do with that and despite this movie featuring,0.1103208
Lois Lane and Hawkeye teaming up to deal with aliens there are no giant aliens,0.15629274
with laser cannons or anything like that bummer a rival is kind of like the,0.25714973
antithesis of the Independence Day sequel whereas that was an overblown spectacle this movie is,0.0831676
a much more subdued dramatic take on humanity's first contact with alien life so there's,0.27306977
a huge question at the core of this movie why are they here it's even,0.06305991
right there on the poster so we'll answer that but in addition to the ending,0.072354384
itself there is a theme throughout the movie that helps explain the movies concepts further,0.061858363
and gives a better grasp of what the ending means I'll get to that as,0.09139589
well so let's get going shall we our story begins introducing linguist teacher dr. banks,0.08748608
and her daughter Hannah we see several scenes as Hannah grows up to be a,0.10393045
teenager and then unfortunately succumbs to cancer these appear to all be in flashback and,0.5050616
take place before the main story we also get our first clue to the core,0.053154584
of their idea with Amy's daughter's name Hannah her name is a palindrome which means,0.07865653
it said the same four words as well as backwards in a sense there is,0.12236935
no beginning or end as both ways are correct now we catch up with dr.,0.05735316
banks in present day where during a class the world is shocked to learn that,0.06301075
12 shell-like spaceships have descended from the sky and planted themselves at random locations around,0.0976863
the globe a few days pass as everyone anxiously awaits to find out what the,0.08335793
ships are doing here are they here to attack or to help colonel weber then,0.1400727
enlist banks to help them decode the alien language playing our tape of strange noises,0.10881779
heard from the aliens so at this point the government already has been able to,0.07694772
communicate in some form with the aliens but they can't translate the sounds and they,0.079522885
need dr. banks along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly to help them understand what the,0.07503968
aliens are actually telling them every 18 hours an area at the bottom of the,0.23906463
ship opens up allowing the team to temporarily access inside the vessel and interact directly,0.053888883
with the aliens the aliens are known as hepta pods due to their seven tendrils,0.2784107
or legs they kind of look like a hand cross with an octopus and the,0.27838442
way they tend to communicate is via inky circles shot from the end of their,0.18588115
tendrils a majority of the movie is dedicated to the team learning more about how,0.060952626
to communicate with the aliens on each and understanding more about their intentions along the,0.14890559
way they do have two languages via the sounds they make and the circles but,0.0637786
most of the focus again is on the circles the way their language works is,0.041946523
within each circular shape they form there are distinct patterns and shapes and each of,0.037772376
these has a related meaning in our language like this one here might mean technology,0.07695594
this one weapon and this one cetera we are also told their language is nonlinear,0.11217494
which is well represented by the circles they create again there is no beginning or,0.050544724
into a circle just an infinite loop independent of the linear structure of our own,0.05644688
language and as dr. banks understands more of the aliens language she starts having more,0.09044362
and more of what are essentially visions of her deceased daughter and what we don't,0.24193515
see Hannah's father there is mention of him being a scientist hmm wonder who the,0.07688884
father is let's look at the cast here nlgger government guy don't think so Forest,0.48403737
Whitaker no that's a white baby what about Ritter well yeah obviously since he's the,0.53817415
only scientist with any lines in the movie but how is that possible if they,0.056831036
haven't even met each other before the arrival guess we don't have that one figured,0.07621474
out quite yet once they're able to communicate back and forth more successfully they translate,0.06277145
a message that seems to indicate that the aliens are here to give them a,0.11797308
gift or perhaps weapon of some kind now fearing an attack from the aliens the,0.24025795
government sends our team home and now it's up to the military to sort out,0.09692155
these alien buggers but dr. banks isn't willing to give up yet and has another,0.7232213
interaction with the alien now revealing their purpose for coming to our planet essentially in,0.122505695
three thousand years they need humanity's help and in order for us to help we,0.083259344
have to understand their language as you learn more of their language your brain is,0.55429256
essentially rewired and once you can totally understand their language you unlock its true power,0.101578
which is the ability to travel through time yep that is one powerful language but,0.050923932
this isn't time-travel in the traditional sense this is all mentally so the traveling seems,0.24154519
to be more of her accessing visions from a sort of unconscious astral plane of,0.13638826
time which now upon understanding the language she is allowed to see also potentially her,0.06689806
brain rewiring has unlocked a dormant part of her mind allowing her access to these,0.2421767
future visions and now that dr. banks fully understands the language she is even able,0.074764356
to manipulate the ink herself to make words she has now fully tapped into the,0.15637687
time travel abilities from their language with almost no time remaining before China launches its,0.11983978
offensive on their respective ship dr. banks flashes to herself at a gala she runs,0.15590395
into the military leader of China general Shang the man who has his finger on,0.31551784
the trigger back in present day he says to her he is appreciative for what,0.16172202
she's done and knew that he could trust her when she told him what she,0.123844884
did on the phone his wife's dying words which he now whispers into her ear,0.24207339
cut back to present time and dr. banks is able to use this information to,0.06681397
call The Dictator and get him to stand down from his attack saving the ships,0.53488815
from destruction so that scene at the gala and in fact all of the scenes,0.13368438
that appeared to be flashbacks are actually taking place in the future after the events,0.073682696
of the arrival so Louisa in the future got the last words of the dictators,0.14643428
wife which she's able to use in the past to stop him from attacking but,0.23994644
how does she get to that point in the future without already having the information,0.084765844
in the past well that's because this is one of those pesky time travelling paradoxes,0.12095917
but also because of the way time travel is treated in the movie there is,0.045015667
an explanation in this case as we've seen throughout the film there is the concept,0.026702369
of the circle or that things are the same forwards as well as backwards and,0.13500118
even their language itself is nonlinear so that to me means that even if something,0.08525879
is happening in the future time is an eternal circle so the concept of the,0.0586024
future or the past is meaningless time to them is handled in a totally different,0.07231983
way conceptually that it would be normally considered to us puny humans so that's why,0.31874302
it might seem like a paradox but in this case there is an explanation for,0.09971855
how it can still make sense it's also interesting because the aliens even knowing about,0.11199331
the future threat is another paradox due to the power of their language they are,0.1133884
aware that the threat is impending and have to go through this process in our,0.077368364
present time to teach their language to humans as they're doing what they are supposed,0.12120828
to do in order to make the events in the future happen but how do,0.041724842
they know in the present about the future just like with the general it's all,0.034666605
due to the circular nature of how they consider time and not really a paradox,0.08127271
in this universe the other side of their version of time-travel is nothing can be,0.073806904
changed things are always going to happen in one way no matter what we do,0.08535881
this is applied directly to dr. banks and our unborn in the present daughter she,0.06658278
is already aware of exactly what is going to happen to Hana dying at an,0.09278929
early age so now she knows about it but again has no control over this,0.096496925
inevitability though she does choose to appreciate the time she has rather than dwelling on,0.07796531
the depressing outcome which is quite noble of her and without sounding too sappy a,0.17285703
pretty powerful overall message what you have because it won't last forever it's also clear,0.05706771
now that dr. banks is special in the sense that she is the only one,0.07522132
that can first unlock the languages code the aliens already know this due to their,0.07989677
powers that she is the one that will translate the code in the present leading,0.06912408
to teaching the others and helping them in the future and even before dr. banks,0.06935836
meets the aliens she is already having future visions of her daughter and they are,0.26065922
sort of subtly guiding her on the path to further understanding their language and now,0.069343984
the ships have left our planet dr. banks and Rin er will go on to,0.06169906
have Hannah unfortunately Ritter does eventually leave before the child's death I have a feeling,0.19367203
that dr. banks eventually revealed she knew what was going to happen to their daughter,0.12425472
the whole time and didn't share it with him until way later down the line,0.07140837
it's a pretty miserable way for things to turn out honestly one thing I really,0.35566184
am curious about though at the end dr. banks publishes a book about the aliens,0.0670872
language so now everyone around the world can understand it too but does that mean,0.06353659
that everyone would be able to access the same time travel ability of dr. banks,0.0764152
I'm not really sure but it does seem to be the direction they're implying so,0.041398026
apparently the entire human race needs to understand their language for that threat coming thousands,0.37798065
of years in the future we don't know what the threat is exactly but it,0.07806109
is still bizarre to consider everyone around the world fluttering in and out of different,0.098153226
time periods in their life all the time there you go folks the quite confusing,0.10447984
ending of arrival explained whatever time-travel is on the table it's always going to get,0.05361155
complicated but what did you guys think of arrival any other lingering questions you have,0.07823999
that I missed and if there's any other movie endings you want me to explain,0.06387321
let me know in the comments below thanks for watching found flicks see you next,0.10681024
