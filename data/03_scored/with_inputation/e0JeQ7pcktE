a star's born as the third remake of the tried and true story it stars,0.050590176
Lady gaga and it marks Bradley Cooper's directorial debut so let's talk about in the,0.19250566
film cooper plays an established singer-songwriter whose career is on the decline when he meets,0.0836791
Ally Lady Gaga he recognizes her talents immediately and decides to take a chance on,0.09503438
her hi if you're new here my name is Shawn Chandler and I started this,0.16625689
channel cuz I was driving everyone around me crazy talking about movies way too much,0.29898447
if you can relate to that that you like to talk about movies more than,0.03973163
the people around you you're probably in the right place and with that in mind,0.11742444
I'd love it if you tell me your thoughts on the movie down below in,0.30853313
the comments section are you excited for it have you already seen it did you,0.08240443
love it did you hate it all of that fun stuff let's have a nice,0.42660117
lively discussion with that said let's get started talking about the good probably the absolute,0.06531074
best thing about this movie for me is that it really does cover this full,0.08429645
spectrum of human emotions and life experiences like during the first 30 minutes of the,0.06973107
movie I was really surprised at just how funny it actually was and then it,0.055418085
becomes very romantic at times it's very tragic heavy dark at other points in time,0.07321367
in the film and then of course as it is a movie called a star,0.066592135
is born you have these moments of becoming as Lady Gaga's character is fully realized,0.09109027
and people discover it by the end of the film you feel like you've gone,0.082080655
on a very full emotional journey and been to so many different places that it,0.032562777
leaves you very satisfied and a large part of the reason that this movie works,0.10474302
is because of the performances everyone in this movie is just absolutely phenomenal and so,0.05944298
much of it boils down to just the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga,0.15290947
you buy this strange interconnected relationship that's complex each of the characters are nuanced there's,0.06704663
things you love about them there's things you hate about them there's things where you,0.29520103
just want them so much to do something that they won't do and other times,0.0927871
they're doing things you wish they weren't doing and all of it makes for this,0.09677667
web of relationships the tie into careers that just keep you captivated from beginning to,0.05958126
end and all of them are absolutely convincing as all of this is taking place,0.16707152
Bradley Cooper has to be so many different things as this very broken character and,0.10698229
times you love him at times you hate him and you see him in so,0.44221997
many different lights and he just disappears the guy that you saw in The Hangover,0.15102656
is gone the guy from the a team isn't there this is this character brought,0.089127794
on to the screen likewise lady gaga plays a character that's taken on a huge,0.14899191
journey throughout the film and you would never guess she's a singer turned actress from,0.15142249
watching this film she did really in a new way a star an acting star,0.11160928
is born in her performance in this film in some ways yeah we knew that,0.058609433
Bradley Cooper was probably gonna be great on screen as an actor but we didn't,0.079330705
necessarily know is how great he was gonna be behind the scenes as the director,0.049724963
and he does a bunch of things great here as a storyteller first off he,0.14896567
does use a lot of visual techniques to draw our attention to just the right,0.043905035
details so he learned the information we need not by being told but by him,0.066134006
drawing us our attention to things by focusing in on things that help us to,0.062900685
understand what's happening in a visual way so we start putting the film together and,0.06466672
to that point part of what he does so well as a director is he's,0.07166453
always hinting at what's about to happen you don't necessarily know it as lines or,0.073891774
ceteris or eyes are drawn to something but he's always pointing toward us towards what's,0.12726103
about to happen and so lines of dialogue will happen and then two scenes later,0.11780594
as the events start to come together you get a sense of excitement you get,0.07630661
a sense of dread you get a sense of romance as you start to see,0.122851275
how it's fitting together and you're piecing it together in the good way you're able,0.1352007
to predict something that's about to happen not because the movies predictable but because he's,0.10440481
put all the pieces in place so you have that right sense of anticipation for,0.12728988
what's about to happen and as this is a musical you've got to talk about,0.0810098
the music itself and it is of course just phenomenal how much these songs both,0.050071217
tie into the themes of the movie itself and are just good songs that you,0.15497059
want to listen to once you leave the theater and like I said we didn't,0.08196303
know that Bradley Cooper could direct I didn't know that he could sing he's he,0.12765503
keeps up with Lady Gaga which is quite impressive I'd also highly recommend you check,0.08613226
this one out at a theater with a great sound system I got lucky in,0.06263626
the screening I was that might have the best Soundsystem in all of the Austin,0.101903684
area and I mean you felt like you were in a concert when they did,0.22586049
these concert sequences it's just how full and you could hear the crowd the separation,0.102243915
everything highly encourage you to check it out at a place with a great sound,0.065300845
system with that said let's move on to the mix aspects of the film and,0.025626877
the big thing that comes to mind really is just that the movie changes pretty,0.09036406
drastically as it goes along the first act or so maybe the first 40 minutes,0.09856052
of the movie moves it kind of one pace the stories to hold in one,0.041573297
fashion and as soon as things start to kick into action the way it's edited,0.31089434
the way scenes play out all of it changes and some of that factors into,0.057259094
the nature of the story itself what's going on with the characters and sort of,0.030339286
mirrors kind of the changes in their lives and things like that so it makes,0.08535635
sense it's not like it's executed poorly but it is a very big change so,0.15197162
if you love what's happening at the beginning you might be frustrated with what happens,0.116612054
as you move into the second and third acts of the film from there let's,0.06639224
move on to the negative aspects of the film and this is really a continuation,0.065649524
of what I just mentioned before but because the pacing changes so much in the,0.04719349
relationship dynamics change so much as you transition into the second act of the film,0.088763975
some of the storytelling momentum is lost a little bit some of the relational dynamics,0.09897322
are lost the chemistry isn't quite as strong because you're not sitting in them quite,0.11736263
as much as you were at the beginning you spend a lot of time in,0.0638974
individual scenes and sequences and then because things move so much quicker in the second,0.055550028
half of the film you're not sitting there as long where's the first act covers,0.13605796
a very small amount of time the rest of the film kind of montages through,0.06096731
big chunks of time and so there's a cost when you do things like that,0.098684646
before I get my final take on this movie be sure to tell me down,0.12808526
below in the comment section what did you think about it did you love it,0.10478862
- Jane have you seen it yet all that fun stuff I'd love to hear,0.06589253
take on this film as for me I'm gonna score this one in a and,0.1422373
a nine point five out of ten this was just this is classic great movie,0.07358631
