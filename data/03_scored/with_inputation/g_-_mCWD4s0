so Alfonzo Kieran's Roma uh a lot of people know Alphonso Curran from stuff like,0.15745941
gravity and children have been or if you've never seen any of those films you,0.3165982
probably know him best from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and if you,0.05932379
if you're familiar with qur'an's work and stuff like you know gravity especially you know,0.0643369
that he likes to do to do big and long and long one take shots,0.33020392
where where he does like you know everything like you know you know like Goodfellas,0.094974205
type stuff or you know it's just like the one following camera and over one,0.07116072
long shot which there is there's a lot of that in Romo but actually it's,0.06395112
it's kind of interesting because Romo doesn't feel it does feel big in in terms,0.07598579
of like how its shot and its scope but its story it actually feels the,0.11230244
story actually feels pretty pretty simple I mean in terms of how its set up,0.13913953
here it takes place in the 1970s in Mexico City I believe yep in Mexico,0.08657249
City or essentially we follow this character of Cleo who's a made for this for,0.098397784
this Mexican family and she you know she she works well with the kids you,0.18905134
know she she likes them she doesn't mind working for the family they they have,0.16014817
a good relationship you know the you know the mother and father they're they're not,0.1357659
on good terms but there are good terms with Cleo they they like her and,0.079827756
the kids like her too she's a great person but they have problems with you,0.26452586
know with with you know like there's a revolution going on in their society where,0.105593674
things seem very very heated out out there that you know that that it can,0.08653675
be hard to you know to trust the world out there so of course so,0.13495496
Cleo feels a little bit more at home with the family she feels like she,0.14379184
can connect with the kids and stuff like that but then kind of but then,0.09454055
called like like tragedy strikes when you know when when she connects with this one,0.11797447
boy and she discovers that she's pregnant and once when she breaks this news to,0.16286364
her boyfriend her boyfriend was basically just you know just out of there he's like,0.22060528
you know I pretty much like won her on a date and she says that,0.08648437
oh I think I'm pregnant he's gone out of there and when she later confronts,0.20022474
him he's just he's like no it's not mine and he's because he's a martial,0.45415342
artist he gets a little bit violent about it saying like like no I'm not,0.26228455
the father I'm not dealing with it goodbye and so it's basically Clio trying to,0.06510923
deal with her pregnancy while also trying to handle this family which the family is,0.1020403
also going through some tough times with each other they're havin they're havin some like,0.061731912
the kids are kind of fighting with each other the mom and dad are fighting,0.15090337
with each other they're going into tough times and it's even tougher for Clio and,0.07810032
it's even tougher for society at large because there's a there's a revolution going on,0.07203786
in the streets and people are running around and protesting and some people are getting,0.12692982
shot right in front of them that's just it's it's horrifying to them it'sit's quite,0.644366
the experience but I love the fact that we always feel focused on on Cleo,0.093001254
Cleo is always always in focus we always focus on her we feel what she,0.098099895
feels we hear what she hears and see what she sees and and I guess,0.10771307
I mean I was gonna try to find a good way to segue into this,0.105513625
but I just I love the way that this one was shot I love the,0.07269865
way that they do have that they do kind of have like the long takes,0.068780884
but they're not it's kind of like elaborate long takes like there's one scene where,0.040163577
they're in a where they're in a furniture store and they're they're looking for like,0.08386676
a crib for Cleo's baby and they they're looking around and then they hear some,0.15095958
noise outside and the camera kind of tilts around and it looks outside and there's,0.045037612
like a you know there's gunshots in the screen there's all these protesters running they,0.083790764
look down from the window locks on the second floor and then they pan over,0.08840885
and they see some protesters run inside trying to hide and then while then we,0.13441788
while we pan with them we see some you know some people coming after them,0.07258611
with guns and they basically shoot them in the middle of the store there and,0.8305033
then we focus back on on Cleo and her reaction and her hurting the terror,0.29160118
on her face especially from what happens in that scene which I don't want to,0.3062075
reveal there's a lot of tragic stuff that happens in this film that I don't,0.07538272
want to reveal just because it's so heartbreaking and I love the fact that I,0.067081794
don't think there's much music in the film - there's a lot of scenes where,0.05609372
we don't rely on music we just rely on how it's you know how the,0.05180749
scene is set up you know what is the emotion what's happening with the character,0.052373286
especially there's one incredibly tragic moment that happens towards the third act there's just there's,0.06730788
no music at all it feels like it could have been music and again most,0.08996601
of it's pretty much all in one take it feels like very much like a,0.11866296
classic film you know where they they'd hold on a shot for as long as,0.25667468
they could to draw out the drama from it and Kieran does that here he,0.08555127
does that here beautifully especially and a lot of people talked about this too on,0.067477465
the scene at the beach the scene where were both Clio and the family are,0.07286855
together at the beach after they both gone through huge traumatic experiences and they they,0.051334135
basically they break down they connect in that one scene that is that is beautifully,0.09931073
played up just because like it's kind of on like one shot for you know,0.3463522
when you know when it happens by the beach with like the waves and stuff,0.05873643
like that when they've just recovered from another trauma and when they all just kind,0.11777189
of like come together in that one moment when they all connect on it's just,0.07795552
it's such a beautiful moment I just just like the way it's shot in the,0.23991115
way that we go about following Cleo which doesn't feel like it's trying to be,0.05945009
overbearing it's just it works so well you you get engaged with it especially because,0.08661973
like like you've probably seen on the trailer they have a bunch of like nothing,0.31089434
moments there's moments where like like Cleo is just like just cleaning some clothes and,0.15523955
like the kids will be be having like a game of like cops and robbers,0.560766
and like you know they'll start bickering with each other or there'll be a scene,0.18485029
where you know she's she's serving up one of the boys breakfast and the boy,0.24254824
starts just having these kind of like imaginary conversations about how you know like oh,0.086488
I was I was a pilot before I died it's like oh really and then,0.1964761
and and then and even just like little moments that seem odd but but really,0.056839615
say a lot like there's one scene where we get to learn about the household,0.06956674
how the car has to park in the entryway which is very narrow so like,0.05727053
every time that their dad comes home he has to be very careful about getting,0.15542051
the car to the garage because it could like scrape against like the size of,0.10106924
the wall and stuff like that little moments like that where we we really do,0.09272137
get into Cleo's world um and and where we get to we get to know,0.09500563
enough about this family so that when tragedy strikes it strikes hard it it really,0.11821298
hits you to the core that there were there were moments in this where I,0.18301642
was on the verge of tears with how with how with how much like horrible,0.35889822
stuff happens to these characters and it's great because it doesn't feel like it's it's,0.07467964
trying to go too over-the-top with the tragedy it feels it feels very rooted in,0.05976646
reality as opposed to to melodrama and it actually plays out in a very very,0.124543965
beautiful way that that if it doesn't that you know for some people I can,0.09255178
imagine them seeing it as melodrama but I think it plays out in a way,0.081576414
that's that's very satisfying towards the end so so for roma i and i can't,0.06828272
underst I can immediately hear from people saying oh you know it's it's a foreign,0.1276321
film it's black and white you know it's it's stuff that I'm not gonna understand,0.27470213
I'm telling you if if you can understand you know what it's like being a,0.1135444
parent or caring for kids or being in a relationship that doesn't work I can't,0.06160368
see why you wouldn't be able to connect with this even for being you know,0.1283451
a foreign film where it's all spoken in Spanish and it's all black and white,0.088139646
and there's lots of like kind of like pillow shots of like water on the,0.118711926
ground or or beer bottles on tables and stuff like that I think I think,0.076583214
people will still be able to connect with that and also come on it's beautifully,0.14965154
shot like I said that scene at the beach is amazing just all the the,0.31089434
the cinematography is amazing I love the the very human story I mean this is,0.098653086
you know Alfonzo Kieran you'll see deals and kind of like you know fantastical stuff,0.12757722
like you know like children of men and gravity and Harry Potter but here this,0.14923975
was probably this most human film and the more I thought about it I kept,0.06650146
thinking you know because it feels so human and more relatable I think this this,0.11671934
might be my favorite Alfonso Kira on film and that's saying something because I do,0.071337335
really hold children of men up there high like the those shots in children of,0.5860419
men were like with you know like a lot of people know the car sequence,0.1432179
and then you know the the going up the apartment you know one talk well,0.035686344
the going up the apartment stairs one take shots those are those are great that's,0.19297343
probably one of my favorite films ever but I think I think roma Roma kind,0.0907398
of beat seroma just has it feels like it has a lot more to say,0.16526277
and it just it's it's such a great human story that's easy to connect with,0.07378449
that I think I just I I can't get my mind I'm still thinking about,0.091620736
this film days after seeing it so see after Roma 5 out of 5 stars,0.07884816
I just what can I say it's it's my favorite I'll found silkier on film,0.08499294
