hello everybody my name is Brandon Nikita Brando critic and today we will be discussing,0.1097537
a star is born yes I know it is rather late this movie came out,0.07551427
quite a few months ago life got in the way here we go so I,0.10886327
just want to state rap the bat that I have not seen any other versions,0.10045637
of this movie I haven't seen the movie in the 50s I haven't seen the,0.052530043
movie from the 70s the 2018 version is the only version I've ever seen so,0.061449397
we have Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga going on this musical adventure together Bradley Cooper,0.1879384
is Jack this really famous country slash rock singer and his career is kind of,0.087897144
waning down because he is an alcoholic a drug addict and his life and his,0.8208505
music and his career is just devoid of passion at this point and he's just,0.21087322
going towards drugs and alcohol to try to fill that void until Ali comes along,0.15311313
played by Lady gaga and she's just singing in some random bar Bradley Cooper's Jack,0.32819152
sees her and then he starts to get some passion again in his life and,0.14883067
passion in his music and of course they fall in love and a star is,0.12730944
born so a lot of my friends that have seen this movie they really love,0.08304005
it they say Brandon you got to see this I can't with you've waited this,0.15254498
long to go see it I know life has gotten in the way but for,0.047709808
me it's funny how a person's love for a movie really works because I can,0.09179347
go through each aspect of filmmaking in this movie the directing screenwriting cinematography editing sound,0.105371535
design the songs I'll talk about the songs and I can say that Bradley Cooper,0.06455696
and the filmmaking team did a great job at every aspect of the filmmaking process,0.06718212
but I can't say that I love this movie when you say that you love,0.07273985
a movie it's that unexplainable gut feeling that this film has impacted you in a,0.10990508
way that no other film has and you'll remember it forever that's why you love,0.06445153
a movie a star is born I will remember it for quite a long time,0.070036545
because this movie is emotionally heavy it's not such a light-hearted movie that you can,0.18085171
just walk in smile and leave and though that was a nice movie no it,0.12622319
does make you think it makes you really feel because this movie is powerful but,0.07948386
I don't know if I love it that's a whole other category but since this,0.058465663
movie is really good and it's really well made you might love it cuz I,0.14361328
know a lot of people do that doesn't mean that there's no scenes in the,0.05742582
movie that I love there are definitely some moments that I did tear up in,0.0629837
this movie guys it is rare for me to do that but the songs oh,0.17405625
my god when Lady Gaga performed that song I started to tear up it was,0.10145772
wonderful and you can see her when she's singing the song that she's playing this,0.11958904
character who's this lowlife I may be not low life but this unfamous person just,0.5534154
trying to make her way in the world she works for a shitty job and,0.91518015
she's just doing these gigs of these drag bars she wants her voice to be,0.4031004
heard and then as soon as she sings her song that she wrote and she,0.09546243
kind of does the oh my god I can't leave this is happening but she,0.0717858
keeps singing it's it's powerful stuff and Bradley Cooper's a good director for bringing that,0.0753477
out because a director's main job is to get the best possible performance out of,0.07621727
his actors or her actors whoever is directing the movie but Bradley Cooper man he,0.2760906
knows how to direct a movie because those emotional scenes especially when Lady Gaga is,0.13664846
singing her song that she wrote in front of him all these people she starts,0.10482786
to just oh my god I can't believe it and that is great acting great,0.07459887
directing and great chemistry between the two of them and that's another reason why I,0.056514587
really enjoyed this movie was because of the chemistry between Bradley Cooper's Jack and Lady,0.116614595
Gaga's Ally you know I've seen Lady Gaga perform all throughout my high school days,0.070027575
because that's when she got popular with Just Dance pokerface and I've seen her sing,0.121977806
at the Oscars so I didn't see her as just like this party girl I,0.19110939
saw her as this elegant singer who can sing like the really powerful music but,0.080683015
now after seeing this I know that she can act as well I mean Lady,0.2679271
Gaga is now becoming one of my favorite performers and I have so much more,0.05059806
respect for her because she can sing the pop songs she can sing the really,0.1076325
classical tunes and then she can also act in this movie and her chemistry with,0.07730675
Bradley Cooper is unprecedented because you really feel like these characters are in love you,0.088287875
don't actually see Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper acting you see Jack and Hallie fall,0.24199216
in love and you go through all the relationship problems that they go through and,0.14519966
it feels real it really does feel real and even when the movie was going,0.058763325
on and there was some slower parts I did feel my attention span start to,0.074036546
Griese and i was starting to think about other things like okay what am I,0.24241145
gonna do after the movie I'm kind of hungry I want to go to Montana's,0.09877462
but they just closed it down you know thinking of things that don't really matter,0.08206361
in the movie but what brought me back into it was Lady Gaga and Bradley,0.1579427
Cooper's connection with each other their chemistry and that is what really sells this movie,0.0727298
and when they sing together they're singing chemistry and the songs they elevate that chemistry,0.057815075
even more so those were the best parts of the movie and lastly I also,0.09031949
like that this film brought up the topic of fame and fortune and how it's,0.09377429
not always so glamorous you know you see these stars on TV and you think,0.07874663
oh my god I wish I could be just like them you know we look,0.06718467
up at celebrities and I mean I'm very fortunate enough that I have a roof,0.07830202
over my head and I have a good family but you know you can't help,0.11808684
but look at those celebrities and think oh my god I'd be amazing to have,0.06179769
a house like this and to have a career like this and have everyone idolize,0.08856707
you and you know it's the grass is always greener on the other side right,0.17028071
you can take a look at a celebrity and you say oh my god I,0.07363299
wish I could be just like them but then you start to realize that yes,0.10241798
being a celebrity has a lot of perks yes you generally get paid a lot,0.12214801
more you have a lot of fans and you get to do what you love,0.061155677
singing acting being an athlete who knows but then as well it becomes a whole,0.11273258
other set of issues comes with it right you may not have the same issues,0.11641813
that you have right now just being a normal everyday person but then you have,0.11839893
different problems with different perks so it's a catch-22 yes you would like to be,0.16067933
famous but you still have a whole other issue and a whole lot of other,0.10477343
problems that go with it and you see it in this movie you know as,0.13769868
soon as Lady Gaga's Ally becomes famous you know as soon as the star is,0.091403835
born then it becomes a whole their issue right she wanted to become a singer,0.15243678
thought she could share her voice and share her passion for music which she does,0.31089434
but then you know when her agents like will you need to this image right,0.08647979
we need to make you a brand a product to sell to customers so she's,0.10791952
not just a singer she's a li she needs to have her look she needs,0.15393727
to have her dance she needs to have her type of persona Michael Jackson didn't,0.11852853
just sing he sold his look his dance numbers his music videos is brand right,0.16133945
as soon as you get that big you become a brand not just a person,0.15055652
and you might think that people are manipulating you into being a certain way to,0.19197652
get more money but that's the life right and then of course it brings jealousy,0.14579563
upon relationships because I will never know what it's like to date a famous person,0.24117583
I mean I've never seen ever but as as at this point right now my,0.08035377
life I've never dated anyone famous and I will never know what it is like,0.092030905
to date a famous person or to date someone as a famous person right so,0.11608096
you can only see this movie and think it brings a whole other set of,0.10101119
challenges yes you would like to be famous and you'd like to meet all these,0.14283182
new people and have a lot of people idolize you but then again relationships and,0.07842909
dating having a family your career it's a whole other set of issues that you,0.10370035
have to deal with and I like that this film brought that into its story,0.06959055
and actually became a big part of the story and no spoilers but I knew,0.050186075
how this movie was gonna end right from the beginning there is a little bit,0.19384257
of early foreshadowing in this movie and I saw it right away and I said,0.11529887
okay well that's gonna happen but every single person I've talked to didn't notice it,0.08315918
and this is not people on the internet it's not people on YouTube or Instagram,0.17200992
it's just people that I know personally and they say oh I didn't see that,0.057345044
in the beginning how did you know that that was gonna happen so if you,0.062388994
spot it you can kind of guess where it's gonna go but if you don't,0.09911323
notice it then that's movie will take you on a loop so all in all,0.08424161
I'll give a star is born' a four out of five because again it's one,0.08453881
of those movies where I can look down every single aspect of the filmmaking and,0.112704016
say okay Bradley Cooper knows how to make a good movie and he delivers an,0.10710869
emotionally impactful one a really strong movie did it impact me in a way that,0.102911964
I can see that I love it like a Bohemian Rhapsody did it didn't but,0.10602047
that's the beauty of movies it impacts people differently so I can clearly say that,0.08144948
a star is born is a great movie and I do recommend it to everyone,0.080417715
out there because although I might not love it it might impact you in a,0.15890262
way to say that you of it or it might be your favorite movie ever,0.106193386
it's a good movie let's check it out for yourself so anyways guys thank you,0.14931099
so much for watching I know this review is very late this movie came out,0.1065668
quite a while ago but I finally was able to see it along with Creed,0.086190864
