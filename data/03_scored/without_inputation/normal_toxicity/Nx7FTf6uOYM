hey there guys so before we talk about Wonder Woman I first need to show,0.11090851
you this Wonder Woman is the latest film in the DC Universe of comic book,0.18152592
movies and they needed this to be a good movie and not only that I,0.09931564
think we all needed this to be a phenomenal movie to restore our faith in,0.090402745
the DC United was this a good movie hang on just one second and we'll,0.13857324
talk about that this will be directed by patty Jenkins who's mostly known for drinking,0.17858839
TV shows and I would say her most famous movie is monster which is also,0.35563663
about female empowerment in a very dark weird disgusting way now let's talk about Batman,0.6288108
V Superman like it or hate it one of the best surprises about that movie,0.14994936
was gal gadot as Wonder Woman and as far as gal gadot performance gal gadot,0.03424993
"gal gadot Yaga doesn't matter how I say her name 27,000 people down below in",0.3961895
the comments will say I said it wrong even if I say it right I'm,0.06539151
just going to refer to gal gadot as Wonder Woman from now on because in,0.12982601
my head that's who she is now now as far as her performance goes in,0.10050445
this film as Wonder Woman I really bought into it she brought a different element,0.09956491
that I wasn't quite expecting she have subtleties about her and I really enjoy that,0.12758449
I really enjoyed her natural foreign accent as Wonder Woman it made me bind to,0.14866966
the character and you really felt like she was from this foreign magical and mystical,0.06507491
faraway land in the movie when she's holding up her shield and swinging her sword,0.26280132
and wrapping the lasso of truth around people I was thinking to myself that is,0.08972077
Wonder Woman and I was also thinking I want her to wrap the lasso of,0.14629975
truth around me that just sounds like a really good time now the first act,0.11620747
of this movie is a straight-up origin story and it takes place on the island,0.11351474
of thermus kara you see a young Princess Diana training to be a warrior one,0.14279678
day and I really appreciated how quickly the film progressed and didn't drag out her,0.08788338
training sequences and it just got on with the rest of the story and one,0.03898251
of the best things about this film is the chemistry between Chris Pines character and,0.030890007
Wonder Woman throughout this movie Chris Pines character is this world war one spy named,0.14255276
Steve Trevor's and he and Princess Diana essentially had the same objective - in the,0.04036524
war the most interesting thing is they both have different beliefs on how to stop,0.22140588
the war ones realistic and ones mythological and for the most part I said it,0.16371368
was really clever how they tied in this mythological backstory into real-life events like world,0.12763464
war one but now let's talk about the character of Steven Rogers in this film,0.18001108
that's right I just said Steven Rogers aka Captain America and I don't feel mistaken,0.16261862
when I say that because in the film Wonder Woman the character Steven Trevor's is,0.04371375
essentially Captain America without the Super Soldier Serum and speaking of Captain America the First,0.08613123
Avenger it also feels like the film Wonder Woman borrows a few plot elements from,0.053494528
that movie and puts it into this one and that's not even a complaint I,0.16595444
actually don't mind and I think Wonder Woman is the better movie I do have,0.24255785
a few other quick positives to mention about the film and we'll dive into everyone's,0.07838507
favorite part the negatives with the movie one other aspect I really enjoyed about this,0.081689924
film was the fish-out-of-water story you had this character a Wonder Woman who's never been,0.124141954
off to this island filled with the chicks she's never even seen a dude before,0.44767636
and then you can't go and place her in this new environment everything that she's,0.17470063
seeing and doing for the first time was really entertaining and comedic to watch and,0.06405562
speaking of the comedy aspect in this movie sometimes when it comes to superhero comic,0.11527734
book movies when they interject that forced comedy to make people laugh and add levity,0.20200582
to the movie sometimes it takes me out of the movie and I'm just like,0.08042278
let's take serious let's go into battle kick some ass I don't need to laugh,0.8882755
about something stupid but in this movie it works but one of the best things,0.66166145
that this movie does is it makes you buy into the character or Wonder Woman,0.08909336
and there's one scene that you've seen in the trailers so I'm not spoiling anything,0.16171952
there's a scene in this film that takes place during World War 1 in the,0.11133814
trenches you have soldiers they're down-and-out there's blood there's guts there's gore it's pg-13 so,0.33130845
there's no guts or gore blood but it was the one scene in this film,0.25420406
where I bought in to Wonder Woman it's where I got goosebumps all over me,0.2957199
because she climbs out of this trench she D robes wearing the costume walking straight,0.31089434
at the enemies I just love scenes like that like it literally gives me goose,0.18251917
bumps down my arms now here are my negatives with the movie Wonder Woman as,0.28732306
I hold this sword now Wonder Woman once again is a comic book superhero movie,0.24174827
and this movie has a lot of cliches in it that you've seen in other,0.16118665
move but I will say this movie handles those cliches as well as it possibly,0.19411685
can now let's talk about the villains of this film there's multiple villains in this,0.08969523
movie and I didn't really enjoy any of them you have the dude who played,0.15499829
William Stryker in x-men origins playing once again another villain he craves power and he'll,0.23986147
do anything to get it and I hate to keep comparing this movie to Captain,0.24090044
America the First Avenger but this Nazi character and Wonder Woman was essentially Red Skull,0.45730567
but without the Red Skull and much like Captain America the First Avenger he also,0.30330783
has a sidekick character who's an evil scientist named dr. poison and yeah as far,0.48558256
as dr. poison goes in this film she was the most cliched over-the-top character in,0.31499222
the entire film and every time she was on screen it sort of took me,0.07089853
out of the movie she just really came across like this very heavy-handed one-dimensional evil,0.2989489
scientist and also at the very end of the movie much like every comic book,0.12083121
movie that comes out nowadays it gets super heavy-handed with the CG to the point,0.15128514
where it just feels like actors are standing in front of a green screen with,0.07604474
a fan blowing on them and it's forgivable for the most part because in a,0.31089434
superhero movie with godlike powers you have to have this big destruction battle scene but,0.15111582
I just was expecting a little something more out of this movie something a little,0.10687696
bit more subtle now here are my final flicking thoughts on Wonder Woman this is,0.18938361
arguably the best DC Universe film since Man of Steel I prefer Man of Steel,0.036360286
just a little bit more over this movie but I can understand if you like,0.15149388
this movie more than Man of Steel I really felt like they did everything that,0.10987391
they possibly could with the character of Wonder Woman to make you like the character,0.061679196
to make you get behind the character to give her an origin story that was,0.05656174
interesting Wonder Woman isn't a perfect movie but when it comes to a Wonder Woman,0.2934347
movie I really feel like it was the best thing that they possibly could have,0.09186858
done with her so I'm going to give the movie Wonder Woman aa a B+,0.151599
it's a solid movie it's really entertaining go check it out but I didn't really,0.05432096
