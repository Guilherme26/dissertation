plane or near you cuz I know it's in stuff like cities and stuff like,0.07836624
that but there's movies phenomenal guys it's just firm everything I tweeted out when I,0.08751867
got home that you know everything from the cast the cast was phenomenal to the,0.07219454
score so let's get a little bit into the cast I think there has to,0.086321495
be some Oscar nominations here for of course Sally Hawkins she was phenomenal in this,0.062625825
film she was just really great and she she does the whole ASL sign language,0.10119524
thing and she got kind of got a little bit backlash because I guess that,0.10426595
community was like saying you know what they're not really portraying how we really doing,0.13742718
stuff like that um but I'm not sure if excuse me if they really if,0.10672113
they seen the film now like if it's the same or different you know but,0.029135086
for me she did a really good job for in the performance overall yeah and,0.07521274
she was really good so I think most likely I feel like they're gonna give,0.07614162
her a nomination for that but another like as always guys Michael Shannon for me,0.12270857
it's just a phenomenal actor one of my favorite actors working today and I feel,0.064355604
like he's underrated I feel like he should have gotten nominated last year for nocturnal,0.10412039
animals for Best Supporting Actor and yeah but he was phenomenal as the villain and,0.1611722
man he they really do some some cool stuff with him he kind of just,0.1519919
embraces that whole villain like really good but same time in the movie I feel,0.15872177
like he do something's different with him kind of making you kind of feel for,0.1143692
him and kind of make him kind of bring him home and stuff like that,0.11707746
you know so you kind of couldn't tell what kind of life he has you,0.31089434
know at the same time he kind of I loved that he kind of just,0.08445364
pursues more he wants to be that that Top Gun you know that top guy,0.10559535
and he's trying to you know please is his a higher ups and stuff like,0.10717794
that but I yeah Micro Chanin he did a phenomenal job and another I feel,0.09052694
like Michaels not gonna get nominated because Rick Richard Jenkins man he was just so,0.15973227
good in this film you have to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor you know,0.084674574
he just did a phenomenal job and he they did some really interesting things with,0.058607038
his characters and you know normally water won't see normally I don't want to get,0.05334071
into that little debate or their little topic but yeah I was just surprised how,0.07356219
that decided to go through what scared him bug me or any issues okay cool,0.21954371
you know um you know you just don't expect that from like films you know,0.15250604
like they don't get that deep within these characters and their psyche and how they,0.06893432
how they do things and you know and so really there was one scene in,0.049963158
particular that I really liked him like when that little moment happened again no spoilers,0.09052242
my audience was like you know I was like well you can kind of tell,0.13078275
you know and I really liked that moment too because it sets up you know,0.06864338
his his character and the other person had to diner that's all I'm gonna say,0.14622039
or yeah the diner but I really liked that scene um but overall Richard ring,0.07150947
is just knocks it out of the park in this Octavia Spencer she just does,0.1009889
her thing you know I always feel like she's funny and everything but she you,0.14455773
can kind of that's the thing about this movie that I can see the Octavia,0.10424731
Spencer you know she did her like role that she always liked in supporting roles,0.07884412
she's funny and stuff like that like this earlier this year pretty sure she's been,0.24026841
in a lot of stuff this year but earlier this year she was in a,0.07567527
gifted starring Chris Evans and I thought she was really good in that as well,0.074517705
a little supporting role but the thing about this film that for each character even,0.054903764
those supporting characters they have like a nice I don't see arc but they have,0.06414853
nice little character development moments and stuff like that and throughout the whole like first,0.09762961
few scenes that Octavius was with Sally I'm forgetting their their names I think one,0.08149563
of them's Zelda I think in the other one was Lisa or something not sure,0.09320247
I should remember these characters names but and I was even talking to myself about,0.056368116
the movie on the way home and I never remember the names but now I'm,0.058841627
just blanking but even in the beginning with those two characters you can kind of,0.06327464
hear Octavia in the background whereas Ali's doing her thing she's in the background she's,0.10322818
talking about her like husband stuff like that and you know kind of can come,0.15459502
full circle at the end I was really nice to see you know but yeah,0.07944346
and even Doug Jones I feel like he's just one of those actors you don't,0.11072105
really know that he's like in that role but I think I think he did,0.07843785
a great job for what it's worth you know you can't really see that he,0.105649315
did a performance like facial wise you know obviously but overall you can kind of,0.23991583
he did a great job because of that like he was I was gonna say,0.1527371
real quick to that I don't know I think he was he was in a,0.12635899
practical suit I'm not sure that's another thing about this if they have like visuals,0.104562715
effects like CGI it was really great because I was just thinking it was real,0.07345166
like a pr√°cticas a gear model so obviously he that he uses real of practical,0.1519327
effects and something now he's he's uh okay I say how could I say he,0.24158011
really likes using them um so to been anything about her right now or it,0.25802326
was like his suit yeah a little bit I don't think it was and that's,0.18434903
amazing if it wasn't um but anyways Doug Collins did a pretty good job my,0.11659982
gosh and like I said the whole cast I really liked the cast and their,0.13321011
character so like that that's the thing characters you know that uh so here my,0.067366086
little Toro we could talk about him he's just phenomenal in this film he doesn't,0.13642766
started it but he just he just knocked out of the park with everything was,0.14047126
was the the story in in the way it's shot to Scimitar if he's beautiful,0.26254854
to score I really noticed a score in this film and I believe his name,0.07975443
is uh Alexandre de plus or another plus this flat I think not sure how,0.15325786
you spell he says that same but he didn't feel homage on this I think,0.2266069
he did some of the Harry Potter movies and he's worked with forgetting his name,0.049103662
but he did move right a moon moonrise kingdom and he also did mr. Fox,0.08324565
phantom mr. fantastic Fox I think I'm forgetting the director's name but he he's he's,0.1467551
one of my favorites but he the he the composer he'd that he's done a,0.090120606
lot of good scores and this was no different so I've noticed score really early,0.038595196
on to insert ography obviously garam also visually visually you know he focus on visuals,0.11274996
as well you can tell his previous films um but in this film I think,0.08822783
you know sometimes I gotta say that he kind of gets to carry to wait,0.099354826
a little bit with visuals maybe that's what it's like Pacific Rim I enjoyed Pacific,0.07130889
room I own it but a lot of people say you know it's kind of,0.101804815
not up there for in his films but yeah guys I just overall I don't,0.16603763
know what else to say about the movie the the the score was great scimitar,0.10743293
feel directing the cast the story itself I had a great time at the theater,0.05160498
that's something I kind of didn't really expect you know from this these movies is,0.08379707
I love watching movies and these could have been ways for me like more Oxford,0.10054768
ish movies I guess they're really great films and stuff like that but you don't,0.11768514
find yourself at theatre kind of like having fun I guess unless because these are,0.13611476
more like darker films and so like the more more serious films I should say,0.14867964
more drama driven films but this one was a little bit different I was having,0.108253516
fun following these characters in this journey and stuff so overall guys if I had,0.057945624
to rate the shape of water I think I have to give it an 8.5,0.05826122
out of 10 it was just a really great movie I I seems like I'm,0.09644804
giving a lot of movies 8.5 um this year looking like when I look back,0.056780946
at my scores but there's just one scene a real quick that kind of just,0.06454165
kind of came out of nowhere for me you know and in you kind of,0.24547298
involving like some singing I just thought there was a lot of great stuff little,0.0804983
cared little character details and stuff like that a lot of great stuff in a,0.06897258
movie you know with the Richard Jenkins character and his painting it's just a lot,0.09120091
of stuff I really loved about this movie but I don't know I just feel,0.10992534
like at the end of the day like I I just didn't really kind of,0.07758875
I don't know III I'm thinking about that scene way too much but just that,0.11991305
scene kind of took me out you know in so I think that's a good,0.16820936
score in my opinion it's one of my favorites of the year so yeah if,0.06339274
