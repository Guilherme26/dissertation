hello,0.054463096
everyone today,0.033936944
i'll be reviewing the philadelphia story,0.0553003
so the philadelphia story came out in 1940 and was directed by george cucor and this stars catherine hepburn cary grant and james stewart right at the start of this film we see cary grant and catherine hepburn are a married couple who are actually just about to break up and then suddenly the film fast forwards two years later where we see catherine hepburn is arranged to be married to another man a rather rich man,0.08016672
in fact however carrie grant's character he is very much still in love with catherine hepburn's character tracy,0.12241878
it's very obvious,0.07500224
and then we're later introduced to james stewart's character called mike and also this other character called liz,0.051458225
and mike and liz are photographers and they are arranged to go and go and see and photograph tracy's wedding,0.15186186
so this film is one of those classic comedies of the 1930s 1940s and a very innocent type of film very light-hearted,0.102311015
and what i really like about this film is the dialogue because the dialogue is very interesting,0.05877174
in this film all of the characters whenever they're speaking they are very witty,0.081594706
and everything they're saying is very interesting,0.051064238
and they actually do tend to talk quite quickly in this film and this film never really stops when it comes to the characters talking and everybody takes a break now some people might not like that,0.080009095
and i think particularly with modern audiences watching this film it can seem that the characters talk perhaps a bit too much,0.10757304
and maybe say quite a lot,0.07423518
and maybe maybe just talk and talk and talk and never really stop,0.08749534
and in some ways that is true,0.052656945
however everything that these characters say is does come across as very intelligent on screen and very witty,0.107013494
and just the the way these characters communicate with each other the chemistry that i have on screen catherine hepburn is particularly impressive in this films gives a fantastic performance and so does james stewart as well,0.060587145
in fact james stewart,0.099158496
actually won the oscar for best actor for this film,0.10140713
and he really gives a a very impressive and unique performance in this film we don't normally think of james stewart as being an actor who woos the ladies,0.18086816
but in this film he really comes across in that way as opposed to the sort of honest nice guy that he is in other films although he still is a very likable character in this film some people actually think that james stewart won the oscar for this film as consolation for not winning,0.16296896
it for mr,0.0645768
smith goes to washington which came out the previous year,0.07719406
but really what the song focuses on is catherine hepburn she's the main star,0.14946161
and there's three men,0.11564608
in this film who essentially have affection for catherine hepburn's character tracy or almost seem to fall in love with her,0.14886248
so i've got cary grant james stewart and also catherine hepburn's future husband or the man she is hoping to marry in this film draws kitterage,0.11974552
and these three men are very different characters,0.11399327
but they all have something different to say and something different to put on screen and and all have a different input to this film this is one of those films that really doesn't take itself too seriously,0.077072494
there aren't really any dark or evil moments in this film which is something,0.14939508
i like however some people might find this film lacks a bit of energy or maybe doesn't have many interesting scenes in it,0.15332417
but if you view this as a romantic comedy then it really does the job extremely,0.11683367
well everything about this film says romantic comedy,0.1639884
just the way that these characters are talking all the scenes,0.052492738
and although obviously this film came out in 1940,0.20266384
so it won't be as risque in terms of the sexual or nudity or things like that obviously,0.51239103
there's none of that here,0.08242241
but it is often quite suggestive in quite a few scenes with the innuendos which is very cleverly done especially in films of this era,0.097913854
but obviously it doesn't show too much on screen,0.07840331
there are a few scenes or perhaps it's it slightly makes reference to something which is all very cleverly done,0.06044526
so this was the second time that i'd seen this film and i think i liked it quite a bit more this time than i did the first time and it was it was interesting how watching for a second time there were some bits i remembered in certain bits,0.10274885
i didn't however this time i did spend much more time listening to the dialogue and i think the first time i watched it i found the dialogue a bit annoying this time i really appreciate it,0.08080509
i really appreciated all these different lines that these characters have all these different character moments especially with james stewart's character but really catherine hepburn um is the main star and we get a few scenes where she plays her character slightly different because she's a very rich wealthy character,0.05182424
and she tries to come across as slightly different,0.11300486
in a few scenes which is quite amusing,0.15137458
particularly with the photographers when she's first meeting them she's trying to come across as something a bit different,0.15361388
and then we have these other these other two characters known as papa and uncle willie and their identities get switched round,0.07106913
and that's a very funny scene as well we also have a younger girl called diner in this and she is very good as well overall,0.1709039
i think the philadelphia story is a decent romantic comedy,0.11195479
unfortunately it's not going to appeal to everyone especially with the dialogue the way the characters speak in this film,0.10752971
i've read some other reviews,0.05669901
some people might get slightly annoyed by a dialogue in this film and feel like their characters talk too much,0.090663806
i can see that but i personally don't really agree,0.085482806
i think it's an enjoyable film i don't necessarily think it's one of the best romantic comedies of all time,0.08796288
but i can certainly see why it is regarded as a classic particularly with stars like catherine hepburn cary grant and james stewart all in one film together and i personally did find the ending to be a little bit tacky a little bit cheesy,0.15507308
but at the same time it was believable,0.050035816
so i can forgive it for that,0.056860946
and i suppose in these type of films,0.15548523
you want to have an ending like this if the ending was different i i don't know how i would end the film otherwise come to think of it,0.19320877
so overall a very enjoyable film,0.1698609
if you like romantic comedies um especially classic ones in this era then this is probably one of the best ones to watch so i'm gonna give the philadelphia story a rating of eight out of ten,0.113890424
it's an excellent romantic comedy however i myself i don't always enjoy romantic comedies that much so that's probably why i haven't rated it higher,0.14969979
so there we go,0.05063906
