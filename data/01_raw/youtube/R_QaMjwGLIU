to talk spoilers about Mission Impossible fallout is to talk about Henry freakin cavil alright last chance this is the spoiler review you've been warned and they do a really good job teasing it out okay are you still here he's the villain oh and he's such a good villain he is like I've debated about whether or not I wanted to go here but I will he's like Alan Rickman good as a villain uh and I think he like this isn't a role as good as Hans Gruber but I think if someone gave Henry Cavill such a role he could nail it he he is just so good why is he so good because from what I've heard Henry Cavill it's not a nice guy so question for McQuarrie finally put him in his element and he shines I mean think about it right what was the best moment in Justice League evil Superman because that to Henry Cavill is and again the great thing about Mission Impossible followed is how they they let the Henry Cavill villain storyline unfold so in the trailers they let it be known to us that he was an enemy of Ethan Hunt but they made it seem like it was just the CIA versus the IMF you know like you know enter interagency political espionage drama right but then in the actual film like halfway through the movie they clearly telegraphed that Henry Cavill is indeed the villain in his exchange with Angela Bassett the whole audience was kind of like you're are you telling us this like wow and I think that it's a credit to Christopher McQuarrie that he didn't have to follow the rule of three Hitchcock's rule of three is that you have to tell an audience something three times for them to get it you know it can be verbally visually but you have to put it in front of them three times but here in one conversation and I guess it's also a crate to Henry Cavill he does speak very clearly with his American accent right but he was like Oh Angela Bassett you suspected it was an American agent working as a double agent I think it's hunt and then he hands her the phone that we've only seen once before in the bathroom and he gets her off of lark at the lark decoy and that phone was in the bathroom and then when he hands it to Angela Bassett it's a pristine phone and you're like oh my god it's him he's the villain but it's so subtle I wonder if everyone gets it but I was amazed at how crystal-clear it was to me and it turned out to be crystal clear to Angela Bassett too because of course they were able to do an ambush on him with that great underground you know gotcha scene we'll talk about that but that was really cool and then basically for the rest of the movie Henry Cavill plays mission impossible gasps stalk he should have been Gaston I don't know if he can sing but Luke Evans played at being evil or a character that just had a very bad temper and would go out of control the evil calmness of Henry Cavill it's just a wonder to behold I mean and I think you might be a little bit like that in real life no no I think I'm reek aval is just very artistically naive although those do sometimes lead to someone being evil those characteristics my favorite moment of his in the movie I liked almost all of his moments in the movie but the real standout to me like if I were putting together a clip reel of Awesomeness like for movies in general I would include where he [ __ ] his head looking down at crews holding onto the bottom of the elevator and like through the gate it's like one of those wire elevators so they can totally see each other and just Henry Cavill so perfectly Telegraph's like you're so stupid Ethan Hunt I just can't believe you're continuing with this year so I so it would be so easy for me to kill you of course he has a reason not to but it was a really fabulous moment I loved it so much and I know a lot of you want this to lead to a Man of Steel too but unless it's injustice the injustice storyline with an evil super man turned bad which would be amazing and Henry Cavill would do such a good job with it but I I don't honestly I just don't see that happening especially with where Warner Brothers is now I don't know and also the contract problems I mean maybe I just saw based on what I'm seeing here and how good Henry Cavill is I don't really think that he can play a good guy to be honest with you and unfortunately Chris Evans is Captain America has taken that space so I would love to explore evil Superman but I don't think Warner Brothers is gonna do that so Henry Cavill every cab is gonna look out for him Cavill so this is manager Danny Garcia the rocks ex-wife and business partner and they should be going after roles or he plays a villain going forward and he I think his star I think his star would grow because that's clearly what he is meant to do like if if Alan Rickman was gonna be in a role or maybe you know Patrick Wilson often plays the villain he's doing so well in Aquaman those type of roles that's what Henry Cavill should be doing because it would be excellent but he sure as heck ain't gonna make any more Mission Impossible movies cuz they killed that dude Tom Cruise is like fine it's fine if you want to have him taller than me throughout the entire film but there's no way he's gonna make it out of this movie alive like the whole audience again was in shock because it's like he was such a great villain do you really just kill him and you left Solomon Lane alive Solomon light is played out I would much prefer to see Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise continue to go after each other it's like to two different sides of the same coin I think that would be great but you know the look on Tom Cruise's face when he killed Henry Cavill he's like these are my movies it was just it was really funny because of their cuz of the ball and I think maybe that being taken out of the movie consistently and thinking about the behind the scenes stuff is why maybe people aren't totally getting into it because I'm disappointed know what this is it projected to open at and around like mid 50 mid 50s we'll talk about the story aspect too I have another theory but first I want to rank the action sequences so by far and away the best one is actually the bathroom fight I didn't I said Paris car chase was my favorite of Tom Cruise's stunts but this was like a typical action sequence except it wasn't it was the perfect action sequence we've seen a lot of bathroom fights in action movies right but this one just had everything and an action suspense humor they kept levelling up and laying yang by the way as that lark deep decoy did a great job going toe to toe with both Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill simultaneously they were like who is this guy and the audience was like who is this guy and then the look on leaing Yang's face was like I'm Leung yang damn it was just fantastic it was edited it was also edited extremely well but my favorite moment was and I loved Rebecca Ferguson showed up right that was so cool but my favorite moment was all the blood on the floor and they kept almost slipping on it that just was a really nice touch I loved it and I like that realistic angle of spy work it's messy yeah well I also want Henry Cavill is like forget extraction we're gonna need a we're gonna need cleanup or something that was great I love that then the Paris car chase which actually the more I thought about it I realized it was multi-leveled you know like it started out with the acquiring Solomon Lane then it turned into a truck chase then it was a motorcycle chase and then it was Tom Cruise in a car and I liked that stuff with the French policewoman how that played out although Tom Cruise is on I mean of course he's the hero but you know it's a real life I mean I think he should get a lot a lot of credit for how I mean I think the way you played it was very good and he's lucky that that French policewoman wasn't like you know some particularly women unfortunately will be like but it's still legal what you're doing sir she was like he saved my life I'm just gonna let this play out right I mean she should have just walked away I don't know why you did that doesn't carry a badge I mean I guess someone else though in the group could have had a badge he was undercover but maybe someone else could have had a badge I think they could have planned for that eventuality you know you'd think maybe that might come up but anyway that they're all in a car and Rebecca Ferguson is chasing them on a motorcycle it was great I loved Rebecca Ferguson was on the motorcycle and the wind was going through the columns I thought that was so cool like though like you know just she was going so fast I thought that was so cool and then when Tom Cruise went down the stairs on this on with the car down the steps like the way he turned around that was great I mean the whole thing was not only very well staged I mean they just kept this chase going I'm especially when he took the knife out he managed to you were like he's gonna hide in the shrubbery of course we're gonna find him but there was a way down to the canals underneath that was great so cool so I like that but then also they showed off Paris beautifully from the Arc de Triomphe to the small streets where it's hard to drive and sure enough their truck gets jammed I couldn't tell if that was intentional or not but I loved it they kept oh it must have been because their motorcycles were waiting for them but I loved that they kept going they really without even skipping a beat they're like ok kick out the windshield keep going I loved it that next the helicopter oh by the way I wanted to say that when the convoy was going and they had the diversion of that truck / to divert them down the way the direction they wanted them to go in I couldn't believe it the con the convoy wasn't like this seems really obvious as a way to divert us there's no way I'm taking the obvious route I was stopped or I would have backed up or I don't know why I would not have gone down the route that I so clearly should go down cuz it's a trap alright so next up the helicopter chase like the Paris car chase the real thrill here is seeing Cruz in the middle of all these shots like doing it himself that that's really cool also on a side note I loved when he was running across that bridge to chase after cavil like when I guess I'll put the footrace in here - I thought the footrace was really really well done I also cuz you're like oh yeah you don't want to run against Tom Cruise he's Tom Cruise running is what he does so that was so cool and I like the way they were running all the way through through London in this case and they were they ran into a funeral and then he was going through buildings and everything and I liked what they had this gorgeous shot of him running across a bridge it was just like just in the middle of like the London landscape with them a pedestrian bridge in the background it was really really well done then the helicopter chase so here it was it was great to see Oh so Henry Cavill riding in and then flailing around his own helicopter I also like the gag when Tom Cruise climbed in and there was another guy dressed like Henry Cavill also caught over the moustache and Tom Cruise is like his character is like what the hell it's funny that I keep calling him Tom Cruise instead of Ethan Hunt and I think that's very much you know the movies the movie made that choice and now they have to live with it but I thought that was hilarious and also it was not only here also excellently choreographed and a fight with very high stakes starts out in the air goes through the ground they're still throwing punches that was great but I like the way they had it with them son him having to get the trigger off of the the countdown device Tom Cruise and then his team simultaneously defusing not one but two nukes at the same time in two different groups so you have ving rhames and michele monic and having a really nice quiet diffusion scenario with like you know almost like it's like a surgeon like a like surgery and that was great cuz of course she's a doctor and they had some really nice I had a really nice exchange with each other really good heart between those two but then you also have Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg with the other nuke with Solomon Lane and they have a cool suspenseful action sequence going there and I love the Rebecca Ferguson had the same simon pegg although he wasn't a damsel in distress either he's just not as well trained in fighting as she is and that was they very much seen like team members and I really really liked that it was just all of it made for a wonderfully nuanced third act really really well constructed and then last the halo jump I mean the suits were cool and Christopher McQuarrie at the press screening told us that they were designed specifically for this so that you could see everyone's face that all the tech that everyone wears and the in the halo jump scene had to be designed specifically for this movie for the needs that they had but otherwise I just thought I was a little boring like it was cool I went through a lightning storm and the Henry Cavill got hit by lightning that was a fun I was a neat moment but I think that it could have been more visually interesting in that regard and I just I thought it was a little boring like when I was watching and I was like didn't think I told us how hard it was to film it and they had only three minutes to get the shot each day because they wanted to film it dusk or whatever and I don't really I think this scene wasn't worth the effort to be honest with you and also Ethan Hunt it was frustrating actually to see him trying so hard to save someone who not only clearly wouldn't save him but you know you kind of were like it's either felon you know it's not good you know it was just crazy like he was I mean Ethan Hunt is a really cool stand-up guy now on that note at the end of the movie Ethan Hunt seemed tired well duh right but what I mean is is that he nominally was physically tired but he seemed emotionally tired of this spy game of no-one trusting him having to do everything by himself often being by himself you know I think not you know he has a lot of teammates and you know friends you know work friends but I think he's often isolated in terms of his belief and that will work out right unlike so who has to do it Ethan Hunt has to do it and I think since they chose to play it this way with him being so exhausted and they had Henry kill cavil kill Alec Baldwin maybe it's time for Ethan Hunt to lead the IMF I mean I don't think Cruz would ever be willing to do it but maybe I'll have no choice and he could still be in the field and lead and I would love to see some other characters like Rebecca Ferguson take up some of the action sequences but I think that after he broke his ankle doing a stunt and the insurance company it seems had to pony up seventy million dollars in coverage I don't know if they'll ever let crews do a stunt his own stunts again so this might be the only direction they can go in and I think it would actually be beneficial to the series I'm not saying Tom Cruise shouldn't still be the star of Mission Impossible I think he should be but I think he can I think he could stand to nice to think he shouldn't killed Henry Cavill off and I think he could stand to share a little bit more space and I think it would only improve him and I think he's got a look at the box office numbers we'll see what they actually end up being but that chill alarm him and showed him showing him that you know maybe he is doing something a little bit wrong because this movie deserves better box office numbers quite frankly and as for the actual story the movie starts out a little bit like like an old-school video game with the mission presented almost directly to the audience which was both fun and a bit corny also the wolf blitzer gag was super corny although to the movies credit I only figured out that's what they were doing just like a few seconds before it even that I thought Wolf Blitzer was just working with the IMF I was like woo they flew Wolf Blitzer out there I totally didn't I forgot that they were using how like Halloween masks and speaking of Halloween masks I loved Henry Cavill disdain for them he's like you guys are so stupid with your Halloween masks and they brilliantly brilliantly use that to trick him and when he and I love the moment when he says it he's like you're stupid Halloween masks he brings it up again and then as he says it he's like holy crap is that really Solomon Lane no it's Benjy in a Halloween mask and you damn kids you know scooby-doo like it was just a great moment and come to think of it I think the lame wolf blitzer moment earlier does a great job of setting this up right like it seems lame until suddenly it's very very cool so I know that was great oh so the opening credits by the way ruined West Bentley being in the film I was watching the opening credits and I was like West Bentley who's he gonna be for a while I thought maybe he'd be like one of the members like one of the Apostles or something but I really liked him showing up as Michelle Monica's husband you could feel the warmth of their relationship and the lives that they had and I think that was both of them Michelle Michelle monoghan and West belly they both did a great job I mean the nice guy Ness was just rating off of what's Bentley like you wouldn't believe or maybe you wouldn't believe it but he just seemed like wow I think anybody would be like that awesome like no matter what he did you'd be like he's so cool and in this case he took the life that Ethan Hunt turned down and I really could feel that in that scene I loved that you know the road not traveled and you can feel how much it hurt Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and maybe you know as you can see I'm referring to him and Ethan Hunt in this scenario and maybe if these movies were more story based these Mission Impossible movies the road not taken' would have been an interesting idea to explore further perhaps throughout the entire film but maybe in the next movie right as I said I think Christopher McQuarrie has done all that he can here and they should bring in somebody else and hopefully that person recognizes that these movies maybe aren't as successful because audiences don't emotionally connect with the character of Ethan Hunt instead they spend the movie being in awe of Tom Cruise and hey the guy's awfully impressive he deserves our our awe right I mean and this might be the ultimate Tom Cruise movie but I'd like to add that Tom Cruise is very funny very charming very handsome and a very good actor he's more than just stunts and I think it would serve him well to remember that I mean he's made a lot of movies don't involve any stunts but he seems to have drifted away from that maybe you might want to consider circling back and bringing that element into these movies all right so that's my review my spoiler review of Mission Impossible fallout I'm very excited to discuss the movie with you down below both with you but you thought of it and what you would do to improve it even if you think it's a perfect movie but you can't argue with the lackluster box office especially if it does open as expected so I think that's a good exercise from a business perspective to look at these movies from the perspective and the needs of the studio and also Tom Cruise right I mean he's got to know he's got to keep growing this thing if he wants it to stick around for even longer than it has which in itself is impressive so again share those thoughts down below and of course as always you can check out some more videos right now [Music]
