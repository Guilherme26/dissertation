"Starwars The Last Jedi was directed by Rian Johnson, and stars a whole bunch of people and porks"
"And it's about Rafe in Poe, Luke Leia Kylo, and a whole bunch of Star Wars folk on a big adventure"
And that's all I'm gonna say
you should just go see it
I'm not saying anything else
Joking aside
"If you saw the Force Awakens, you know that it quite literally ended with a cliffhanger, Rey extending that lightsaber out to Luke and us wondering what he's gonna do with it"
"This film answers that question and a lot of other questions, and has a lot of fun doing it and I had a blast watching The Last Jedi"
This is a really really damn entertaining Star Wars movie and one with a unique voice
Brian Johnson is able to direct this film
"and please, I'm sure the vast majority of Star Wars fans"
but his voice is not lost in the shuffle
I've seen all of his films
I've been a fan of his ever since Brick
That was one of the very first movies on my channel that I gave an A+ to my highest rating
"The vision that he has shown in films like Brick and Looper and even the Brothers Bloom, is very much so present here"
"he has a great knack for filming terrific action sequences, and his voice and his humor are ever-present in this film"
It's a very funny movie
"Just like The Force Awakens was a lot of great jokes, and none of them feel like they're at the expense of the characters"
"It doesn't feel like they're referencing things either, just to reference them"
"Sure there are winks and nods and references, But to ask the eighth film in a saga to act like the others didn't even exist, I think is unfair, but the fanservice in the Last Jedi does not come at an expense to the story"
It doesn't feel like a throwaway moment like in Rogue One where we saw at C-3po Just going
"Oh yes, I'm in this movie because I'm in every Star Wars movie and we couldn't have it not be in this"
"It doesn't feel like the fanservice in The Last Jedi is there because? oh yeah, I remember that Star Wars thing"
"Johnson's love for Star Wars and for these characters shines through, but also ways that he questions certain things that have become established in Star Wars"
"I'll talk more about this in my spoiler review, but the film does bring up things about previous Star Wars stories and asks questions that I think people walking into this universe like our new characters would logically want to know about, And the film has a surprising way of exploring these questions"
Let's talk a little bit about the performances
Daisy Ridley once again is proving to be an excellent choice As Rey
She's terrific in the action sequences and the dramatic stuff
She's an incredible actress
John Boyega once again amazing his fin
"Oh boy, let's talk about Carrie Fisher"
This was tough
"This was really hard for me, actually, because she was kind of a childhood hero of mine and of course, when she passed away, this was one of the the real celebrity deaths that actually kind of affected me And it was"
"It was tough seeing her in this film, but I think they did a great job with her character and it has some truly satisfying moments And it was just it was really nice to see her on screen and she was great in this movie"
"Mark Hamill is the best he has ever been, has Luke Skywalker and this is easily his best performance"
He is magnificent in this film
Every single scene with him was awesome
He was really really good
"This is a character as I said, dealing with quite a bit"
"Obviously, he has secluded himself on this island, and so some history has led to that, and the exploration of that in this film was wonderful, Hamill"
You really knocked it out of the park
You gave me everything I wanted in a Luke Skywalker and everything I didn't know I wanted
I'm sure has a lot of you know
He has said that he was kind of surprised by the direction Rian Johnson took and I can see why and it definitely paid off
I think this is a very unique vision and that's what I'll say for now until the spoiler review
This is definitely definitely different when it comes to his character
Johnson has also done something with the action sequences
"in particular, anything involving a lightsaber that I have wanted"
for ever my favorite shots
"Any lightsaber battles are always the head-to-toe wides, the beautiful grand master shots that feature our heroes, and you can see their entire body, the choreography and it just feels incredibly epic"
The lightsaber sequences in this film have some of the most beautiful wide shots I have ever seen
It's very apparent how much Ryan Johnson has been inspired by Japanese films by samurai films
Anime
It all feels very much so like the Jedi are almost samurai
"And if I'm wrong, and that wasn't what he was going for, that's what I saw and some of the imagery here is gorgeous"
The action sequences are some of my favorite that I've seen in a Star Wars movie
They're really really good
"Adam Driver, as Kylo, Ren continues to be very compelling"
A terrific performance
He and Force Awakens I thought was a very conflicted and deep character
Not your average villain
He wasn't done yet
He wasn't fully trained
He wasn't ready
"He had angry, deep-seated emotion that really shone through in his work, and he is amazing here"
and this film continues to deepen Kylo Ren's legacy in ways that I cannot wait to talk about in the spoiler review
"Really satisfied with everything they did in this movie with every major character, Oscar Isaac is once again amazing as Po"
Such a likable presence
"Let's talk about Finn and Rose, because this leads me into my issues with the last Jedi"
"There's a storyline here that involves these characters, Finn and Rose, that feels like an extended short film"
Almost like the movie just stops and becomes something else
Something else
I didn't really enjoy all that much
It's a sequence on another world that feels almost too much like Earth
"This place they go, just did not feel like a galaxy far far away"
"It felt like a place you might see here on Earth, just with a few more exotic creatures, But it wasn't just the setting"
"it was the fact that it basically screeched the story to a halt, and every time it cut back to them, I was like Okay"
"Is this gonna get more interesting here? Is this gonna get better? Reminded me of in the Phantom Menace documentary When George Lucas had just seen The Phantom Menace for the first time, and you see him sitting there in the theater, agonizing over the fact that he can't remove anything because it all connects and he's just kind of like"
"Oh boy, Well, Rick, what do we do? I can't really remove any of that stuff because they're all kind of you know"
interweaves
"Oh boy, you know, a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing, Rick, you know, Oh boy, Jar Jar is the key to all of this jokes"
"Aside this sequence with Finn and Rose, It's just too far along and the things that they have to do"
"Sure it effects the plot later, but they're just should have been an easier and quicker way to do some of these things, because it feels like a detour"
an unnecessary detour
"it reminded me of in Avengers Age of Ultron When Thor goes off looking for that pool, you're just like What? All right"
"Unfortunately, this sequence is necessary to set up some things that you're supposed to care about later and I just didn't"
"we'll talk more about that in the spoiler review, But that is my one major issue with the Last Jedi That 20 to 30 minutes that are combined This Finn storyline Now, Obviously it's not just a 30 minute chunk of the movie"
It's spread out over the film
"But it's one of those things like I said, where you're going back to this place and you're like, Yeah, this could be better"
Pushing all that aside
I honestly love the Last Jedi
I had a really great time with this movie
I think it has some of the best action sequences in the entire saga
It has some of the best performances in the entire saga
It has a compelling and conflicted villain and it has tons of surprises
There are a lot of things that happen
I did not expect
"I'm not the type of person who likes to go in speculating, though, so that could be different for you"
I don't like to sit here and make up theories and guess and try to predict things
"I like to go in, just like I can't wait to experience this"
"I also like John Williams score this time around, more than I did for the Force Awakens"
"His music, of course, is always going to be really good, but his score for The Force Away was one of my least favorites"
It just felt a little rushed
This one feels better
It's like he had more time
Let's talk about porks real quick
They're adorable
They're amazing and they're not annoying
"Thank God, Captain Tarpals"
never forget Bb-8 once again has a lot of moments to shine
"Chewie does as well as does the Millennium Falcon, some really awesome Millennium Falcon sequences"
I honestly love this film
"I don't know about where it stands for me, but the Force Awakens I want to see it again"
Let me see it this Thursday
We'll do a spoiler review
"After that, I think I'll be able to give you my official ranking of where this fits in"
but it is a damn good Star Wars movie
There are a lot of emotional moments that I am looking forward to talking to you more about in the spoiler review
"If this review seems a little vague, it's because I feel like that's what you would prefer"
"we'll talk more about that after the film is released, but rest assured, this movie made me really happy"
I'm gonna give the Last Jedi and A - definitely better than Rogue One
I had characters that I actually cared about
a story that felt like it was beginning middle and end made by one person
It didn't feel like an assembly line product
It didn't feel like another movie we've already seen
It's structurally its own thing
"Sure, there are a few little beats here and there where you might be like"
I've seen that before
"I've seen that before, but this is definitely made by somebody with a unique voice, Rian Johnson, and I think he did a damn good job"
I'm looking forward to seeing it again
I can't wait for you guys to see it
"Thank you so much as always for watching, and if you like this, you can click right here and get Steppen eyes"
