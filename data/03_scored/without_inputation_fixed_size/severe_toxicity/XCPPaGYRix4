the best movies that i've seen in a long time and the basic story is,0.01649323
a young woman who's been i think she was like in a nunnery or something,0.14368765
like she was going to be a nun um she gets word that her sister,0.05553485
has passed away and she needs to come home because they need to marry her,0.085819334
off because this was back in the days when they would marry the daughter off,0.060916852
to a man who could give the family status or you know he had a,0.021768134
lot of like great wealth so they since the daughter had died they needed this,0.20595816
other daughter to come back to be given away so she comes back we don't,0.07900652
really see her until a little bit later in the movie and they hire someone,0.14735281
and i guess back in those days they hire um someone to paint your portrait,0.06255986
to send to the potential suitor husband so they hired this girl i believe her,0.076696336
name is marianne and she comes and basically the story rolls out from there it,0.016165959
was just the main two actresses were so good they're french actresses i looked them,0.1376285
up to see if i had seen them anything and i hadn't and they were,0.04249393
just so good and there might be some light spoilers here um in the next,0.023160364
part i'm getting into so there is a lesbian relationship in this film and i,0.28244767

basically forcing her and she falls the the daughter falls in love with the girl,0.18830751
who came to paint her portrait and you would think like oh is that going,0.049814273
to be cheesy like it's based in like the seaside like scenic town in france,0.2184177
and um but it's just so well written and so well done and by the,0.02137102
end of the movie you just want them and their love to succeed and i,0.17741312
feel like this movie it's obviously based around um this painter and her view of,0.03082993
this world and the um this girl that she's fallen in love with and the,0.16629192
whole movie is beautifully shot it looks like every shot in the film looks like,0.14766744
a painting and i know they had to have done that on purpose but it,0.026143048
was just gorgeous to watch every single scene whoever the cinematographer was in this was,0.0580406
a plus because it it was beautiful and i it's one of those movies i,0.06406051
bought i watched this like maybe like a week or so ago and it has,0.020204289
completely stuck with me and i can't get i can't get some of the imagery,0.07157177
and scenes out of my head and the ending is so i'm not giving too,0.15753278
much away but i'm going to say how the ending made me feel so if,0.10061701
you don't want to kind of know like the like what could possibly happen like,0.025181193
you could try to figure it out don't watch this part but um the ending,0.05986786
is so heart-wrenching and sad and i just like i couldn't believe like i usually,0.023361249
don't cry that much during movies but i like sobbed at the end of this,0.040310793
movie and there are some call backs and there's this final scene and again i'm,0.02240405
not going to spoil anything but there's a final scene with one character and it,0.0244302
just stays the shot stays on the character and it's just like oh my gosh,0.08017392
i'm seeing this person's raw emotions and it was like almost too overwhelming and it,0.10498128
felt very real like you're seeing something you're really not supposed to be seeing and,0.04851783
you feel like oh i'm like looking into this person's like soul and seeing all,0.10473516
the intimate workings and i'm like oh but um it's such a good movie if,0.034499086
