so please subscribe please stay in tune so that you can see the videos when I put out you know the vlogs of my entire trip in Mexico I cannot wait I wish I could go tomorrow now to get into a few spoilers just a few thoughts that I wanted to say about the movie that couldn't really say you know without spoiling the movie so if you haven't seen it,0.0991625
and you don't want spoilers stop the video,0.24239041
now you did do whatever you have to do mute it,0.20312528
and just watch me talk like this,0.07415606
alright whatever you have to do here come the spoilers the main motivation was that you know Miguel found out that his great great grandfather or he knew that his great great grandfather was a musician and that that was that the music was in his blood,0.15461917
and that's part of the reason why he wanted to go on to be a musician himself,0.10187537
now he thought that this musician because of the guitar in the picture was a musician de la Cruz who has who's the greatest singer in Mexican history in the movie he has the signature guitar that actually the end of the guitar replicates,0.10720133
one of the the skulls that you know that we see you know on the faces of people during the festivals of the Adela's Muertos and so he's like okay,0.31089434
then the Cruz is is my great-great grandfather,0.08764498
I know I'm destined to do the music de la Cruz's key,0.10781312
phrase was you know go in and get your destiny,0.15570661
I'm sorry I can't remember exactly what he said but basically go out and get your destiny you know go out and take your what's yours go out and chase your dreams and accomplish them,0.13792215
and Miguel lived by that now once he reaches the land of the dead,0.17407875
he goes in there because he stole you know guitar,0.44454798
and when you steal from the dead you end up transferring into that realm so he goes into that realm looking for the looking for de la Cruz so that he could get his blessings to be a musician back,0.46622145
you know in on earth in the physical realm he sees all that,0.12435553
he sees his great great grandmother,0.19549738
and he sees a lot of the family that he had pictures of and they are like no,0.10130152
no,0.06626663
no,0.06626663
there's no way that we're gonna give you our blessings to be a musician no music in our family okay,0.11188275
so he meets a man named Hector Hector has been forgotten by pretty much all of his family,0.31089434
and he's just hoping that his daughter can maintain his memory in that if he could get back just one time to the physical,0.12774155
world during the holiday to see his daughter that would make his world he'd be able to you know disappear and go off into the unknown regions and be happy,0.35681838
so he meets up with Miguel and they make a deal you know okay,0.07651321
I'll help,0.04526031
you find a la Cruz I know I'm if I help you find a la Cruz you have to take this picture of me back to my daughter,0.3100993
so that she could remember me forever now Darren there's a twist in the in the film where he realizes that,0.07096034
and this was such a great twist,0.054765347
in the story great excellent writing to where Hector actually ends up being his father and the reason why he never returned after he left,0.09241918
you know his Hector's empty left Miguel his great great grandmother that he was murdered by de la Cruz who was Miguel's hero,0.44226754
so Miguel thinks his great great grandfather who was his hero is a murderer who's not only a murderer,0.69542736
but he's a faker,0.7796476
he's a he's a total fraud,0.70609206
he's not actually the greatest musician he actually took all of these songs from Hector he stole the songs from Hector and then murdered Hector so that he could take these take this music and go off and become you know known as the greatest singer in the world,0.44223702
so at that point Miguel is totally crushed however once they clarify the story he realizes that hold on Hector is the guy that left his family and his daughter of course is Coco who of course is Miguel's great-great-great grandmother and then he realized that Hector is his great great grandfather he ends up getting you know the blessings of the entire family including his great-great grandmother they he gets back to the physical world,0.14952223
and this is the super touching part is gonna make you cry tears of joy when Miguel starts playing,0.22261262
remember me for his for his great-grandmother Coco who's begins to remember her father who sang that to her when she was just a young child just a young baby and she pulls out the picture of him there it had his face torn off before she reattaches that portion,0.31089434
and now of course he'll be remembered ever we fast forward to the next year a dia de los muertos and we see you know Hector and his wife and they're all dancing together and happy and enjoying Tom,0.18821871
and it was just a beautiful moment made me drop a tear made the gentleman next to me he was crying everyone in the theater is emotional,0.1527335
and it's great,0.06407735
I'm so happy you know that that this film is doing so well especially from so much that I've heard from my Mexican brothers and sisters you were right,0.08035519
you steer me in the right direction,0.24007303
this was a great film one of the greatest picture our films of all time,0.08153902
let me know how you feel about it down in the comments I kind of already know how you feel,0.13735181
it's your man king not be the great be great and life and life will be great too you see a seal and a la vita è la Vida Sara grandiose apparenty creativity abundance and prosperity to all and I'm out,0.5154597
