what's going on people Mike see town here where I'm gonna be discussing the new,0.11745457
Jordan Peele film us before I get into that I want to say that I,0.15449516
reviewed this on the frames-per-second podcast so make sure you guys go check that out,0.0694069
link will be down there but I also wanted to make a video about this,0.077227876
- jumping into it us is the second horror film from Jordan Peele third film,0.11892417
in general as he also did Keanu but he was also known for his jokey,0.11560972
and Peele but I've never actually seen that show I didn't know anything about this,0.0873039
guy until he did get out which I loved which I also reviewed so I'll,0.11089812
link that down there as well but because I love get out so much I,0.12616457
had really really high expectations for this one and before we get into this review,0.07614798
there will be spoilers so if you have not seen the movie turn this off,0.13431203
go watch the movie and then come back so us is the story of Adelaide,0.0916132
played by Lupita Nyong'o her husband Gabe played by Winston Duke and their two children,0.15410183
Jason and Zora they go up to Santa Cruz California to their vacation home to,0.09048237
kind of chill out but while there they encountered their doppelgangers and a whole lot,0.15137109
of crazy happens I look like I need to tell you the entire story if,0.29311064
you saw it you know it if you didn't see it you need to go,0.103173986
watch it but I think the main part of the story evolved around who the,0.07703754
doppelgangers or the tethered are the tethered or group that lives underground they're in some,0.14196691
way tied to their above-ground counterparts and what the above-ground twins do is mimicked by,0.1062245
the tethered no matter how weird or awkward it is later in the film we,0.0712636
come to find out that the tethered are a scientific experiment in cloning that's why,0.07883783
we see so many rabbits and at first I thought it was because rabbits were,0.07289908
some of the first animals to be cloned but I was actually wrong about that,0.1194891
I now think it's just because rabbits reproduce so rapidly so it makes sense to,0.16725065
use them especially if we're talking about feeding the other tethers anyway the scientists moved,0.14245366
on from cloning animals and were semi-successful in cloning the humans they were identical counterparts,0.11187552
to their above-ground twins except they weren't able to talk never really explains why but,0.15497498
I kind of have an idea we'll get to that later but at some point,0.071029626
the tethered decide that they're gonna go up of ground because they're tired of living,0.18307382
below ground and living a relatively shitty life while their above-ground twins are living great,0.7706434
lives so they decide to come above Brown and start murdering their twins with scissors,0.62206066
so let me say I loved this movie while I was excited to see it,0.11728414
I was also a bit nervous I didn't want this to be drastically worse then,0.15163305
get out and then Jordan peel is looked at as a one-hit wonder and then,0.1007427
his career within horror movies is over but even outside of looking at the symbolism,0.16730136
which we'll get into I thought this was a very entertaining movie it had plenty,0.09406999
of drama it had some comedy but it was it was tense and it definitely,0.099003576
kept you on the edge of your seat was the perfect film no it was,0.14076142
not I didn't have a new small issues with it if he listened to the,0.057163943
podcast you'll know that one of my issues with the movie was game the father,0.09266914
he was incredibly annoying throughout this movie and I understand that he was written this,0.48674807
way on purpose as a way to prop up Lupita nyong'o's character or maybe even,0.07118622
to prop up black women in general um but after shooting the podcast and driving,0.5154597
home and thinking about it more I now realized that he was kind of representing,0.09463277
how women are treated in horror movies they're looked at as dumb they're looked at,0.8606264
as useless as pointless and this kind of made me think about the part where,0.6050431
he's kind of trying to sexualize the situation by laying on the bed and kind,0.5524872
of spreading his legs yeah that's what women would do in horror movies you know,0.69542736
and I was thinking before that it was too much that it was too obvious,0.09519377
that he's this this big buffoon who gets hit in the leg one time and,0.810187
he spends the rest of the movie kind of whining and crying and crawling on,0.52129996
the ground making dumb jokes at completely inopportune times and yeah that's how women are,0.8060606
in horror movies I feel like Jordan Peele was giving us a taste of our,0.11889141
own medicine and yes it was extremely annoying but now I see that that was,0.14974587
probably the whole point so I feel like he did his job there and that,0.066478275
part no longer bothers me I also feel like they should have left out the,0.09476662
part that definitively tells us that a delay was switched out I think could have,0.057965953
left that to us to figure out you know one example I gave on podcast,0.098801516
was Deckard from Blade Runner you know the movie gives slight implications that may imply,0.08151116
that that Deckard is actually a replicant but it doesn't say for sure so this,0.14991908
gives us years of wandering and rewatching and discussing and it contributes to the cult,0.11264653
status of that film and I think without giving us the answer so definitively the,0.06070559
idea of Adelaide being a tethered would give us the same feeling that Deckard being,0.19644101
a replicant did but there's another idea that wasn't definitively given that I feel like,0.05525059
could give us that same feeling but we'll get to that in a minute my,0.07704391
only other issue was the impracticality of certain things like how would cloning Adelaide and,0.08743097
Gabe result in their kids being exact clones it would be different if Adelaide and,0.10059864
her clone red hadn't actually given birth to the kids but they did the kids,0.12964278
weren't cloned later on so it didn't really make sense but those are extremely small,0.103807576
gripes because I'm totally fine with suspending disbelief for within horror movies especially if I,0.20062687
really enjoyed the film now let's talk about the details of the film so I,0.0447839
did love this movie when I first left the theater I was kind of mad,0.19516313
on the whole thing I thought it was cool and I thought it was a,0.05460703
fun ride but it didn't really click I didn't really get it I had to,0.05959463
think about it long and hard on my ride home and that's when things started,0.115750544
to come together and the more they came together the more I loved this movie,0.073295675
once I started to think about the details of the story my mind started going,0.05523536
crazy so we all know that Adelaide was switched out with her underground clone so,0.34295505
when you think back to the beginning how when young Adelaide was found she wouldn't,0.062631235
talk and that's because the tethered don't talk Adelaide had to learn how to talk,0.103637375
to you she also tells Kitty the mom of the white family they're friends with,0.28479928
that she has a hard time talking to people again because The Temper don't talk,0.15269227
even though you'd think that she'd kind of be over that by now as she's,0.11094429
been above-ground for what we could guess would be at least 20 years also there's,0.056164056
the scene in the car where she's teaching her son Jason how to snap along,0.10391164
- I got five on it I noticed while watching that that she was totally,0.12462151
off beat and I thought that maybe it was just me being too critical and,0.15061742
that it wasn't a big deal but it is actually a big deal because she's,0.11071759
offbeat due to the fact that she's not of this world her her wiring isn't,0.21377915
like ours so even though she's able to pretend with certain things other things just,0.15363999
don't connect for another thing that I mentioned on the frame for second podcast review,0.06919874
about this is my idea that Jason the son was also a tethered I can't,0.09454719
say for certain but many things this movie gave me this impression once I started,0.08058757
to think back on it first off when he's on the beach he's not building,0.09546955
a sandcastle he's building a sand tunnel and it didn't connect at first but it,0.08803962
does once the movies over and you look back at everything just like when Jason,0.08351273
says certain things like kiss my anus and is his parents are like where the,0.9327973
hell did you get that from and then they say he's been acting weird since,0.64932984
the previous summer but they simply think it's because his grandmother died I think it's,0.1351227
because he was switched out that previous summer there's also the thing about the magic,0.050930656
trick toy that he has he says he remembers playing with it but he doesn't,0.15723607
remember what it does and that's because he doesn't know but because his above-ground twin,0.2006231
was playing with it he sort of knows how it works but when we look,0.05726172
at Jason's tethered his face is all burned up and I think that's because while,0.5543589
this Jason was above-ground playing with the little toy his twin was below ground mimicking,0.1789558
him but he was playing with matches and he ends up burning his face I,0.62995714
also think another indication of Jason being switched out is he's the first to say,0.07662607
it's us when the tennard show up he seems to be the least freaked out,0.10848882
at first you know Adelaide is so weirded out because I think she doesn't really,0.1351035
remember that she's a tethered because it happened so long ago she it starts to,0.11237198
come back to her later on in the movie but it's been so recent with,0.114919454
Jason that he knows the whole time but at the end when Adelaide looks back,0.065225944
at Jason and she gives him that kind of sinister smile that kind of tells,0.31089434
the audience that she's a tethered Jason doesn't say anything he just lowers his mask,0.16245331
kind of indicating that he's going back to masking the fact that he's a tethered,0.16989814
to now let's talk a bit about the symbolism in this movie the first big,0.101702146
one that we see is the homeless guy holding the sign that says Jeremiah 11,0.09351789
you know there are many interpretations of this verse depending on which version of the,0.051571663
Bible that you're reading but I found this one and I think it seems to,0.10626305
fit the movie the most behold I'm bringing disaster and suffering on them which they,0.32754096
will not be able to escape though they cry to me I will not listen,0.15028745
to them the interesting thing is the other places the 11:11 appear the attack also,0.15513174
seems to happen at 11:11 p.m. but one of them that kind of me up,0.18173148
was during the fair in 1986 when the fathers playing whack-a-mole the guy that hands,0.18770033
in the ticket is wearing a black flag shirt so me being a nerdy punk,0.48658755
of course I noticed that and I'm like no that's pretty cool kind of like,0.109441
a random reference until later we see one of the real light twins in the,0.056742687
Tyler family the white family they're wearing a black flag t-shirt and I noticed that,0.40194488
and it took me forever to figure out why you know I know a bit,0.07375543
about black flag but I was never a big fan of theirs so I was,0.116623886
looking at songs and song titles trying to figure this out until I looked at,0.039935075
the logo it had a huge dub moment for bars 11:11 such a dope little,0.38105872
nugget for Jordan Peele to throw in there the significance of eleven eleven outside the,0.3310451
verse itself saying that the tethered are bringing evil onto the world and they won't,0.24117793
be stopped I think the number eleven eleven is obviously a take on the whole,0.105180725
twin thing you know eleven eleven is the same no matter how you flip it,0.16157286
the scissors I knew there had to be a reason as to why they were,0.083737224
using scissors to attack people but I couldn't figure it out until the scene where,0.4148507
red cuts the paper dolls then it dawned on me that the scissors were a,0.12720697
representation of severing the above ground people from their tethered twins that's why they specifically,0.14879948
use the scissors to kill them this is them breaking that connection between the tethered,0.7459124
and the above-ground people now why they specifically killed people by stabbing them in the,0.727129
necks especially with the Tyler family that part kind of confused me so if anybody,0.21507686
has any ideas on that please drop a comment down there Hands Across America so,0.13816167
this was an 80s campaign that I'm actually old enough to remember it was geared,0.06552098
at raising money for the hungry and the homeless and in US red used this,0.0680833
idea of Hands Across America a way of fixing the issue of the tethered being,0.09809161
the hungry and the homeless as they have no home since they've been living in,0.17426255
the tunnels and eating nothing but raw rabid while their counterparts live above ground eating,0.46604237
whatever they want chud so there were a few movies that were seen at the,0.06145102
very beginning of the film if you play it close enough attention chug being one,0.06588102
of my favorite horror movies that one jumped out at me you know judge is,0.1537375
a story of these creatures who live underground and homeless people are fed to them,0.25633508
we're laying to the idea that the tethered being homeless and living underground I kind,0.11374456
of think it's obvious as to why that movie is a big reference so what,0.07347686
do the tethered represent to me they represent impoverished disenfranchised or marginalized people you know,0.123035945
us could also be seen as u.s. United States Adelaide even says when they're asked,0.109027416
who they are you know she says we're Americans the tethered represent this idea of,0.09625155
these people who have been here as long as we have but we treat them,0.121421255
like others like outsiders the same way immigrants black folks gays or any marginalized group,0.77560467
is treated which gives the movie a whole new meaning when we consider who we're,0.04847717
supposed to root for in this movie are these people really coming to the surface,0.14067942
just to hurt people with no reason like the media tells us in real life,0.45578903
and in this film or is this justifiable revenge why don't the tethered talk well,0.31089434
disenfranchised people typically don't have a voice until someone from outside of their group is,0.14437543
chosen to speak for them we have to remember red is from above ground she's,0.09219159
technically an outsider to them so the fact that she's the one that speaks for,0.07163546
them I think it says a lot I could totally keep going but I'm gonna,0.0763594
stop there I'm just gonna say again that I loved this movie I like to,0.10250963
get out more because I related to it more but I still thought that US,0.11392947
was an amazing twist on the horror genre the reason being is he has a,0.1500626
voice that is missed in horror for the most part horror has always had socially,0.15523335
conscious films Night of the Living Dead and Candyman are a few but Jordan Peele,0.19226229
is presenting a narrative that solely missed you know the horror movies with with black,0.34661943
people as the center who are not based on stipulations or stereotypes I think that's,0.1492727
really really dope as our horror movies that really make you think about real life,0.23553486
without giving everything to you on an easy platter so I support this fully so,0.24207921
make sure you guys go see this movie then be sure to come back and,0.14339301
let me know what you guys thought of it and let me know if I,0.07027167
missed any of the references or any of the symbolism drop some comments down there,0.060028024
in the comments section but yeah that's it as usual thank you for looking thank,0.04916965
you for loving thank you for being you and I'll see you guys next time,0.18269548
