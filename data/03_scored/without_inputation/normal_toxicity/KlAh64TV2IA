absolutely no spoilers all right so I'm just gonna start off with a big statement,0.13867837
this was probably one of my favorite Marvel movies and it's definitely the funniest honestly,0.13990507
the opening scene in this film completely sets up the movie for exactly what you're,0.06961513
gonna get which is awesome sometimes you go into a movie the opening scene is,0.11039168
fabulous and then the whole rest of the movie you're like wait wait but there's,0.08692727
so much action in this opening scene and there's none throughout the rest of the,0.065436885
movie no the the vibe and the hilarity that you get in the beginning scene,0.1336114
of this movie literally translates throughout the entire film and I absolutely loved that thor,0.06641296
ragnarok is the third installment of the thor series and the millionth installment of marvel,0.058447346
movies but I gotta say sometimes you can get to that third movie and it's,0.08166617
like they've run out of ideas and you're just like ah this isn't as good,0.19758576
as some of the previous ones no this is I don't even I don't know,0.07935836
if it's my favorite Thor movie because I really loved the second Thor movie but,0.052054446
it definitely is up there Chris Hemsworth as usual is the most incredible Thor he's,0.10605395
hilarious in this film as well as strong and heroic which was really nice and,0.08099432
can get a little boring sometimes when you have a lead hero that's just like,0.18050642
I'm a hero all I do is hero a hero there and a hero there,0.026119618
and a hero everywhere but Thor he is a charming and hilarious hero all right,0.08490578
he's got more to him than just saving the world and I love that about,0.06142289
him now we do have some new characters joining us in this film which I'm,0.103984475
not gonna say names in case it's a spoiler but I will say Tessa Thompson,0.07487396
plays a new character in this movie and she's phenomenal absolutely phenomenal I want her,0.14453617
character to have her own movie now there was a moment in the film where,0.053921193
I saw what her own movie might look like and I was like oh my,0.15871555
gosh can we please make this happen SIF never got a movie in fact whatever,0.27264866
happened to SIF who knows she's not in the film which is a bummer because,0.26706108
I love SIF but we do have Tessa Thompson's character and she's awesome she had,0.055632345
some moments in the film that totally stole the show and she was just she,0.24080543
was just such a cool character I loved I loved her character and I thought,0.048145905
that she worked really well alongside Thor and some of the other characters that you,0.068853855
know I don't want to give away too much but I just got to say,0.080446675
I was so pleasantly surprised because I had no idea I was like oh this,0.06515406
character could either be really cool or she could just not be great and I,0.1629675
really liked her and I want more of her character I would love for her,0.09020762
character to have her own movie especially like an origin story of her character I,0.09854566
think that would just be so amazing if you've seen the trailers which I'm sure,0.07601338
you have because they're everywhere we do have Thor going up against Hulk in like,0.110868976
the ultimate gladiator battle in this film and I have to say it is hilarious,0.105545945
but it's not just hilarious it is action-packed and intense at the same time this,0.0670232
whole movie kind of felt like that they did such a good job keeping the,0.09207787
film funny light-hearted but also didn't lack any action or or drama like they did,0.079816595
such a good job at merging both of those things which is what I love,0.043317392
the most about the film we do get a new villain in Thor Ragnarok Kate,0.11443309
Blanchet plays hella who is our villain and she's awesome I thought Cate Blanchett did,0.35511336
a great job so with the comedy and the humor of this film being one,0.10212819
of my favorite parts I can understand that there are probably gonna be some people,0.05672591
out there that think that there isn't enough drama in this movie and maybe think,0.104576394
that the humor or the comedy overshadows the drama of the film and that's a,0.106896006
very fair opinion okay it wasn't dark and gritty and super dramatic but it was,0.11814372
fun and action-packed I still think it had some drama it just wasn't maybe as,0.08051473
drama heavy as say the first Thor movie but that's what I liked about this,0.114239
one I do have to say there is one thing in this movie that I,0.08742111
really really really didn't like and it has nothing to do with the movie it's,0.044410676
just that I don't like Chris Hemsworth gets his hair cut in the film no,0.13695127
he doesn't have his long hair uh I'm so mad I mean we all know,0.27941903
it because it's in the trailer but I was I was not happy I was,0.06690317
like no he has to have his lung beautiful hair okay it's Thor but seriously,0.14832619
the entire cast of this film was just fantastic I mean Tom Hiddleston we have,0.10175732
