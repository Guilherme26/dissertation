feeling that Oscar season it's still going okay so Selma Selma is a movie that,0.06326297
chronicles the events of dr. Martin Luther King jr. how he worked the civil rights,0.08920372
movement you know the nonviolent acts he adopted from Gandhi so he can help give,0.1744645
African Americans rights such as the right to vote I felt like a history teacher,0.32161257
saying that felt badass I don't know why did I have like no coat on,0.38735768
and that's the whole point of the movie so MLK and his followers can get,0.07097877
desegregated from southern law of Selma so they can vote now going into this movie,0.08557557
I thought it was just gonna base it off Martin Luther King Jr's life and,0.10130074
the struggles he had a face although I did show the second part it didn't,0.06824114
really show a whole lot of his life there's usually movies such as Jay Edgar,0.10425383
do that and usually turns into quite a mess he actually sets you up right,0.19491898
from the get-go and it focuses on the much bigger picture with a great amount,0.05081549
of focus Selma was actually a pretty damn good movie the acting in this movie,0.4310618
was just phenomenal David oh yeah I had lo Lloyd Lloyd I can't pronounce his,0.13631853
name his portrayal of Martin Luther King was extremely spot-on for some scenes I thought,0.06566653
I was actually watching Martin Luther King jr. he got so into character I can,0.07180922
imagine when the Oscars come around he's gonna get nominated for Best Actor I mean,0.089180514
it's his movie they showed him in his glorifying moments but what I love most,0.096819736
about his portrayals that they covered parts of his life that not too many people,0.18572423
know about because throughout the whole movie I was like are they gonna cover that,0.06445632
because not only does it affect his character but it also affects the civil rights,0.06840933
movement in itself and they did cover it I'm not gonna tell you what it,0.110129595
is but I was just another way for people to go against him so he,0.17680568
can fail his mission he just showed that this legendary historical figure is vulnerable and,0.08464411
I thought it was a great balance of character I mean even some of the,0.074083775
supporting casts was really great like the woman who plays Coretta Scott King yeah I,0.16611317
don't know where her name is either I feel really bad because they all have,0.15255728
parts of where they stand out as their own character and I thought it was,0.082498014
really cool being translated to scream and a part of that had to do with,0.085847855
the extremely well-written script and the dialogue going on between the characters you know the,0.053423725
movie Lincoln with Daniel day-lewis yeah we all know the dude owned that role those,0.05032544
scenes were he's talking to someone and he's telling stories about his or something like,0.09582536
that as he's speaking you're like yeah cool and you're taking something from his words,0.15313414
same thing with a guy who plays Martin Luther King jr. he's given his speeches,0.15345965
and you're just really inspired by that I'm serious I had a big fat dumb,0.8606264
smile on my face during love scenes and when I got to the scenes of,0.14471446
the civil rights movement holy that was extremely hard to watch this movie is rated,0.15872014
pg-13 so they couldn't fully capture the brutality of the situation so it was just,0.10108754
enough to get to a point where it was horrifying since these activists got the,0.15429895
kicked out of them just sucks what they had to go through so they can,0.8060606
be equal to everybody imagine like that being televised like in this movie they wouldn't,0.067074604
allow it of course bill would still be awful to watch it got emotional for,0.1770612
some scenes and for a movie I gotta give it props now some parts in,0.10253353
the movie like when it comes to the timeline I thought was just done okay,0.08573359
cuz they get to certain moments of the movie where you feel it's important to,0.069166824
MLK's mission and his cause but then all of a sudden it just cuts away,0.11124366
and they don't handle that situation anymore I wish I would know more about that,0.06840956
but I know it's a movie and there's only so much they can cover cuz,0.09504226
I am a huge fan of history and it's always fun to know these little,0.050760996
facts so summer was a great historical movie that was well directed and had a,0.029143093
well-written script David what's his face from rise of the plan of the apes I,0.48690566
hope he gets nominated for Best Actor and some of the supporting cast to some,0.06058524
scenes were executed really good and some not so great I wish they would cover,0.7316613
more on some parts but I'm not gonna hold it entirely because of that so,0.09012512
