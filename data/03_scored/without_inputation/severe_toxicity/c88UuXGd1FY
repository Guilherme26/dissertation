enter our giveaway on Instagram for this stranger things skateboard it's open until December 19th,0.030476054
so enter now I've been a huge fan of del Toro's for years and the,0.019174583
shape of water ranks among his very best and will no doubt lead to tons,0.020635992
of award consideration this season like the seven Golden Globes it's already been nominated for,0.024746163
del Toro describes us as his most personal film as he has always wanted to,0.026639275
make his own version of a classic Universal monster movie in this case he pulled,0.107417844
inspiration from The Creature from the Black Lagoon and the amphibian man's appearance bears more,0.0007411268
than a little resemblance to the original creature unlike the classic Universal monster movies that,0.10073408
inspired him shape of waters is an antithesis to those classic films where the monsters,0.1195774
are treated with some sympathy but ultimately they are rejected by society as monsters and,0.18755385
the only fitting end for them is death the shape of water does the opposite,0.09563944
with its amphibian man treating him not as a monster at all but rather a,0.13901739
romantic hero and in fact worthy of love it's an impressive new spin on those,0.032294665
kinds of films which makes it a real bummer to recently learn that del Toro,0.073247366
turned down the opportunity to helm universals dark universe can you imagine how perfect that,0.050008506
would have been but instead after the lackluster mummy the dark universe is all over,0.21328382
once again before it even got a chance to start but it's probably for the,0.01307485
best that he turned it down as the shape of water is holy his own,0.039434083
creation done on his own terms and is all the more successful because of that,0.02227301
so let's look at the shape of water exploring the main themes of the film,0.022610256
as well as explaining its quite mysterious ending our story takes place in Baltimore in,0.053235978
the 1960s at the height of our Cold War Rasha this time in history is,0.031914182
quite a bit different than today with many people marginalized due to what was believed,0.09961059
by the then current standards of society women handicapped people black people and gay men,0.6146854
are all amongst those that are outcasts by society and essentially treated as lesser than,0.058504898
others unable to reach the same opportunities as others at the time on the opposite,0.0459908
spectrum we have the class with the highest status amongst all others the white man,0.28228018
and all of these sides are represented via characters in the film seeing through their,0.008975323
stories that the ideologies of the time create blind hatred while attempting to understand others,0.10386909
even if considered different by society is the antidote to that mentality our main window,0.0549608
into this is via ELISA a young handicapped woman who is found abandoned as a,0.23178774
child with three cuts on each side of her neck apparently the results of being,0.22202367
attacked which is a pretty horrible thing for a baby to go through because of,0.2483227
this injury she has been mute throughout her life and uses sign language to communicate,0.09425186
with others and this is to literally represent the idea of a woman like her,0.0844424
not having a voice or being heard in the current social climate her being mute,0.088979624
as well as a woman affords her little opportunity and she along with her black,0.246907
friend Zelda work as cleaners for a government research facility ignored and invisible they are,0.045048233
given little praise for their work described merely as piss wipers well that's not very,0.16285957
motivating she are not exactly closeted gay friend Giles live in the shadows of society,0.30795848
in a small set of apartments over a movie theater Giles too suffers from being,0.065214604
outcast by society due to being a gay man we're in the 60s this was,0.23357037
usually kept as a secret and Giles loses his job as an advertisement artist after,0.031971388
an incident most likely involving him being open about being gay just like ELISA Giles,0.16176601
in his own way is mistreated entirely because of who he is and that not,0.03755228
fitting the era's ideologies elisa's life is pretty routine at first until a new asset,0.04659545
is brought to the facility she works at by Colonel Strickland this all-american hero is,0.060450558
at the top of the heap and this eras great America and at the time,0.103743374
things truly were great for people like him he's white married quotes Bible verses missive,0.23907088
Lita Zelda questioning why she has no siblings like most of her people and he's,0.20947231
the kind of guy that when told by a salesman four out of five successful,0.06265564
men drive a Cadillac he buys one on the spot because of course he's one,0.060432598
of those successes himself at least in his own mind the white privilege constantly afforded,0.27221096
to him leads him to believe he is the hero of his own story and,0.023043292
this is kind of a flip of a typical hero of the classic monster movies,0.14238256
the square-jawed hero is supposed to be the romantic adventurer but Strickland personifies this only,0.07928124
to himself and is in fact the film's antagonist he's returned from South America with,0.015929818
a creature a thing as he refers to it an aquatic monster who is worshipped,0.1869931
as a God by the locals and no this is not a spin-off of Hellboy,0.04664933
even though the amphibian man and ape sapien are both betrayed by longtime del Toro,0.08878605
collaborator Doug Jones with the creature now captive Strickland exhibits his feelings of superiority over,0.06283391
it treating it hostile II rather than attempting to understand it prodding it with his,0.07532273
electric baton as the creature is a primal being it reacts aggressively to Strickland's behavior,0.070237406
biting off two of his fingers but if the creature is treated with compassion a,0.17033158
different more sympathetic side emerges which we see in its interactions with ELISA when she,0.10776441
has a chance encounter with the creature unlike Strickland she treats it with wonder and,0.039791286
interest and after more encounters the to develop a friendship even romantic feelings with ELISA,0.045585036
teaching it sign language as the creature also has no voice like herself granting the,0.056307796
two the ability to communicate so we see there is much more to the amphibian,0.070440955
man beyond being a deadly monster but of course to Strickland it is nothing more,0.19310813
than a thing a curiosity and it's decided to kill the creature and perform an,0.30187008
autopsy on him to learn what they can when ELISA learns of this she hatches,0.14510116
a plan with the help of her friends to break the creature out of the,0.13201833
facility keeping him in a bathtub at her apartment in disbelief in losing the asset,0.18380421
and under increasing scrutiny from his superiors Strickland launches an investigation into the escape questioning,0.019438662
all of the employees at the facility when Excel de an√°lisis turned to be interviewed,0.08300827
Strickland dismisses them as possible subjects how could these two possibly pull off a heist,0.1866971
like that and instead pins his suspicions on the Russians being responsible knowing he will,0.087481625
eventually track them down Alisa finds a way to set the amphibian man free once,0.055967886
and for all using a canal that feeds directly into the ocean but they have,0.25935638
to wait until the specific day the rainfall is high enough for it to work,0.033932347
so Giles and ELISA keep the amphibian man in hiding in the mean time and,0.058581393
Giles comes around to accepting the creature after some initial reluctance and we see with,0.04252785
Giles that there is another power at its disposal the ability to heal in this,0.05609294
case after touching Giles is bald head the creature begins to glow blue and veins,0.13773759
all over its body and later Giles finds he has new hair growth on his,0.040217005
once bald head this is our first example of the creatures healing abilities as well,0.068193965
as showing us that concept of understanding once again to the creature even as a,0.03390308
gay man Charles is worthy just like everyone else is worthy of acceptance and he,0.34128684
did help him escape as well as forgiving him for eating one of his cats,0.08687631
so yeah he's a good guy then the fateful day arrives with the rain pouring,0.02968648
heavily as they gather at the canal but before they can set him free a,0.07466819
crazed Strickland arrives furiously shooting the creature and Alisa full of bullet holes the creature,0.6027603
is motionless and for a moment it appears that Strickland got what he wanted in,0.020798963
the end but then the creatures skin starts to glow brightly once again this time,0.047866616
healing his wounds and reviving him and Strickland realizes a little too late the creature,0.057607565
is indeed a god getting his throat slit by its cloth well there you go,0.5004653
buddy that's what you get for being closed-minded and thinking you're right all the time,0.04567417
he constantly undercut everyone unlike him and never believed them to be his equals and,0.05160628
it's his antiquated privileged mentality that got him killed however it looks like Alisa is,0.2745514
gone mortally wounded by the gunshots the creature then scoops her up diving into the,0.17699073
water the two float together and the creature kisses her as he glows causing Elise's,0.029139034
next stars to form into gills filling with breath under the water then after being,0.03401084
healed is now an underwater breathing creature just like the amphibian man the scars that,0.11144819
once made her different have now been turned into life-giving gills what held her back,0.04757992
before is now what can tweets her inner new form now the two can finally,0.048199873
be together having someone that understands them and accepts them for who they are no,0.122195564
matter who they are if a mute woman or a see God as Deltora himself,0.2741232
said do not reduce a person to one word see the other person listen because,0.027144149
the antidote to hatred is understanding again in antithesis to the classic Universal monster films,0.092980035
where their only destiny was to die the shape of water shows us that sometimes,0.10763403
even monsters are worthy of love and acceptance well that'll wrap it up for my,0.1060336
look at the shape of water sorry if I got a little political or anything,0.021558601
they're not trying to make a grand statement about society or anything but merely exploring,0.017447101
the themes behind the film as presented what did you guys think of the shape,0.012452903
