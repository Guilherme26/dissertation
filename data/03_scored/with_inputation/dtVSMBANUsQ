what is up guys we are back talking a brand new movie called the shape,0.11128631
of water this is one of my most anticipated movies for the award season due,0.05147226
to the fact that this movie is directed by del Toro this is one my,0.09679961
favorite visionary directors from pat slam Brent to Hellboy to crimson peak I actually did,0.1542982
enjoy pick a crimson peak I thought it was different and shaved water here is,0.061959002
different and I would like to say that I think this is del Toro is,0.05387242
best film to date I think every single film the guys directed beforehand has led,0.1374745
up to this moment and he's taking every strength and skill from those films and,0.15916844
pushed it into this movie and then any cons are negatives he's had those other,0.11295034
films he's whisked away and put into this brand new fairy tale that del Toro's,0.15287395
dreamed up and it really is just immaculate how creative this film is but also,0.0975632
how beautiful the movie is itself that was a lot of love because this film,0.14103957
every single minute of this film made me fall more in love with it from,0.14993139
the characters written and performed by the actors in here or even from the mythology,0.055682123
brought into here with the fairytale aspect of this fish creature that we see because,0.17458238
I find this film to be a kind of a reference to Creature from the,0.12743796
Black Lagoon mixed it with a different type of fairy tale that's oddly gruesome and,0.05439733
weird at the same time but that's what del Toro does best and I think,0.120858416
that's what this film does amazingly well and the fact that creature from Black Lagoon,0.24197978
is probably my favorite horror monster it this kind of gave me a little bit,0.35202047
more love for this character it's fish creature played by Doug Jones who if you,0.10505162
guys don't know Doug Jones's look him up the guy is a really good actor,0.24253096
and I don't think he gets enough credit where it's due and him playing this,0.0643553
fish creature who really just has no dialogue he you believe in the emotion he,0.21745995
hits in them you believe in the character development that goes with this fish creature,0.26182103
and it's so greatly looked at I mean I have to really praise editorial I,0.07666359
mean that's was really more about prosthetics and makeup and stuff but the process is,0.08694829
to makeup really work on this character and I'm curious to see how much CGI,0.076701246
was actually used for the character because the makeup it looks so realistic like I,0.050720956
would have believed that this thing is something real that they found out that they,0.06467267
found in the real world I loved the look of the character he film really,0.04682812
works because of Sally Hawkins performance in here in Richard Jenkins performance because Sally Hawkins,0.073689185
plays a mute girl in here who really just works this facility this government facility,0.18356526
with Octavia Spencer who offed a via Spencer is also fantastic in here giving a,0.11388474
lot of the great comedic elements to this movie day this film is weirdly oddly,0.12921111
which it is a weird oddly movie but it also has weird oddly humor placed,0.08556763
into it which you would think all does not ruin the theme of the film,0.17296076
and the pacing no it actually enhances it which was weird because like I said,0.08382226
this is del Toro it has those weird kooky vibes to it but it works,0.24122065
for this dramatic undertone for the film because of course this film is overall a,0.08261619
fairy tale it's a weird gruesome fairy tale but it works but going back to,0.24233092
the performances Sally Hawkins I think this might be my second or third favorite performance,0.07143279
maybe it's tied up there with number one I don't know she is so good,0.12722343
in here and there's one scene in pretty with her character that I don't want,0.12830651
to get into but the way this scene was shot the way she performed in,0.18409832
that scene and the way del Toro had the camera whisking around in the scene,0.30600455
was amazing it's something that hasn't been in the trailer it's something that really is,0.053801
an old throwback to older films the scene that is so different from this year,0.0725453
in genre that it really I think for some people could pull them out of,0.10366145
the movie but for me and enhance the role and enhance that moment in the,0.054741986
movie and I really fell in love with that scene I don't want to get,0.1316452
in the spoiler so I'm just gonna say that I think if you've seen the,0.08046619
movie you probably know what I'm talking about it's towards the later half of the,0.11044281
film cores Michael Shannon is also in the film and I mean Michael Shannon's great,0.03759251
when this is they do not a good actor he gives a good performance in,0.1861834
here not one of his best I would say I don't think it's reward worthy,0.14981091
but I think really Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are fantastic in here Richard Jenkins,0.10384088
again one of the actors in here who brings a lot of Lebanese character developments,0.09257027
to him and I love where his character ends up going and I think he's,0.08622208
just a great friend to the character of Sally Hawkins I don't think I've even,0.08041388
talked about how this film was shocked the cinematography for the so I thought Blade,0.0673592
Runner was the most beautiful film of this year but I think this is like,0.05049286
right under that film I think this film is beautifully shot I think del Toro,0.15394887
is way of using the camera and moving it around especially with the underwater scenes,0.09070303
per se or even even the other amazing beautiful imagery you see in this film,0.14203826
this film is just beautiful it's like a portrait and I love saying that because,0.094782434
this is what this film really feels like it feels like paintings and drawings thrown,0.11173978
onto the big screen and I really just every second of this film made me,0.06281728
fall more and more in love with this film from the kooky weird themes of,0.17242017
the film to the great fairy tale aspect as well that totally meshed together well,0.09626894
because it's Del Toro's movie you totally know this is a del Toro movie from,0.12723327
acting from the actors and actresses in here being phenomenal from the creature really working,0.14965627
not feeling cheesy but really you can believe in this relationship between all the characters,0.06802734
in this creature from everything just working in general from that aspect humor really not,0.12934498
giving away the undertone of the drama of the scenes and that humor actually really,0.11514852
enhancing the movie the CGI is a beautiful the film's shot amazingly and I think,0.11155359
I have to talk about the score III think my favorite score from this year,0.051414136
is probably this one it's right up there with Blade Runner but these two are,0.050954077
my pawn my favorite scores from this year and I absolutely adored the score in,0.071752176
this film it really just goes back to the old classic movies they kind of,0.18072486
remind me of a little bit of Fallout as well but I love the score,0.08122115
of this movie and I just fell in love with the score I think the,0.107006356
scores will really make me fall in love with the film and just again the,0.090966485
word is enhanced every aspect of this some enhanced more and more of a reason,0.075348474
to why you should love this film and del Toro overall he's made a near,0.18317471
masterpiece here I think like again I said I think this is my favorite del,0.06981417
Toro film I think it's his best well-made film I will say I have one,0.11115732
con to the film and that con is I felt like the movies pacing at,0.070781045
times was slow it was a little slow at times and to build up and,0.122433975
then sometimes it would ramp it really fast and that was the one thing that,0.051270988
I don't think enhanced her meshed with the film at all but that's really just,0.10013045
a small con in the way of such an amazing film I can't wait to,0.14614876
see the shape of water again I really recommend you guys go check out the,0.09856176
shape of water so with all that said I'm gonna give the shape of water,0.061953824
and a - what we thinking I was gonna give this a perfect score um,0.08805167
I don't I think that con really did bother me especially more on thinking because,0.14089248
when I walk I was like you know on a a plus I loved it,0.10714493
then the more I thought about it I was like you know that pacing really,0.06907623
did kind of bother me at times but really I think Deltora took all the,0.24068466
strengths amped it up to 15 and made an amazing film here guys I think,0.08466547
shape of water is easily gonna be in rewards contender this is easily my top,0.055942144
