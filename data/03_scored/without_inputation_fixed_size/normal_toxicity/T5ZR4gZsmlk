I have always heard about the Marx Brothers I've always seen little parodies of them,0.07886829
in a lot of TV shows I love like Animaniacs and pinky in their brain,0.48683253
they're just a part of American culture and I had very limited exposure to them,0.17340757
and now that I saw a Night at the Opera I'm quite sad that I,0.0668445
didn't grow up with him because they are so fun and there's a knee and,0.105511546
their comedy you find bits of it here and there that are dated bits that,0.2748318
you know I just didn't get jokes that were over my head or referenced things,0.14924952
that aren't part of our culture anymore but by and large I would say 99,0.112676084
percent of their humor is still just as good today as it was back then,0.05353928
and especially they come from the Depression era and you know where we've just come,0.07410163
out of this really really big recession I think a lot of their their jokes,0.15077798
about money and and things like that really really play to us now in a,0.066573195
very similar way to the way it did to them to people back then so,0.0883881
one of the first things that you should know about the Marx Brothers is their,0.06272275
movies are not for everyone this is however one of the first movies that they,0.09475375
did that really had some meat to it before their act was very vaudeville different,0.10227635
little scenarios that they would put together and travel around with this was one of,0.05405816
the first movies they did that actually had a significant plot real story to it,0.056434203
if you've ever seen Looney Tunes Animaniacs tiny to any of those types of shows,0.35074896
you've seen references to this movie probably a lot of them almost every bit of,0.16641748
humor in all of those cartoons comes right out of this movie they do everything,0.10192348
you could even think to do with the Opera House as their playground they go,0.17942148
up the fly system they fly on the backdrops they do all sorts of crazy,0.46575546
stunts on the set one of my favorite moments as they replace the music and,0.09212066
all the musicians stands one of the things that I love about this movie and,0.07531547
about the Marx Brothers in general is they each fill their own niche Groucho has,0.05696452
a really sarcastic sense of humor do you follow me yes well stop following me,0.125203
all have your essence Chico really has all of his own his own little language,0.17868274
his own little accent that he does and he can do puns he can do,0.14840628
just different plays on words and things it's all right that's in every contract that's,0.05481047
what they call a sanity clause hahahahaha you can't fool me there ain't no sanity,0.32715192
clause Harpo does the physical comedy because he never actually speaks everything he does is,0.12512955
over the top physical overly comedic it's amazing something I love about the Marx Brothers,0.06490208
is the speeches that usually Groucho miss although really any time he or Chico give,0.06243908
a speech it is hilarious come on I tell you how we fly to America,0.22472225
the first time I we started we get a half way of course when we,0.041702747
run outta gasoline and we got to go back but joy be unconfined let me,0.15329506
be dancing in the streets drinking in the saloons and necking in the parlor but,0.104866356
one of the other truly significant things about these brothers is that they're all super,0.083222985
talented musically they all do really great things they don't always utilize that in their,0.06901324
movies but they are amazing when you sit them down with their instrument that they're,0.1820265
really good at there's a song that Harpo plays and I'm not a hard player,0.07261193
but I've never seen the harp used the way he used it it was really,0.060763486
really neat there's a little gag number they do on the piano that again it,0.09944723
was just it was musical humor it's in a way i'd never seen it's very,0.06051328
very smart but it's also incredibly impressive they're not phoning it in they're not giving,0.08945903
it half of their effort they are totally bringing intense talent to every minute of,0.10030591
those musical numbers and it's it's fabulous one of my favorite scenes is the contract,0.06368739
scene Groucho and Chico are talking about contracts for their clients and what to include,0.06659306
and what not to include and that's really where you get to see how well,0.06798606
they're different types of humor connect how well they can play off of each other,0.07763627
while Groucho is being very dry and very sarcastic you have Chico who is doing,0.24123009
the play on words and that scene I've never seen anything quite like it where,0.06861432
two people were doing two different styles of comedy and it was working so well,0.12518352
it was connecting so well a big favorite of most everybody who's seen this movie,0.06675437
is the stateroom scene it's called that because he has this little tiny cabin on,0.22321683
a cruise ship and it's a statement and so grouchos in there and both of,0.26934585
the other Marx Brothers and this one other guy in the story they they snuck,0.09841271
in in his giant suitcase so they're in there and he orders dinner so then,0.12948406
you get waiters coming in and you get somebody coming in to check the temperature,0.24151629
and then you get the assistant to come in and check the temperature and you,0.08130262
get somebody coming in to give a manicure and every single person that comes you,0.44785973
keep thinking Groucho is going to say no no we're full but you keep saying,0.10940244
come on in come on in come on in and by the time it's all,0.15735453
said and done there's absolute chaos in the room I think they said there were,0.08498411
more than 15 people in that room all at the same time overall I would,0.1547664
give a Night at the Opera five stars it's really great fun it has a,0.059769627
really nice little story a really happy ending ties up nicely I think overall I,0.17403314
think anybody can enjoy this movie as great as this movie is it's not perfect,0.13698122
it's got its flaws some of the more technical flaws you'll see blips in the,0.07401622
film from time to time just because that's the way movies were made back then,0.05776607
and I guess they didn't have enough coverage so there are several of those that,0.055882473
happen throughout but as far as the content of the film it is just it's,0.050139006
fantastic I would give it between four and five stars I'm gonna say four stars,0.06543348
just because there's a few places right in the middle where it kind of was,0.062404606
a little a little slow and the story kind of disappeared for a few minutes,0.23956928
but because of tomorrow's brothers the fact i had a story it all was amazing,0.048710268
so I give it 4 stars but i really want to give it 5 they,0.040138666
went and they toured this show as a vaudeville act first to see how audiences,0.07451446
would react to it and then they made revisions to the script as they went,0.057775654
to see what what plate and what didn't play and as you hear about scenes,0.06437787
that were cut and scenes that were kept it becomes apparent how effective that was,0.07340706
as a way to sort of preview the show I in fact the state room,0.07513375
scene which is again it's one of the most classic scenes in the movie if,0.07968104
not in all cinema was going to be cut it just wasn't playing wasn't playing,0.17377117
wasn't playing with the audiences and then one night Groucho ad lived the entire scene,0.073984064
his part of the entire scene and the audience just was dying and that ultimately,0.08022362
is the version that ended up in the movie they wrote down what he said,0.07959271
this film is considered a classic even by our government it's in the national film,0.14562806
registry it was actually adopted in in 1993 in case you don't believe me that,0.10251159
this movie is amazing even by today's standards it currently has a ninety-seven percent rating,0.092214115
on rotten tomatoes that's better than probably most anything you've seen in years the two,0.30967513
leads in this movie who are actually the opera singers that the whole film kind,0.07863578
of revolves around are not actually singers but they sing for themselves which was kind,0.082801044
of unique for the day to get two people to sing such intense music who,0.079163924
weren't actual professional singers one story that I heard before I ever saw this movie,0.057625316
that really kind of sold me on the Marx Brothers humor was they made a,0.10197762
movie called a night in casablanca and over a Warner Brothers they heard they were,0.099339016
doing this and they wanted to sue them because Casablanca and so they sent them,0.25914744
this letter the cease-and-desist letter and gruff Joe sent them back a letter and he,0.19671655
said I would just like to congratulate warner brothers on their acquisition of the town,0.08461098
of Casablanca I didn't realize you owned the rights to the whole city consequently we'd,0.09807627
like to counter sue you because we were the Marx Brothers before you were the,0.16415183
Warner Brothers and we'd like to sue you for using part of our name in,0.14902797
your studio and consequently Warner Brothers did not send any reply and the suit was,0.15009971
dropped many of you who enjoy the Marx Brothers sense of humor on the screen,0.25338304
might like to know that they had kind of a similar personality off the screen,0.10946195
when they were called in to their producers office for a meeting and he was,0.08917066
running late they ended up taking off all of their clothes and piling up all,0.17696856
of his office furniture up by his fireplace like as they were burning it to,0.18862809
keep warm he ended up being about three hours late for that meeting but he,0.15391807
