how's it going everybody this is brian for pop culture crossing and today we are,0.02174685
talking about the Philadelphia Story so this movie was released in 1940 and surrounds the,0.033366278
story of Traci Lords wedding now Traci is a rich socialite from a very historic,0.050335113
rich family in Philadelphia the film features memorable characters great dialogue a complex dramatic though,0.0071979524
humorous story and great cinematography all the elements that I think you know result in,0.030150114
a great movie I think you'll enjoy it and you'll probably want to share it,0.03931834
with your friends so the story of this movie is based on Phillip Barry's play,0.020076573
and this portrays the final hours leading up to the to the wedding of Tracy,0.032748323
Lord she's getting married to a man named George Kittredge and he unlike Tracy was,0.039485965
not born into wealth rather he grew into well through his professional progression now the,0.0365851
plans for the wedding however are complicated when Sidney Kidd the publisher of a tabloid,0.09669176
magazine called spy sends reporter and a photojournalist Holly Connor portrayed by Jimmy Stewart and,0.029566083
Elizabeth Embry portrayed by Ruth Hussey to infiltrate the Lord wedding which was being held,0.04148085
on the Lord estate and to provide a juicy story for the magazine so because,0.020532224
the Lord's are pretty strict and do not like the press especially the tabloids you,0.14352202
know it's not easy to get in but the way that they get in is,0.016971495
through Tracy's ex-husband CK Dexter Haven who has also worked for Spy magazine and their,0.03421372
bonus ares bureau and he plans to introduce Macaulay and Elizabeth to the Lord's as,0.04575865
friends of Tracy's brother who works in Argentina and you know knows Dexter as expected,0.029575394
yeah all of the workings and elements here for a very dramatic and humorous story,0.021669688
to unfold so Dexter's unannounced arrival at the Lord residence you know naturally irritates and,0.027025081
distracts Tracy from focusing on the last hours in the last day before her wedding,0.026970536
luckily for the lords Tracy her younger sister Diana and Tracy's mother Margaret are very,0.041794818
sharp and astute and figure out pretty quickly what's going on here and that McCauley,0.179416
and Elizabeth are not actually friends of her brother genius but are actually tabloid reporters,0.038158923
so once the Tracy figures this out she tells Dexter Dexter actually confesses and explains,0.023257481
that he's being exploited by Sydney kid the Spy magazine publisher as part of a,0.114567906
big blackmail operation that if spy doesn't write a juicy story about Tracy's wedding Kidd,0.10344204
will publish a like takedown piece on Tracy's philandering father sets Lord so all this,0.11718075
complexity is developing very early on in the movie the film's pace in general is,0.010694822
very brisk develops really rapidly and this is largely due to the intricacies of the,0.019783892
story and the film itself so because of these factors I definitely recommend if you're,0.010161346
watching this for the first time that you watch it with no distractions because you,0.05278698
know you want to pick up on all the story beats it's very easy to,0.032511517
miss something and if you miss something you know it could you know really alter,0.02150206
your perspective of the film as a whole so you really want to be of,0.028802453
a sharp mindset when you're watching this now that's not to say that this movie,0.037196405
isn't fun because it is a very entertaining maybe to watch you just want to,0.02808605
be able to follow the whole story progression and you know keep track of all,0.01157087
the details at play here as the story develops Tracy learns that Macaulay is a,0.010394825
writer and you know he actually finds his book and really admires the poetry and,0.019969478
the proverbs of his writing and this sparks a flirtatious relationship between the two and,0.023603376
you know this coupled with the fact that Dexter just shows up and it's you,0.037106603
know kind of obvious that he may still like her creates a full-fledged love triangle,0.11877785
so you have Tracy in the middle and then you have George Kittredge CK Dexter,0.15298226
Haven and Macaulay Connor so Tracy's new emotional state kind of when she starts flirting,0.041448258
with Macaulay is really compounded by the fact that her wedding is the next day,0.03433412
so not great timing not you know just not a good situation so that really,0.029535484
compounds and dramatis Isis the story now the Philadelphia Story is narrative though it is,0.064421706
complex is quite engaging as I mentioned briefly and the tone is fairly dramatic as,0.03581216
a whole I would say though there are very fun light comedic elements peppered throughout,0.02493441
so it's not just dry terse drama it is very light and entertaining so throughout,0.02926808
the multi-faceted nature of the story and Tracy's love triangle there are several very important,0.046803653
lessons that are clearly communicated and there's particularly see a sequence of several scenes in,0.01577483
the second act where these important messages are really vocalized so I want to share,0.021830661
these with you just briefly they provide some of this important messaging in the movie,0.049461726
I don't consider them to be spoilers pretty much everything that happens following these conversations,0.044373736
as spoilers and you know I'm not gonna talk about that because you should watch,0.05909425
it but anyways so there three conversations conversation tracy has with Dexter a conversation tracy,0.06774896
has with George Kittredge and a conversation tracy has with her father Seth so the,0.042063553
first stop you know Tracy you know was raised in this wealthy family she's quite,0.04019638
spoiled and frankly acts like a goddess so Dexter notes that because of this she's,0.18981548
always had people get her out of her problems she's never had to fix her,0.09555429
own problems or anything that she has caused she always has her family come rescue,0.07213983
her so because of this Dexter charges Tracy with being a classic narcissist who you,0.27956688
know in addition to be a narc to being a narcissist is very judgmental of,0.18704565
others and other the mistakes of others and she herself has her own struggles but,0.026453689
she maintains this veneer of protection and you know she acts like she's protected from,0.05233266
everyone else and because of this she acts perfect and she thinks she's perfect and,0.075236924
acts like this goddess now more importantly Dexter goes even further and says that Tracy,0.07178728
will never be a first-class woman until she learns to accept human frailty and weakness,0.16011569
now these are you know pretty pretty scathing critiques of Tracy's life here because Tracy,0.11613042
just had this conversation with Dexter I kind of opened her eyes to how others,0.15438381
perceive err and because of this she now views Kittredge a little bit differently and,0.045360867
through kittredges conversation with her it becomes very evident that he does view her as,0.04348638
a goddess and it's like perfect statue that he puts up on a pedestal and,0.076829374
he has no intention of you know bringing down so this all slightly alters and,0.08212623
kind of jars Tracy's perception of Kittredge and you know it becomes very clear that,0.021960372
Kittredge well Tracy actually is very concerned that Kittridge may have actually fallen in love,0.027735498
with her aura instead of Tracy the human now shortly after this talk you know,0.06964473
these conversations are so sequential like boom boom boom and it's like holy cow talk,0.07722982
about overwhelming insane conversation so this final talk between her father Seth and Tracy happens,0.14587212
leading up right into this final party the night before the wedding and Seth just,0.018903853
curtly and bluntly explains that Tracy possesses everything that she needs to be a lovely,0.02975433
woman except an understanding heart and you know Seth's observation as well as Dexter's observation,0.0898131
complement each other and that she's not understanding she's you know doesn't accept human weakness,0.20273466
she kind of and because of that she thinks of herself as you know above,0.079555295
everyone else and these observations from Seth and Dexter are clearly juxtaposed by kittredges just,0.022628218
obsession with her being a goddess and him just like worshiping her however Tracy doesn't,0.10568704
want to be venerated and worshipped she just wants to be loved like a human,0.13039196
like everyone else keep in mind there's this love triangle going on and then everything,0.09886957
else happens and the third act is full and replete with drama and humor so,0.03605628
I'm not gonna spoil how the movie pans out here I'm just gonna set this,0.23720396
up note some of these important lessons here and hope that you watch the movie,0.023784306
and experience it for yourself because I think you're really missing out if you don't,0.041472204
now the performance performance is of the entire cast is just terrific across the board,0.02640247
so in terms of the principles Cary Grant CK Dexter Haven is very well done,0.04984088
he's a very calm and collected character though he's sensitive and he communicates that very,0.035019923
well you get a good sense of Dexter's past and his previous marriage to Tracy,0.02097191
and Grant is great in communicating the emotions felt by dexstar you know very convincingly,0.016772605
Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord is very skillfully acted now Tracy's developmental character art is great,0.047796104
and impressive and notable and this speaks to both the writing as well as Hepburn's,0.018665053
ability to accurately portray this James Stewart and Ruth Hussey hussies portrayal of Macaulay Connor,0.015227384
and Elizabeth imbrie or in breed rather are very well acted as well and a,0.05385726
sharp wit of these two characters especially and just the expert way in which they,0.047707636
deliver them there is a very memorable they have a lot of great one-liners it's,0.050712936
just you know beside observations that some of the audience may be thinking but they,0.0069318786
kind of say it now John Howard's George Kittredge is also very compelling performance Howard,0.034584895
does a great job of showing the Kittredge was not born into the wealth like,0.031781144
Dexter or Tracy rather he grew into it he was a coal miner and then,0.04778546
he rose through the ranks became a manager of a coal company and because of,0.022308929
this he is still kind of on the outside so he there's a lot of,0.03579486
like the upper privileged class that he doesn't really understand and that he's learning that,0.026314665
through Tracy and the Lord's and I think that this element helps make Kittredge a,0.033134792
more realistic character if it weren't for Kittredge Macaulay or Elizabeth you know the movie,0.020747079
would just be full of these super opulent rich people and the majority of the,0.22985286
audiences don't have points of references or touchstones for that so these those three characters,0.032012627
and you know Dinah's character the younger sister especially make it more you know more,0.02421069
realistic and connects more with the audience themselves lastly virginia wheelers Dinah Lord is you,0.04180546
know Tracy's younger sister is the most enjoyable character in the movie I think just,0.037547622
dinah likes dexter she doesn't like Kittredge and she's not you know happy about this,0.10942204
whole marriage thing at all and though she is young she's very perceptive very self-aware,0.07061989
and she actually connects a lot of the dots of you know what's happening between,0.040222324
the characters before the adult characters themselves are able to see and realize what's going,0.012323192
on and you know this keen awareness coupled with her dramatic antics just adds to,0.12759686
the characters charm and you know this type of the character actually really reminds me,0.013210547
of Maura Wilson's Susan Walker in Miracle on 34th Street and that they are very,0.016971495
young but they're wise well beyond their years and you know their observations and opinions,0.016384138
go toe to toe with the adult characters and wheeler does a great depiction of,0.06150953
this and a spot-on in her performance so the Philadelphia story's production design and cinematography,0.017254198
are all so well done and you know they are worth noting frankly the set,0.022186534
pieces particularly the pieces around the lordís state and residents are very well done and,0.044399012
well realized and these set pieces complemented with the cinematography and the tight tight nature,0.12573966
of the shots and just how the shots themselves are composed really make it immersive,0.13196911
and make the audience feel like you are actually a fly on the wall on,0.038410366
you know in the Lord residence watching this entire thing unfold it's actually really impressive,0.03433412
how it's the production design and the cinematography are executed now George Cukor's direction of,0.05620802
the Philadelphia Story is frankly nothing but masterful he is able to seamlessly translate this,0.027594479
complex story and originally play into cohesive type film and the final product is just,0.0066378675
clear evidence of Cougars ability to expertly manage the production the cinematography the music and,0.031333476
expert ability to bring about very very great convincing performances from his entire cast and,0.046914738
as such tell a quite touching story so I've seen the Philadelphia Story numerous times,0.023917343
and each time I see it it seems like I pick up on something new,0.06438047
and this is a testament of robust storytelling and directing now this movie I highly,0.021462815
recommend it I think it's a great go to movie if you're looking you know,0.055209577
