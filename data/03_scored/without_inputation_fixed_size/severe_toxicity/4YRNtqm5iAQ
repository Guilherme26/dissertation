the cabinet of dr. Caligari this is a 1920 film from Robert wine an absolute,0.02051759
classic kind of a horror fan rite of passage because many many do credit this,0.035928566
as being really the first film to be categorized as horror as something meant to,0.05725701
to scare audiences and you know chill them to their core things like that and,0.054210473
it is a silent film 1920 a German film a German expressionist film so with,0.028329507
that you get a lot of the exaggerated set pieces and real kind of surreal,0.06715894
nightmarish kind of look to it where it's it's not meant to kind of reflect,0.046149112
reality but kind of I don't know reflect the mental state of the characters within,0.063976035
this nightmarish kind of world so that works really well and you obviously I mean,0.055163015
you can kind of look a little closer and see that there may be like,0.021178117
cardboard cutouts said sort of paper things like that but 1921 when the camera like,0.038639855
was stagnant you know not moving around it you can kind of get away with,0.04037598
that kind of visual trickery which I mean this film has to be the absolute,0.056442827
best example of something like that of the German expressionist kind of kind of thing,0.17147769
well I had seen the movie a few times before this month actually I had,0.044049792
the opportunity to catch it on the big screen see it a theater with with,0.020163711
a live score played for the filament and that was really cool and and really,0.016753316
cool like it was almost a full house so it was very nice to see,0.042058896
that it looks like the the lure of the good doctor still still can bring,0.022247067
in audiences to this day and and still hopefully scare people so that is that,0.046441793
was great basic part of the movie it is we have this sort of like,0.035293315
the main character Francis he's he's recalling the story of meeting this doctor and how,0.012609221
basically the doctor Caligari he he travels from town to when they have fairs and,0.021309823
in this this particular town is having their fair their festival whatever you want to,0.015637137
call it and his attraction is some nebulous sleepwalker I guess named Caesar the the,0.16683471
tall spooky looking fella that's that's the most memorable kind of visual of this movie,0.089603566
I guess you could argue and this scare probably the scariest thing about it the,0.032945216
attraction is he's forever asleep I think he's been asleep for 23 years but when,0.037186425
he awakens him for the audience he has the ability to see the past see,0.033200648
the future read fortunes things like that and it certainly affects some of some people,0.047339123
and and basically what starts happening is within this small town there are murders happening,0.074552454
and we begin to suspect and of course the main character and the the police,0.22347441
force they begin to suspect that it might have something to do with this dr.,0.038277328
Caligari and his sleepwalker and it's about piecing that all together there's a general plot,0.06282526
of the movie it's I mean of course you know it's it's a very influential,0.035376463
film where I mean like some obvious examples like David Bowie and and his Ziggy,0.03950526
Stardust persona was very much inspired by the Caesar character even if you like watch,0.04025891
Rob Zombie's video the living dead girl basically it's like almost like you know shot-for-shot,0.52288073
cabinet of dr. Caligari stuff like that and like a lot of modern movies really,0.03201662
take examples from this and storytelling techniques from this movie to this day this 100,0.03363102
year old movie so I mean I like I'll probably be getting into spoilers here,0.09640573
so if you don't want this century-old movie spoiled for you I mean short reviews,0.14294264
this check it out definitely check it out and if by any chance you do,0.02530159
have an opportunity to catch a screening with a live score see it with an,0.04670454
audience absolutely take advantage of that it was a great experience but I mean what,0.033621706
it it has inspired a lot like within horror genre and thriller and things like,0.03487957
that is the display of the mental state of madness and how a story establishes,0.24183172
that because really this this is kind of I mean first silent film from 1920,0.035484888
it's really ambitious plot wise and very layered plot wise and quite complex where we,0.03288934
do have kind of like a a story within a story than a big twist,0.02306857
and where with the the category character everyone's trying to figure it out Francis's best,0.014543575
friend is killed by Caesar and he's trying to figure it out with the police,0.42372626
they they track it down to the mental institution where the director of this institution,0.2002582
is the spitting image of this Caligari and we learned through his diary that he,0.072397254
had become obsessed with supposedly the real Caligari and he wanted so badly to learn,0.06050311
the ways of some Nambu lism and using a sleepwalker to perform your will having,0.12809308
control over them being their master and doing things that they normally wouldn't do that,0.04072387
they would find a testable such as murderers as we see with with Caesar and,0.45643523
so he kind of steals his identity in a way but we wonder how can,0.13082433
this really be so I mean the the big twist of the movie is that,0.027086943
the the character Francis the the man he's speaking to is is actually just another,0.009983742
patient within the institution and this whole thing has kind of been within his mind,0.023875436
but is it really or is it actually the the insidious work of dr. Caligari,0.035335887
because there is kind of there there's this final shot in that film before they,0.08336148
they iris out where you know everyone within the story of the film appears in,0.02044974
the end as patients where you think okay he's just used those as examples within,0.034380015
his mind you play out this deranged fantasy of his and they take him away,0.25246507
at the end and Caligari he's like ah yes okay i understanded lusion now I,0.047680363
can help him but then he kind of like gives this little look - like,0.037408598
suggest that maybe this is this has all been his doing is kind of like,0.02075506
a supernatural twist to it so there is kind of a blend of the supernatural,0.060624838
and a blend of just the psychotic of this main character so we kind of,0.13099329
we're left to wonder how much of each it is affecting the overall story so,0.019110061
that's pretty clear and like eaec like with any movie where it kind of like,0.026099145
you know turns out in a twist that the person was was crazy all times,0.12831458
it was a delusion the whole time I mean it's it's been done time and,0.042545147
time again and this movie had really kind of set the groundwork for that where,0.02862884
you know in with these sets and kind of having the the surreal visual style,0.032603975
to what we see the environment within where these characters are are living you know,0.009056475
the the skewed doors and the flooring that's like kind of all centering into this,0.0344472
character in a very specific kind of way is it's all really cool and and,0.018149536
even kind of stuff like where we see when reading the diary the madness of,0.022856375
the institutions director where he's seeing like he's gone totally insane he's seeing in in,0.13619834
the sky on the trees on the doors become Caligari over and over again and,0.022698727
kind of establishing that mental breakdown and like visual cues like that so like all,0.0979004
that kind of stuff I mean you can kind of trace back to this movie,0.06396805
so it is highly influential but I mean at the same time it does work,0.028267644
really well you know on its own it I think it still holds up well,0.028796466
as a scary movie like even like you know it is kind of scary or,0.05046948
spookier to see a movie like this where it is I don't know just because,0.05441934
it is so old because it is silent because the image we see feels just,0.017975258
a little ghost leer I guess I don't know quite what it is but there,0.024791395
is something really really creepy about silent films and and especially this one that you,0.057328854
know it it does tell its story so effectively visually right not just you know,0.023486305
within some of the over-the-top stuff but you know obviously the the title cards which,0.02044176
even like in the original German they're they're very kind of over the top and,0.09653677
and twisted themselves meanwhile like if you're an english-speaking audience member you just kind of,0.2610807
see the little subtitle bottom which which isn't too much but still still very effective,0.08557588
in telling the story and a spooky scary story indeed it is and the this,0.033086233
version that I saw like I think some versions have like just plain black and,0.13980962
white I guess but this one I saw it had kind of like the tints,0.12609753
to it to you know set certain look at them you know like that a,0.023300719
light yellow tint or a light red tint and things like that and this version,0.03685317
must have been some guy list a semi recent restoration because the movie looks great,0.034763828
it almost looks like a modern movie trying to look like an older movie like,0.056719545
this which is pretty cool and of course I you know I really enjoyed the,0.030466741
the live musical accompaniment which is really good it was the band is called the,0.019213164
invincible Tsar's who they're an Austin band and they traveled the US and Canada and,0.013890365
they made their way up to my neck of the woods and I was able,0.12200998
to see that so I mean I can't recommend strongly enough that if if they,0.03246096
do happen to be playing in your town one of these one of these presentations,0.028296247
absolutely take a look much like Calgary himself kind of touring around and in bringing,0.12568246
horror to the unsuspecting audiences and things like this a very influential film of course,0.058938596
very hat film and kind of being the first in the horror genre and establishing,0.053241964
all these kinds of psychosis and and supernatural and very visually scary just certain images,0.12853277
from the film just standalone are just so eerie looking and it's so well done,0.02335726
absolute classic I love the movie a rite of passage I'd say for any kind,0.07299127
of horror fame you want to kind of see where it all kind of started,0.07087
kind of the the first horror movie if you won't call it that and that's,0.053527992
that's at the cabinet of dr. Caligari so if you can't check out one of,0.013706774
the the performances I'm sure you can find it pretty much and I don't think,0.046137802
it's I think it might be in the public domain but you can probably easily,0.013779279
find it pretty much anywhere pretty pretty accessible I would say so if you haven't,0.0626889
seen it before if you don't mind the spoilers that I gave you definitely check,0.014980601
it out well worth it well worth bringing to the table to your Halloween who,0.0791083
are viewing if you're doing a a marathon like I am this month 31 days,0.064382456
of horror plenty more reviews to come stay tuned for those until next time stay,0.028221082
