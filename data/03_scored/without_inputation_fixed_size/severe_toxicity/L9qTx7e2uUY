named Strickland investigates this disappearance until eventually discovering Eliza intends to release the amphibian man,0.038728986
into the sea over the course of the film we see various ways in which,0.016270392
social systems oppressed minorities or people with less political power ableism in the form of,0.11648696
how Eliza is treated due to her disability racism of course sexism well it's the,0.34618312

guillermo del toro is touching on here is a sociological concept of the other the,0.076073065
idea of other nests essential to sociological analysis of how majority and minority identities are,0.023493621
constructed this is because the representation of different groups within any given society is controlled,0.048128698
by groups that have more political power than the other in the setting of the,0.026336616
film for example white people constructed the social identities of racial minorities by representing them,0.19800521
through stereotypes and superficial observations when Strickland meets Zelda the cleaning woman mentions that she,0.04958944
is an only child Strickland incented remarks that this is unusual for her people a,0.05359584
minute or so later Strickland mentions the appearance of God and says that he probably,0.029588034
looks more like Strickland than like Zelda so in everything from social matters to religion,0.07638636
Strickland is constructing the representation of another people later in the film the diner employee,0.02964657
tells the african-american couple that they are not allowed to sit down at the counter,0.58081174
uttering other people has obvious discriminatory aspects that permeate throughout social interaction and even the,0.023419786
law but there is also a psychological component to it social identities reflect the way,0.022781875
individuals and groups internalize their established social categories within their societies such as their cultural,0.046053324
identities class identities gender identities sexual identities and so forth these social categories shape our,0.14885147
ideas about who we think we are how we want to be seen by others,0.016113408
and the groups with which we belong one of the major contributing factors to ending,0.07177065
racial segregation in America was proving that this had a severe negative psychological effect on,0.2535766
children social identities are created through ongoing social interaction with other people and the resulting,0.14948939
self-reflection about who we think we are according to these interactions this is something called,0.0552741
the looking glass self social identities are produced through agreement and disagreement with other people,0.06715694
and we adjust our behavior and self-reflection based on these interactions when Strickland invades Zelda's,0.080805846
home to discover the location of the amphibian man her husband Brewster briefly objects before,0.060514417
almost immediately backing down and allowing Strickland to manhandle his wife he also gives up,0.13708171
the location of Eliza and the amphibian man this interaction is terrifying to watch and,0.038956482
as an audience we might wonder why Brewster does not defend his wife however bear,0.038623225
in mind that his previous interactions with white men and the discrimination he faces might,0.23645562
have persuaded him that this is not a fight that he could win that even,0.048925586
if he throws him out of his home he and Zelda might face consequences for,0.090192914
that his social identity is the result of his disagreements with other people and his,0.03983785
unwillingness to get involved as a result of his self reflection of who he is,0.055654585
and what he can and cannot do after the incident Zelda tells Brewster that he,0.028372744
could never understand what it is like to be her the implication that Brewster is,0.022849059
not willing to understand what it is like to be a woman socialization shapes our,0.094753414
ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman and the unequal,0.06948708
relationship between these two identities Strickland sexually harasses Eliza at work we could say that,0.13625954
he does this because he is a bad person and maybe he is but he,0.19019397
is permitted to do this because many societies establish certain privileges in men if Eliza,0.076286584
complained there is a strong chance that the accusation would be dismissed as quickly as,0.018295212
she would be dismissed from her job 20th century philosopher Simone de Beauvoir once said,0.086978085
thus Humanity is male and man defines woman not at herself but as relation to,0.13798037
him she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference,0.02265017
to her he is the subject he is the absolute she is the other Strickland,0.046077937
says that Eliza's inability to speak sexually arouses him and when he has sex with,0.44542217
his wife he places his hand over her mouth so that she cannot speak he,0.30107942
enjoys the ability to shape the social identity of others his references to the biblical,0.12563789

shape of water takes place during the Cold War in the 1950s the American government,0.049414497
and the Soviet government do not have any specific use for the amphibian man outside,0.077804536
of a brief discussion about the likelihood of his biology helping the space race the,0.042060226
American general explicitly says that if the Soviets wanted that America wants it if the,0.025850367
Soviets wanted they can't have it because the so it's must be up to no,0.06968996
good his sole basis for reasoning is that they are Soviets the shape of water,0.058459666
shows not only a tolerance for the other but also a love unlike in say,0.03933497
Beauty and the Beast the amphibian man does not need to transform into a human,0.25353575
to receive a happy ending movies generally present us with clear heroes and villains in,0.037403278
the film Strickland is the villain he is the true monster of the shape of,0.1896718
water movies and perhaps stories in general reinforce an individualistic worldview the idea that society,0.02412355
is made up of individuals making independent choices and that your lot in life is,0.0322654
primarily a result of your own actions irrelevant to the actions of others the individualistic,0.03235187
model of the world posits that people do what they are and that injustice and,0.13775155
impression are the result of the isolated actions of a fringe group of bad people,0.12824342
like Strickland but the truth is that the social systems that individuals create become more,0.017683906
powerful than the individual as individual people we are always participating in these social systems,0.01889321
a family is a social system a workplace is a social system when we meet,0.014069299
people and either introduce ourselves or shake hands we are participating in a social system,0.019641543
when we interact with our employers we are participating in a social system and when,0.0069877543
we treat people a certain way based on their social identity we are also participating,0.033707514
in a social system it is so inescapable that it has become ubiquitous and therefore,0.03765405
invisible we choose not to see it and choose only to see the individual in,0.032960515
a sense the villain of the shape of water is not Strickland rather it is,0.016708083
the institutions and systems that affect the characters the villain is racism sexism homophobia etc,0.14127569
Strickland exhibits most of these traits so he is more like the representative of these,0.051882993
systems and functions as the voice of the institution of uttering people because a film,0.068774
is told through and visuals rather than invisible systems of oppression to the credit of,0.016705422
the shape of water Strickland's motivations are related to his being in a system in,0.01796262
this case the government's military and intelligence sectors he complains to the general in individualistic,0.06704187
terms Strickland says that he has proven himself time and time again however the system,0.021635763
does not care about that because it is bigger than the individual Strickland is portrayed,0.053224668
as the villain of course and the audience is meant to root against him but,0.025274318
when many are confronted with the facts about other investments some are quick to dismiss,0.0121023515
the concept become defensive miss the point and talk about personal responsibility instead or choose,0.01070081
the path of least resistance ignoring it as someone else's problem that is how social,0.025179196
systems and individuals interact individuals are not completely powerless though they can choose to walk,0.07236666
away from the path of least resistance and actively fight a systemic oppression despite the,0.03986512
pressure from the social systems to conform the shape of water shows us an example,0.012048472
of this when Eliza turns on the television she and Joe see the 1950s civil,0.041401695
rights movement and suppression of these protests by the police Giles frustrated demands that Eliza,0.1258308
turn it off he can't stomach watching it and instead prefers watching Bojangles an african-american,0.35709876
performer not a protester Giles who is a gay man living in the 1950s must,0.2633944
be careful about his interactions with other people his flirtation with the diner employee ends,0.19144984
badly but it could have gone much worse for him if the employee had decided,0.05730291
to become violent however his sexuality is something that he can hide and therefore has,0.3153155
a small luxury of not engaging Zelda in contrast must take into account who she,0.06588378
is speaking to in every situation in her life to protect herself from sexism and,0.14741068
more violent forms of bigotry related to her race Giles tries to make this someone,0.24704699
else's problem and exemplified by Eliza's request to help the amphibian man which he also,0.031301547
rejects he eventually finds that he cannot take it anymore seeing the diner employee reject,0.03880016
him and then shoo away African Americans he realizes that hiding in the system men,0.23216136
ignoring the problem is no way to live and he helps Eliza rescue the amphibian,0.07146334
man he even fights Strickland it's easy to pretend sociological systems of oppression do not,0.04016246
exist sometimes they benefit us and we instinctively side with things that benefit us also,0.03607557
because we would prefer to think of ourselves as individuals instead of existing within complex,0.09147739
social systems that we do not entirely control and also because such systems are invisible,0.012686382
