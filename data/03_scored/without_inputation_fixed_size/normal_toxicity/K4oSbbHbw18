hey what's up everybody today we're talking about the comedic drama called the favorite directed,0.09201407
by your ghost land the most the cast is headlined by Emma Stone Rachel Weis,0.14927748
and Olivia Colman I'm gonna let you know where this film thrived I'm gonna let,0.17994075
you know where it fell short and I'm gonna give you my opinion on if,0.10696129
I think it was a successful film so let's get into it historia said in,0.08379063
eighteenth-century England it focuses on Queen and played by Colman she's in weak health she,0.11104616
has an unpredictable temper as well and in her place Lady Sarah played by Rachel,0.10659035
Weisz governs the country while also tending to the Queen's well-being and this is a,0.08003164
dynamic that's complicated when a new servant named Abigail played by Emma Stone enters the,0.07039156
picture and begins to meticulously insert herself into the relationship which naturally causes a lot,0.20222741
of issues the style of director your ghost lanta MOS is definitely an acquired taste,0.2962509
I don't think his films are aimed towards general audiences either but regardless of that,0.110097155
I think he routinely crafts some highly artistic films that always captivate me to the,0.28709313
point where I'm not often sure whether I liked or disliked what I had just,0.10974406
seen which is something very odd for a person like myself who virtually has an,0.09433324
opinion about everything in terms of his overall body of work I would say this,0.15174699
is easily as most consumable film it's his most straightforward project but I definitely think,0.1241972
it still had some of the hidden elements in the narrative that provoked a lot,0.05156146
of thought which I always do appreciate from him it also had some beautifully polished,0.119784445
visuals that I really love from his direction and his artistic eye I think he,0.115622535
did a great job of giving the camerawork a personality of its own in this,0.11222308
story that just complimented the tone perfectly most often he has the camera lower shooting,0.18582071
up at the characters to give them a stronger on-screen presence this framing of the,0.06457312
shots is also really able to capture all the ornate detail of the backdrops at,0.09404534
all times he also positions the camera to frame the walls on longer angles which,0.059482634
just provided a ton of depth throughout the film and it routinely pulled me into,0.049922504
the scenes in the rooms with the characters he also made interesting use of a,0.05832383
fisheye perspective to create kind of a stuffy feeling that fit the atmosphere of the,0.09419911
story very well he complements that with simple camera pivots to follow the characters and,0.06628689
it really helped me feel and connect with the mood of each scene which I,0.08190456
found subtle but highly engaging I thought the makeup and the wardrobe design were flawless,0.06298455
the cinematography from Robbie Ryan just complimented the direction perfectly about the lighting did a,0.075881384
great job of fitting the tone of each scene perfectly to just heighten the emotional,0.06234965
reaction I thought the score was this subtle but impending and it did the same,0.056656968
in terms of just bolstering the film when needed I very much enjoyed the progression,0.050603703
of the storyline it develops the relationships between all the focal characters with a nice,0.049051613
flow it touches just enough on the state of the country and the governing issues,0.1314426
that are going on behind the batch up of all these relationships nicely it gives,0.1118114
a lot of weight and meaning to certain scenes and for me I was able,0.10935864
to find the story to be more than compelling enough to hold my attention I,0.060505398
thought it had enough explanation to it but it also had many implied meanings and,0.053757485
I thought this balance of both is why this could easily be the most mass,0.05648421
consumable film from land the most who I think is a fantastic director from a,0.09355856
technical aspect but as good as the story was it's the lead trio of performances,0.0792089
that make this movie worth a watch wise stone and Coleman are all at the,0.09489246
top of their game in this movie the performances are filled with layers of emotion,0.09175595
and intensity and I was really able to invest in each of them for their,0.096158646
own reasons the chemistry between one another was fantastic as was their timing and the,0.045886084
result was a collection of character dynamics that hit with a lot of impact because,0.06257914
they felt genuine in their build up Rachel Wise was excellent she thrives in time,0.0681323
period pieces and she did in this one as well she was just unassuming one,0.18484613
minute and so matter-of-fact and blunt and callous the next she showed strength and vulnerability,0.1318914
with a nice balance and when it was called bond she hit some very emotionally,0.16120647
charged scenes with a very smooth capable delivery and as the story progresses and control,0.07652064
begins to be threatened by her character she's really forced into some emotional positions and,0.29633325
Weiss portrays it all with a fascinating literalness that I just found very appealing and,0.054330856
I thought Olivia Coleman was much the same as the story evolves we learned more,0.085926935
about her capability in the position of being the Queen as well as her mental,0.5902091
state her health and her mental strength are just slowly deteriorating and Coleman really captures,0.40331045
this range of distress impeccably I thought this vulnerability is what allows a manipulative person,0.31089434
into her bedroom and into her heart so to speak and I thought the way,0.40310633
Coleman captured this conflict was just impressively genuine and as you would expect emma stone,0.09749069
did not disappoint either she was easily the most interesting character there were so many,0.072526984
different sides to this role throughout the course of the story and I thought stone,0.053299204
really nailed all of them with perfection through her facial expressions her mannerisms and the,0.42619586
delivery of the dialogue I thought she perfectly captured her characters just methodical manipulation just,0.09752431
as the story needed it to she was charming and calculating at all times and,0.060889397
with stones performance I was just completely intrigued by what her next move would be,0.07340659
and I found the unpredictability to be very refreshing nicholas hoult comes in and provides,0.06764581
a great supporting performance as well and overall I think everybody did a great job,0.060971484
in their roles I thought the dialogue was just nicely written it was sharp witted,0.36785927
the humor was very clever I routinely was laughing and chuckling from the back and,0.166581
forth between the characters some of the laughs because of the genuineness of the material,0.09977401
and the Frank delivery from the performers other laughs coming from just the timing of,0.07040446
the situation's of a given scene and like you would expect from the lanthum of,0.107151225
film some laughs just out of simple awkwardness from the sexual imagery this is where,0.5362537
I think general audiences could sort of disconnect from this movie a bit some of,0.08093483
the dialogue felt more worded for shock value than it did genuine lanthum oohs also,0.06464005
likes to slip implied masturbation and forced nudity into his films and that's his choice,0.8588031
the humor though is routinely timed with the effective satire some of the sexual implications,0.4744775
in this story are without question needed for it but some are simply not I,0.051099855
don't think a panning shot of a character walking past a row of women lined,0.34452057
up along the wall all with their breasts hanging out has much of an impact,0.7714798
on the story and no matter how artistic you try to make it the result,0.085826226
is gratuitous and not much different than this no I'm not judging much like when,0.0706556
I was younger some kid down the road is gonna be watching HBO one night,0.24096581
he's gonna see this movie and it's gonna be his first movie he ever sees,0.21641995
but these are scenes that are gonna rub a large portion of audiences the wrong,0.2225323
way who may not be familiar with lanthum OSes body of work but overall I,0.11504897
found it to be a very good film that had me engaged from start to,0.08306723
finish and the favorite from me is gonna get 85% on the entertainment meter both,0.06440299
the characters and the plotline continually evolves with an intriguing flow that kept onto my,0.05886118
interest it's a beautifully crafted film but some people may be turned off by the,0.079433605
forced sexual subject matter that doesn't seem to be moving the story forward and some,0.4799699
of the dialogue that those who tend to love traditional time period movies may be,0.06988496
very surprised by if they go into this movie without doing their research first thank,0.07194039
