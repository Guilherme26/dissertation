seeing wonder woman leap into action and those moments are very carefully placed throughout a,0.05057258
very thoughtful and engaging story make no mistake above all wonder woman is a great,0.06283923
story but still when she leaps into action it is something that I will never,0.02921021
forget having witnessed and then I never ever will get tired of seeing you know,0.052111153
everything that's ever been said about Wonder Woman how she represents women and what they,0.081635326
can and should be I got to admit in the past sometimes I rolled my,0.09983874
eyes when that's been discussed but here I finally get it she finally I think,0.047841337
has become what she was always intended to be and I have gone from thinking,0.06386694
that Wonder Woman is okay she has her moments to her actually challenging Batman I,0.041222762
can't believe I'm saying this as my favorite superhero I'm not just talking about raw,0.03354388
power although it's an impressive display year but also her ideology that we get to,0.043884825
see take shape before us and I think that in seeing that ideology take shape,0.0497564
we can better understand it and not roll our eyes at it that makes a,0.022473894
lot more sense now when I got out of the press screening we were allowed,0.016531143
to tweet about the movie the social and gargle had been lifted and I said,0.059514645
it's one of the best movies not just DC EU or Cod book movies that,0.049533565
I've ever seen and one of you tweeted me back J's Lewis and Meryl and,0.06496915
you were like Citizen Kane vertigo Seven Samurai Wonder Woman and I say no not,0.07318883
Citizen Kane I would say more The Little Mermaid Indiana Jones and inglorious basterds I,0.3496025
had to choose that last one very carefully and I set a lot of glorious,0.043322746
bastards for several reasons one humor this is a very funny movie uh to that,0.6805241
it rewrites history you know inglorious basterds played with history and of course this movie,0.2371839
plays without the history of World War one but always very respectfully and also a,0.028910212
love of old movies there's a real Turner Classic Movies feel to this Wonder Woman,0.050893866
that just permeates the entire film there are scenes that would feel right at home,0.022468572
you know both romantic scenes and scenes about war on Turner Classic Movies it's and,0.10057976
if you're a fan of Turner Classic Movies oh you're just going to be an,0.032738343
absolute odd they've been able to fold that into a comic book movie we talked,0.0335951
about playing with genres right like oh this is a spy comic book movie this,0.06007074
is a horror comic book movie this is a Western comic book movie this is,0.1442045
an old-fashioned comic book movie and you're Batman V Superman I imply applauded for its,0.08143976
ambition but this again it's not only very old-fashioned filmmaking but it has a distinct,0.034881566
female point of view now in the past that has meant a grading viewpoint men,0.10957105
vs. women a lot of negative connotations and interestingly for the most part up until,0.12277693
now or this year feminism and popular entertainment has actually been crafted by men including,0.074546464
Wonder Woman herself throughout the decades mostly male creators but here patty Jenkins and gal,0.036217254
gadot and also Emma Watson asked I have to give a shout out and how,0.088768095
she shaped Belle because I think this is all part of the same movement are,0.17550072
able to finally put feminism a brand of feminism in popular culture that is productive,0.059836596
and admirable instead of destructive and grading and now so exciting I think this is,0.08511557
the feminism that so many of us have been fighting for and whenever we see,0.14796612
these some of you recently have said grace you seem very upset with female characters,0.10441188
lately and it's because I'm like that is not where I want representing feminism it,0.21378337
makes me look bad and makes all women look bad this this and Belle please,0.25767404
look to this this is what I want to define feminism and back to that,0.098311484
journey that this movie has you take I think that's really important because instead of,0.029488256
just showing you the destination by having you take the journey of feministic thought I,0.2590355
think it because are accessible to some people who maybe previously have rolled their eyes,0.039640956
effect I think that every woman who watches Wonder Woman would hope that she shares,0.106644906
many of the same qualities and I also think that they would look at her,0.0598499
relationship with Steve Trevor as an ideal relationship of partners it's so amazing and I,0.014105884
want to take a just a slight moment a moment here before we get into,0.048954856
Steve Trevor I have so much to say about Steve Trevor I really want to,0.018916493
point out that well patty Jenkins is the driving creative force here it is very,0.03185764
important to note that the screenplay and the story are entirely written by men and,0.029187594
it is very much the message of this movie that it's best when men and,0.08804238
women work together and it both have something to offer and that both are corruptible,0.19010083
very important there's been a lot of talk about you know gender separation and that's,0.062376264
that's the pepper feminism we're trying to move away from okay now make no mistake,0.12933499
this is very much Steve Trevor's movie just as much as it is Wonder Woman's,0.023948606
and as much as this movie maybe a fan of Wonder Woman it made me,0.08297501
that much a fan of Steve Trevor he is her Lois Lane well what Lois,0.011303466
Lane used to be quite tragically in fact Lois Lane has been sidelined these days,0.052246183
nowhere near the reporter she once was but she said but Steve Trevor he's never,0.033391554
been so much of a spy before a man of action he was just so,0.04651696
great and he's every bit as appealing and vibrant as Lois Lane is in her,0.057239052
best stories but unlike Lois sometimes Steve leads and sometimes Wonder Woman leads they have,0.018591218
a pretty good dance going on and once you see the movie you'll understand that,0.041179523
reference and also so importantly Steve Trevor is instrumental in shaping Wonder Woman's ideology he,0.006099069
is an incredibly important figure in her life beyond their romance now speaking of Lois,0.06510817
and romance you might recall that in the original Superman movie which is hugely influential,0.020912709
on patty Jenkins as you can tell when you see this film there was a,0.031111304
pretty risque line about what color Lois's panties are you know x-ray vision and all,0.13148485
that and this movie is just as playful what's so much more risque I was,0.05162357
shocked at some of the things they put they put in here let's just say,0.051116038
that Wonder Woman is very curious and Steve Trevor is more than happy to explain,0.017473044
I I was just it was just crazy but I have to tell you it,0.08241293
was so much fun and it was so incredibly romantic I'm like like Titanic level,0.04666995
romance I was amazed at how romantic this film is this is a fantastic date,0.028727286
movie but because of some of the risque lines I would advise anyone thinking of,0.03216695
taking young children that they might want to see this movie first just to make,0.14631446
sure they're okay with some of the things that are referenced in here you might,0.029923951
be like really in a comic book movie in a DC in you movie they,0.09357604
would really do that yes let's just say there's Princeton some reference to some male,0.120890476
anatomy it's um it's thinly veiled and it's done in a comedic fashion but it's,0.05768007
there so I only asked for golga dodge I get so many questions about golga,0.046909414
dot as to whether or not she's up to up to this role and let,0.027712882
me tell you she is as much Wonder Woman as Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones,0.07099239
and Christopher Reeve is Superman from her action scenes too sitting in a bar with,0.04489125
Steve and his crew planning a mission to arguing with a British general one of,0.021555942
my favorite scenes in the movie every single movement from gal gadot rings true after,0.03740394
the action scenes while they are used sparingly they are masterfully woven into the story,0.02408497
I would say there's an Indiana Jones desk ratio of action to story and it,0.02468563
works just as it doesn't Indiana Jones but when there is action again it is,0.010643603
a wonder to behold and that third act boy oh I don't want to ruin,0.08350117
it for you we will discuss it at length in the spoiler review but let,0.020059278
me just tell you it definitely raises the bar and it definitely delivers and still,0.014840912
it manages to be faithful to this old-fashioned storytelling which is very impressive but I,0.03213768
have to also add that I actually enjoyed some of the quieter moments in the,0.02114885
movie just as much there are some beautiful and poignant things said and done that,0.014301448
are just so moving and also so haunting we have a lot to discuss in,0.015178826
the spoiler review these damn gauntlets I hope they're making too much noise while I,0.4655868
move Wonder Woman's like you know moving magic keeps my armor from distracting from my,0.065359615
dialogue but anyway I also wanted to add the Wonder Woman isn't just about taking,0.07422718
but and strength she has always been about also loving compassion and I personally have,0.017032692
felt that that it's held the character back in the past ivenn like you have,0.02443419
to choose you know I think that your love and compassion is holding you back,0.025979413
Wonder Woman but just as I said I enjoyed some of the quieter moments in,0.060851663
the movie as much as the action sequences that just that that embodies Wonder Woman,0.02915367
herself and I finally see the beauty of that balance between kicking button strength and,0.09924074
loving comparison and I not only see it as a benefit to the character but,0.012649798
it's a benefit to humanity to you to me and the fact that that movie,0.04949698
this movie was able to make such a strong impression on me and I think,0.061909307
particularly at this moment in time is really something amazing you know what I'm just,0.019861719
going to do it I'm going to take the dark night out of my list,0.25583422
of top three films of all time I've said before everyone has it's hard to,0.036001734
choose just one but everybody can choose their top three films of all time to,0.023828208
triangulate them as who they are as a movie goer and so I'm taking the,0.32836396
dark night out with all due respect and I'm putting Wonder Woman in as one,0.06484343
of my top three films of all time I just think it's that spectacular so,0.05009764
that's my review of Wonder Woman a film that I feel is absolutely perfect well,0.033457406
it has two little small problems which we'll discuss in the spoiler review but I,0.020999182
can't wait and discuss it with you down below if you're if you've seen the,0.1101737
movie do not ruin it for people save your spoilery comments for the spoiler review,0.035705727
and one last thing a lot of times you guys ask me to to your,0.05742464
3d and as I always say if the studio I let the student dealer's choice,0.025995377
right the studio put it in 2d for the press screening and as you can,0.019768592
see I had a wonderful time so that is what I would recommend for this,0.036120802
all right so much Wonder Woman coverage coming all week we are going to have,0.0631226
ourselves as I tweeted an amazonian time but right now in this moment I want,0.028860988
to harken back to something pretty amazing that happened on Twitter about a month or,0.051043533
so ago you might recall this woman named Karen Bradley her sister was a huge,0.20346305
Wonder Woman fan and she was unfortunately awful quite sick and it was one of,0.18414345
her final wishes to get the chance to see this movie unfortunately Melissa did not,0.08695746
get to see Wonder Woman but the outpouring of support that was shown to her,0.03283546
through my tweets and year tweet so many of you tweeted about it really meant,0.018738888
so much to her and I've kept in touch with her sister Karen and I,0.14321205
asked Karen for this review to tell us a little bit about Melissa send me,0.07251965
some photos that I can share them with you so that she could be a,0.038323224
part of this experience anyway and I have to tell you I was just so,0.014517633
absolutely moved by what Karen sent me I can't do it justice I'm going to,0.037188422
put it up on the screen and what I think it's just such an appropriate,0.04651962
ending for a review of this film because it fits so beautifully and it's just,0.13727728
such a perfect embodiment of sisterhood human spirit faith and the character faith and patty,0.04707704
Jenkins faith and what's in doing what's right that it is incredibly moving and I,0.04518792
think that particularly once you see the movie you'll see just how fitting and appropriate,0.054067455
this is so I again let's like Karen and her sisters honor wrap this up,0.055642612
