a timeline today is Wednesday it's about 11 p.m. and I just got done seeing Thor Ragnarok and I just wanted to give you my fresh thoughts on the movie nothing well thought out just what I feel like coming out of the movie now this being the third installment of Thor's,0.06574081
you know single movies his standalone movies this definitely had a better supporting cast,0.13271323
I feel over the previous two movies not to mention the tone was so much more fun,0.090162955
and there was good comedy there like it wasn't forced,0.08548937
it didn't seem like there was things that were just kind of there to break up the monotony of serious,0.08903968
it was actually a really well-written movie as far as the comedy is concerned and it did have this,0.096650295
you know buddy-cop vibe to it as you can see from the trailers,0.1071885
you had Thor getting stuck on this planet end up fighting with the Hulk and it from there became this like almost buddy-cop vibe of a movie and I really enjoyed it was so much fun and the characters were so good like some of the characters you didn't think were gonna be big players in the movie became really big players or really unique characters characters we saw him previously was I didn't really have much personality like Idris Elba's character we saw a lot of his character in this movie a lot more of his character in this movie in the previous I felt like you know he was just very kind of stoic this statuesque type of person,0.06454718
now you see him doing a lot more,0.079055436
I don't want to give it away,0.120735526
but he's doing a lot more in this movie that allow you to kind of see you know through his eyes a different perspective of you know what he does on the planet,0.15005015
now I will say one of the home run features of this movie is actually the kind of set design of where they are now,0.0510158
it's a car is a planet that seems like it's just the junk pile of the universe where everything is kind of you know gets dumped,0.6398326
and this set is just beautiful,0.061983634
it's so colorful really unique colors costumes things like that that's where you meet Jeff Goldblum's carrot the Grandmaster and he's like this,0.14100687
almost like,0.04945691
this,0.05212481
childlike ruler very childlike,0.45800424
I was like a very creepy psycho naive vibe to him but it works and the comedy between him,0.56182456
and Thor is just so good at like the banter back and forth you throw Loki in there and it just to another level like it was so good as far as the dialogue and we are introduced to a character named Valkyrie,0.116988815
she's incredible,0.07285385
I do not want to give more than that for those that haven't seen the movie but for those that have seen it,0.052334227
you know what it is let me know the comments section down below how you feel about her she's super fly,0.22612871
and please refrain from spoiling in this as far as the comments go like I don't want that down there,0.115557
if it is I'll delete the comment,0.08564398
now the villain hella in this is actually really dope,0.40311295
yes it is a little bit tweaked from the actual comic,0.2669405
you know backstory that she has but I feel of I feel like how they wrote,0.09719876
it for the Marvel Cinematic Universe I dig it,0.26228315
and I'm sold on it,0.11637581
and she was just based II like she was such a beast of a character and he saw her do some things that I don't think,0.4216556
he's seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was really awesome to see actually just her combat skills were just ridiculous and speaking of some things that we haven't seen there are clips in the trailer guys that have been altered,0.53490317
so they don't spoil the movie there's things in the movie that happened that are actually shots in the trailer that were CG completely different,0.08778023
so they don't give things away which iowa's so excited to see because I was like hold on I saw this in the trailer but it's different than the movie like I thought that was brilliant,0.09084644
so hats off to you Marvel that's actually really awesome,0.14158127
leaving my hat on though cuz my hair is beat under here,0.27624333
and I feel like in this movie we saw some really awesome action sequences with Thor I thought some of the sequences we've seen kind of rival or surpass some of the things we saw in Avengers Lourdes had some really cool battle sequences for sure,0.028520633
now there were a ton of Easter eggs in this movie cameos that are gonna lead up to the Avengers movie and stuff like that,0.14993514
and I will do another video on that talking about those things because I want to keep it separate,0.112274066
so as far as my final thoughts,0.10627754
on,0.040158812
Thor,0.044869266
I think it was a really enjoyable movie,0.07447729
I don't think it was a perfect movie,0.08006425
I felt like there was some times where I felt,0.104705796
they were a little bit too long insuk,0.5544979
I think that could have been cut down a little bit but outside of that like I felt it moved fairly well that was the only pacing issue,0.15585814
I thought for me where I was like okay,0.08321892
we I want to get off this planet already like and it seemed like we're just there a little bit too long,0.23965365
but outside of that guys like I really like this movie a lot by far,0.09836922
the best Thor movie hands down the number one Thor movie that we've seen whether it be story development where it be costuming whether it be action comedy just a better overall movie ranks in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,0.074965
it's really hard to say at the moment I would say top 10 for sure just based off of the enjoyment of the movie there's gonna be other movies that do things better,0.051082123
but I feel like the enjoyment I had in the theater with this movie was fantastic like I really enjoyed it to the point where I was like man like I want to see this again not to mention some of the after credit scenes were one of the after credit scenes,0.12084258
and some of the things that we saw in the movie cameos from other people from the Avengers was really awesome,0.078471646
