hey there guys John can't be here thanks for checking out my movie vlog I'm,0.05054265
in San Diego in my hotel at the moment in case you can't tell and,0.075335376
this is my quick review for the brand new Christopher Nolan film Dunkirk now Dunkirk,0.052279443
is based on the true events when four hundred thousand soldiers with their back to,0.03096563
the sea trapped on a beach completely surrounded by German forces that were coming in,0.15629753
and no way to get home and the concerted organized effort to save those guys,0.012012552
now a few months ago there was a lot of conundrum going on because people,0.0356126
found out that this was going to be a pg-13 movie and how on earth,0.08267102
can you do a true war movie that's worth anything unless it's rated R I,0.06767645
mean if it's going to be good it's got lots of blood and guts right,0.34087425
or else it's just going to feel weak like Disney as if there's only one,0.055927977
specific formula you can use to make a war movie to make it any good,0.079375036
don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong formula formula is good but sometimes break in,0.039439403
the formula is also good that's the case with Dunkirk because believe me this is,0.016366178
one of the most intense films you are going to see this year maybe next,0.026679186
year maybe the year after that the way Christopher Nolan sculpts this story is so,0.021809377
impressive look we heard early on from some early screenings of the film that a,0.015407649
lot of critics are coming out saying you know what there's not a lot of,0.03280952
character development in this thing it's not allowed you know immersive dialogue we don't really,0.019764602
get to know the characters very well and that kind of set off some alarms,0.035736326
for some people but what you realize really quickly going into this film is that,0.026347259
this movie isn't about any of the characters this movie is about the situation and,0.012195477
more than that as a filmmaker and as an audience this movie was about Christopher,0.019872362
Nolan wanting to take the audience and immerse them into a real situation that happened,0.058781613
once and let you naturally feel all the intensity all the tension all the fear,0.07829411
that that situation would have had it was about taking you plucking you out of,0.08142247
that comfortable seat and dropping you into the middle of hell and when the bullets,0.556787
are whizzing by and when the boats are sinking and when the planes are buzzing,0.053931095
overhead you didn't need to see blood to actually feel that terror you know what,0.13462318
this reminds me of and this is going to sound a little weird but follow,0.11175218
me here for a second it reminds me of that horror movie The Descent I,0.060928162
love that horror movie but what was so great about that movie it wasn't the,0.0425212
characters or getting to know them or the background whatever the reason I got so,0.011117879
sucked into that movie was the first half of the descent when their cave diving,0.50194687
and there you can feel the claustrophobic nature you're in there with them do what,0.042861775
they did in that movie was able to take you out of the comfort of,0.0489349
your seat and put you in that cave put you in that type spot make,0.14353466
you feel like you couldn't breathe feel how insanely scared you would be down there,0.23489396
because what they did was they didn't entrench you with the character at that point,0.027539933
they just embedded you into the situation so you could feel it that's what Dunkirk,0.02923615
does the movie is about taking you taking you out of that comfortable seat and,0.037955377
put you in the middle that war and making you feel it like honestly no,0.16514447
other war movie has ever made me feel it you know one of the truly,0.07181456
incredible things that Christopher Nolan does here you hear me say a lot for me,0.032669164
to care about action I first have to care about the characters if you get,0.016257754
me to care about the characters then the action has dramatic purpose and yet in,0.024404258
Dunkirk I never really got to care about any of the individual characters yes I,0.02589427
got to see Tom Hardy's great pilot yes I got to see Kenneth Branagh looking,0.03973275
very regal in a captain's hat and yes I got to see a bunch of,0.048849758
those things but I didn't care about the characters instead what Christopher Nolan did was,0.01633957
instead of getting you to care about the characters he got you to care about,0.018680353
the situation because like I mentioned before he makes you feel like you're in the,0.022481877
situation you're not suddenly but having the need to feel a connection to this one,0.04181943
particular guy in order to care about the action because you felt like you were,0.07620011
in it and that was all the motivation you need to care about the action,0.017271493
what's going on now I'm reading some people saying that Dunkirk is just all non-stop,0.037204385
from the beginning of the film to the end of images Moomba all non-stop all,0.07015825
non-stop and that's not necessarily true Christopher Nolan very intelligently throughout the film understands that,0.03157028
as an audience member we need to be able to catch our breath for a,0.03541571
minute now and again or else we just get fatigued with what's going on on,0.027907114
screen and there are very deliberate pauses throughout the film that give us that time,0.015205433
to catch our breath right before Nolan throws us right back into the fire again,0.11703507
the understanding of the preciousness of Hope the pure intensity of the movie having a,0.020131784
movie that's really able to teleport you from the comfort of your seat into the,0.028301569
situation itself are some of the reasons why Dunkirk is an absolute triumph now I've,0.01734666
been hearing some people saying that this is Christopher Nolan's greatest movie ever and I,0.044490807
can see why some people would say that I don't necessarily think so I don't,0.012374411
think it's the Dark Knight I don't think it's memento necessarily I don't think it's,0.020692533
as good as my favorite Christopher Nolan film insomnia but it ranks right up there,0.02302267
this is a truly fantastic film and it's a different kind of film it is,0.022408707
truly original how can a World War 2 movie be original and we've seen that,0.038016576
thousands of trust me it's the way that Nolan does the film that is very,0.026699806
unique and very original and I think is going to give you an experience in,0.025330193
the movie theater that you haven't had before but of course the most important thing,0.032323267
here is what do you think I know there are lots of advanced fanscreen these,0.020977896
