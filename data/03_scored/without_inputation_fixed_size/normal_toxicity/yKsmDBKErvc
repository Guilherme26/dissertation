black clansmen was directed by Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Ron Stallworth,0.0018257991
and this is the outrageous true story about a police officer from Colorado played by,0.07213007
John David Washington who decides to infiltrate the KKK and he does so by talking,0.19363408
to them on the phone but one of his fellow officers portrayed by Adam driver,0.09233325
goes to them in person and acts as his surrogate while Ron talks to them,0.23085396
on the phone and gets inside their heads and so they're working undercover to try,0.15268557
to figure out what they can learn about the KKK in the 1970s and this,0.13202538
is a completely insane based on a true story movie and I think Spike Lee's,0.34756047
best film since Inside Man I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end I,0.05567362
thought it was riveting but most surprisingly very funny I really didn't expect that going,0.057118956
in because I tried to stay away from the trailers I've been trying to do,0.07627943
that lately where I I don't see too many of the trailers or or know,0.07967549
much about the film going in and I found that I enjoy films or at,0.072545685
least am surprised by films a lot more in doing that so I was really,0.08160017
taken aback by how hilarious this film actually is and how often I was laughing,0.1541469
a lot of it is due to the interplay between John David Washington and Adam,0.047123946
driver then going back and forth trying to figure out how they're going to play,0.058061954
each other one of them's on the phone the others in person this is just,0.10409419
such a great idea and it's actually surprising the film hasn't been made up until,0.04350764
now because not only is it a very relevant movie for today's times it's just,0.071370654
such a great story and for this film Spike Lee has taken a considerably more,0.07271102
mainstream approach and I think that was a very wise decision because this film needs,0.06319093
to be seen by as many people as possible and to do so you kind,0.10671161
of have to adopt more of a crowd-pleasing element to your film even though the,0.102661885
story is very dark and in so doing I feel like a lot more people,0.067300536
are going to see this movie and a lot more people are going to hear,0.09045533
the message and understand its importance there are some historical inaccuracies throughout the film and,0.06707955
some things have been more embellished to create more of a theatrical experience and I'm,0.073346615
assuming that more than likely some people will find fault with that and thus say,0.06481891
this is a bad film or be angry about that but I've never really seen,0.18930143
a based on a true story movie that doesn't in some way embellish things or,0.058810398
try to make things more entertaining for an audience and that's what this film does,0.069460616
a few times and it didn't bother me I I never thought that it encroached,0.075277284
upon his message I never thought that it took away from the film I was,0.06868094
constantly invested and I had a great time watching it John David Washington I want,0.061212644
to see more with him there are many times throughout his performance especially when he,0.044781234
raises his voice where I was like wow you sound just like your father right,0.15041168
now and it actually gave me goosebumps a little bit but he really did step,0.27520442
out of what a lot of people might consider a shadow by being the son,0.12588653
of Denzel Washington here he owned this role he gave so much to it he,0.086907074
was impeccable his screen presence he was on fire this is a fantastic performance an,0.11332214
atom driver as usual was magnificent all of the acting in the film especially for,0.087893516
some of the KKK who I imagine were having a very difficult time saying and,0.17518027
doing some of the things on screen they really committed to that role and despite,0.02823012
how funny this movie actually is it somehow is able to balance the darkness with,0.061773803
that light so beautifully because there are scenes where I was almost in tears laughing,0.07765496
and then in the next I'm wincing there's a scene where one person tells a,0.069922455
story about a horrific Allah violent act and it made me sick to my stomach,0.50604486
and like that's the power this film has the end credits in particular I was,0.05342233
almost in tears and and so there's a lot to like about this film really,0.061591156
the only real issue I can find with it that that bugged me throughout is,0.07659081
that it is a little too long perhaps it's just there's a few scenes where,0.050776917
the pacing isn't as good as it could be but Spike Lee has balanced those,0.0865881
tones of humor and darkness so beautifully and I think that's one of the most,0.07620789
important things you can look at when you watch a film is how the director,0.067064404
has balanced the tone and it's just about perfect black clansmen is easily Spike Lee's,0.08044038
best film in years and I'm gonna give it an a guys thank you so,0.06126683
much as always for watching but I also want to give a special thank you,0.059935655

had the pleasure of meeting him and I just want to say to you Sammy,0.12431661
