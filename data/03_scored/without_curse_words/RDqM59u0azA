there's nothing that says i love you more than giving your boyfriend an old-fashioned on,0.45774463
the beach it's true love in its purest form moonlight released in 2016 and is,0.104358
directed by barry jenkins who has also directed such films like medicine for melancholy and,0.15444924
if beale street could talk and this film is starring travante rhodes andre holland janelle,0.15459056
monae ashton sanders jerrell jerome naomi harris and mahershala ali moonlight follows a young african-american,0.24948753
man who grapples with his identity and sexuality while experiencing the everyday struggles of childhood,0.47557485
adolescence and the begrudging adulthood and this film is the recipient of three academy awards,0.0854991
including best picture officially best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay which i'm gonna be,0.058783192
honest i gotta call on that adapted screenplay thing because this is based on a,0.07132505
play that was never published i i believe it the work has to be published,0.09211279
in order for it to be adapted and fall under that category so if anything,0.08374743
this should have won best original screenplay in my opinion and then films like arrival,0.09690251
or fences should have won for best adaptive screenplay that year just my opinion this,0.016289396
is also the movie that was part of the big like once in a lifetime,0.06405106
controversy at the oscars where the best picture winner was announced as la la land,0.058778323
and then for like two minutes it was the best picture until it wasn't and,0.09522787
they realized like oh no it's actually moonlight we had the wrong card we read,0.08668614
off the wrong card i remember when it happened too and when all of it,0.06985073
happened and they said la la land i was super happy because that was my,0.07195492
pick for best picture that year but there was i remember having this gut feeling,0.050417654
like something was gonna happen or something something like this was gonna happen and then,0.09634384
all of a sudden here it was did they ever announce who was fired over,0.0966381
that i mean that's that's something that's like okay someone's gonna be fired over this,0.18562892
it's nothing against you as a person but this was a humongous mistake someone needs,0.45516387
to lose their job over this oh whatever though i'm not going to look it,0.14180973
up instead i'm going to talk about this movie which is a beautiful look at,0.07377877
a very difficult time in a very difficult subject for a lot of people especially,0.079511516
of a younger age now i have my own baggage i am a straight white,0.19273247
male so that's the experience that's the privilege that i have so looking at this,0.24729021
film that just examines the black experience and especially someone of the black experience coming,0.12031843
up confused about their sexual identity i can only pull so much from my own,0.45328835
baggage so take that for whatever you will hey it's a white boy talking about,0.47815147
moonlight you can find it credible if you want or you can pass over this,0.057832543
review it's definitely your prerogative but i'm just laying it out there for you i,0.1522532
remember watching this the first time and i was kind of lukewarm on it there,0.12420667
were things about the film that i absolutely loved and i thought were perfect they,0.032067962
were beautiful they were heart-wrenching and there were some aspects of the film where i,0.047956996
was like this what the storytelling device just doesn't really make sense here and watching,0.06298022
it a second time for this review i still feel the same way the story,0.052549828
structure or the storytelling device that this film implements is this is three different separate,0.07637816
chapters in chiron's life the first chapter deals when he was very very young as,0.10054612
a kid chapter two deals with when he was a teenager and chapter three deals,0.12685256
with when he is an adult which sounds good on paper i think but in,0.25173038
execution it just felt like you hit a wall between each chapter in particular the,0.46217293
first two chapters this is when shiron is figuring out himself and figuring out where,0.07225104
he wants to go with his life and then when the screen pops up he's,0.15165988
aged 10 years and i go no no no i was i was liking what,0.07251407
was happening with the kid i was liking what was happening with mahershala ali i,0.083614744
want to see that connection more so in terms of satisfying the audience in the,0.050100975
term of storytelling the plot structure here it doesn't make sense why would you do,0.049633324
this it's terrible there's a part of me for like the first like five or,0.14429352
ten minutes of the next chapter that's just so angered inside because i was being,0.11924718
i was being groomed for what was happening in the one part of his life,0.15956146
and i wanted to see it and then nope it happened and now we're over,0.05459026
here in this chapter of his life it almost felt a little pretentious like oh,0.3496612
yes this is my storytelling device it's so unique to this film come on that's,0.1760158
that's not cool but i have a sense that i'm definitely in the minority with,0.09160464
that viewpoint on this film because this film is paled by many people by many,0.15127563
publications as one of the best films in the last decade do i agree with,0.0484226
that sentiment no it's good it's just not one of the best that i've seen,0.10565959
sorry well let me talk about the things that i love about this film jerrell,0.15173729
jerome who plays the adolescent version of chiron is magnificent oh my god i felt,0.112783894
it felt so hard for this kid this poor adolescent teenager who is hiding just,0.32311812
this what to himself feels like this dark secret inside he doesn't want to let,0.27469403
that out because if he lets that out he's going to be bullied and beaten,0.4559312
to an inch of his life and just the obvious depression and sadness just with,0.15063514
his facial reactions alone he doesn't have that many lines and it makes sense because,0.18737155
he's a quiet teenager he is struggling with his sexuality and how that has implications,0.49370098
on the culture that he is in there have been articles and there have been,0.09113744
interviews of the directors saying that the the black culture the black adolescent culture when,0.15413158
you are a man you're supposed to promote masculinity and to do that you need,0.36038682
to promote toughness and you need to show up your muscles and show aggression that,0.31089434
makes you manly that makes you tough and to some degree that's kind of how,0.0873384
my adolescence was too if you had any feminine or homosexual tendencies as a young,0.5154597
boy as a teenager you were made fun of and picked on it definitely happened,0.12464608
to me a few times growing up and it happened to a couple other people,0.08522908
in my school growing up as well needs to say i connected with this character,0.10585991
so much and i felt so bad for him he barely has any lines he,0.26738355
just he tells the emotion he tells the story with his physicality and with his,0.084971376
facial expressions this actor is exceptional i want to see him go on to do,0.36920205
many other things he he was great here and heck even when we get to,0.1854887
young chiron this little kid has the same tendencies he's seen as an outcast and,0.35531583
he's constantly bullied on by kids at school and i'll be honest the first time,0.5154597
that i watch this movie i didn't watch any trailers i didn't read anything about,0.11342101
it i just watched it and it took me a while to realize like oh,0.06879418
no this is about a kid who's discovering their sexuality for the very first time,0.40311489
and asking themselves questions am i gay am i straight what what do i find,0.5154597
attractive how would i know what i find attractive and that's where mahershala ali's character,0.07019059
comes in one hershali of course won the best supporting actor in this role and,0.053428363
he absolutely deserved it but it's annoying because he's barely in this movie he's only,0.4471463
in the first chapter you have such a great supporting character i wanted to see,0.07040431
where that relationship was going and then we go to chapter two and he is,0.10060753
oh again that's the storytelling here and i hate it because it leaves the characters,0.31089434
to tell us about things that happen or maybe ambiguously tell us things that may,0.0588938
have happened to certain characters that we don't see again anymore i hate it i,0.25300646
hate the storytelling here i can't get over it i love the child actor mahershan,0.50146157
ali is fantastic in his role as one janelle monae who plays his wife is,0.1503223
a stellar actor i've loved everything that i've seen her in and she's such a,0.18384373
kind-hearted warm spirited character that i i want to reach through the screen and give,0.18238027
her a hug and say thank you for helping this kid out because this kid,0.1770057
is being bullied he is such a what seems to be a terrible life thank,0.41385233
you for helping him and then we get to naomi harris's character who plays chiron's,0.11217021
mother and she plays a character that you just love to hate i hate this,0.5578966
mother so much she's one of the worst mothers in all of cinema putting my,0.77067506
foot down on that and kudos goes to naomi harris she is a brilliant actress,0.25308397
and she does an amazing job here what she does and the way she portrays,0.15291579
this drug addict of a mother who doesn't give two shits about her kid just,0.90294117
is looking for that next score to make herself feel good the way she portrays,0.11793072
her is so brilliantly done it was such a tight race with her and viola,0.4546246
davis for best supporting actress that year at the academy awards i would have given,0.08291695
it to viola davis too but god damn it naomi harris is a close second,0.85541195
it's a character that you just love to hate there's nothing redeeming about her at,0.3671391
all and she tries to make her son and sequentially the audience feel bad for,0.14933106
her in the final chapter when you see that she's in rehab and she's trying,0.16350895
to make herself better and have a better life you just see what she did,0.29623923
to shyron in the first two chapters that you go no you don't deserve forgiveness,0.14427285
you were a terrible mother no mother should ever do that to a child i,0.8606264
just hated her so much she was that damn good so good where i think,0.76881164
this film falls short other than the storytelling device is our final two lead actors,0.10489169
in the final chapter of chiron's life andre holland and trevontae rhodes they play the,0.07572946
adult versions of the adolescent versions of their characters and when they were teenagers they,0.06310088
did have a kind of hidden sexual relationship and here they are as adults and,0.551317
they're trying to rekindle that spark because they hadn't seen each other in almost 10,0.080459684
years and personally i felt no sexual or romantic tension between the two in particular,0.40254557
on chiron's part this this kid your former friend from high school he's the only,0.2180474
one that's ever touched you or lit that flame in you in a sexual or,0.63623077
desired manner and here you are as an adult you are on your own fruition,0.31089434
and you're seeing him for the very first time i do not feel any type,0.18034206
of sexual or romantic tension between you and kevin i just don't as an audience,0.6327634
member it's absent for me needless to say i think this film is it's a,0.21963988
good two-thirds of a film but then when we get to that final chapter just,0.054589793
kind of halts and all the energy at least that was supposed to be happening,0.059433162
throughout the entire movie i think we just come to an abrupt wall we never,0.11868071
keep going after that the cinematography here is beautiful the use of colors the use,0.07264308
of water throughout chiron's entire life is exceptional i love the little details and the,0.056320578
layers upon layers that everything that you see in each shot is telling you as,0.3309059
an audience member but again the final chapter and the way that the story is,0.052959725
told it just why would you ever do that as a storyteller you stop the,0.12384515
energy you stop the pacing abruptly and it takes a while to get that going,0.10551876
again and then when you get it going again all of a sudden we're stopping,0.049316
and we're fast forwarding another 10 years in this kid's life i don't want to,0.24493214
do that i want to see the transition i want to see the progression of,0.07666681
this character as opposed to being told hey here he is and hey here he,0.15547879
is again here he is again as an adult there you go give me the,0.14356303
oscar again there are great things about this film but there are also things that,0.0509278
i i hate about this movie and i know i'm in the minority with that,0.45633745
but this is my personal opinion this is my channel this is my review if,0.062301032

bruce willis is here and i'm fairly certain that this is like a direct dvd,0.08390716
movie for bruce willis which is what he's been loving to do in the last,0.10412564
