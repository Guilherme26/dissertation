hello everyone welcome back to my channel so what today's video is going to be,0.06858443
a little kind of do I want to call it a review I don't know,0.047353093
if I would consider it I guess it's a review right I don't know is,0.023782976
it a review you don't even know were talking about it okay well let's hold,0.07364913
a review because I guess it's kind of a review um what I'm trying to,0.02396324
say is I'm going to be talking today to you guys about the movie 8th,0.03350397
grade no I have here my boner my bo burnham shirt Boop can you see,0.63323927
it from my who do you okay are you okay okay coffee okay okay so,0.03899772
this is from when I went to go see a bow during his meet copy,0.023643287
show which was incredible I am a huge fan of Bo Burnham I have been,0.023876103
for several years now I absolutely love o Burnham if you know me you know,0.06667335
that because he is love him I watch him constant and i rewatch his same,0.07600389
specials over an over Doria like his songs like his you know comedy songs are,0.04894754
saved in my playlist of music that I listened to because because I love him,0.05934037
I am a huge fan of comedy in general and I grew up like with,0.017703863
comedy I mean I absolutely love it I love it if I have to say,0.08326569
I love Seattle comedian I could sit here and name every single Xena comedian that,0.032605305
has touched my life in one way or another but bo burnham is just absolutely,0.20409165
credible and that's everything I'm gonna say about that so yes maybe I'm a little,0.019396089
biased but I don't think so what I'm trying to say is since oh what,0.016730035
I'm trying to say is that laburnum so much when I found out that he,0.05034908
had a movie coming out which is the movie eighth grade I knew that I,0.041074425
liked how to see it as soon as it opened because I was very excited,0.06746293
and I'm he hasn't come out with like believe many projects within the last couple,0.030986914
years so make happy premiered on Netflix on June 3rd of 2016 and I saw,0.05003711
it in 2015 twice and then of course when it came on Netflix I watched,0.02772419
it like every day but after that it wasn't really much more that you heard,0.03229799
from him so when this movie came out I was very like I wasn't wasting,0.06978176
any time I was first in line to go see it and I knew as,0.016428705
soon as I saw it that I would have to make a video about it,0.043975957
and I knew that I hadn't talked about it because it was comedic in senses,0.052312702
of course it had a funny touch to it but it was it's a movie,0.023994504
that everyone should see let's just say that it was a movie but absolutely everyone,0.03549686
needs to see and parents need to have their children see this movie I mean,0.0374831
it is it needs to be watched it needs to be talked about it needs,0.023496281
to be out there for everyone to see it because it talks about real-life stuff,0.057501134
I mean it really does like it's called eighth grade for a reason it talks,0.04722471
about 8th grade it focuses on a young girl who's in raid and she was,0.16119994
going through real-life eighth-grade struggles I don't know about you guys but 8th grade wasn't,0.042039607
my prime time eighth grade was not necessarily my ear um I went to a,0.03801458
Catholic school my whole life and my school actually closed down in the 6th grade,0.27012452
so for a 7th and 8th grade I had to go to a different Catholic,0.038208812
school I had to remake friends I had to graduate with people that I didn't,0.02834414
know for very long I was the only person going to my high school so,0.02826831
I had to make these friends and then say goodbye to them all right away,0.04023962
eighth grader like wasn't the best and also aside from that like eighth grade was,0.0899468
not the best in my personal life I mean it was the year I lost,0.043067314
my father to a heart attack so like that was really tough on that end,0.10895575
of the spectrum but just in a very you know in a relatable way eighth,0.022208486
grade was just not great I mean it wasn't great for anybody I don't even,0.073262
know like trying to think about it I don't think eighth grade was really that,0.025604248
also more like that memorable or fun for really anybody um but when you're in,0.03571371
eighth grade it seems like your whole world I mean when you're living that day,0.21109603
today as a 13 14 year old kid I mean that's all you know that,0.056064337
that that's what you wake up and you know you're going to school and you're,0.09725517
going to see the Mean Girls and you're gonna see the hot kid that you,0.42389888
like and you're going to have maybe not one friend that like kind of understands,0.07036978
you but you also don't really know if you guys are actually great friends because,0.0392618
you know maybe there was a rumor going around or maybe something happened or whatever,0.033775363
I mean an eighth grade such trivial stuff happens I mean we all know that,0.033386234
but this movie just focused on those real life experiences and it really talked about,0.030976271
what actually goes on and it just it really showed what it is actually like,0.01791406
but aside from that I need it don't get me wrong it made me really,0.04232763
a very awful awkward terrible moment that I had as a 14 year old in,0.21594656
eighth grade getting ready to go to high school it was terrible but it also,0.05989912
just kind of gives you hope as an adult even just knowing that tough times,0.06697269
don't last you know as much as it focuses on all these bad things there's,0.035836767
that silver lining of the fact that good things like good things are possible and,0.017183024
good things will happen and 8th grade isn't the end-all be-all and I think that,0.051664814
goes for every every stagnant point that we have in our life when we feel,0.056429524
like we come to you know a halt and if we have a hiatus of,0.083060816
positivity if it seems like nothing good is happening and we're at a standstill we,0.025219107
have to know we have to know him to understand that those moments aren't our,0.026753021
ending I mean they're not the finalization of our lives it's just a tough time,0.17663354
and we get through it and we learn from Anna we grow from it and,0.058429066
we go on to the next moment and that's how it works but when you're,0.013802561
young eighth grade seems like such a big year because it's the last year before,0.04188861
you go into high school and I mean people are finally you're starting to come,0.085065015
into their bodies and and and we're learning all these new things and we're having,0.05197146
all these new experiences and it's it's a crazy time and it's an exciting time,0.065498635
in a scary time and an awful time and it's just took everything all at,0.044830717
once are wrapped up in tied to the bow and that's what 8th grade hands,0.06760461
to us but like I said looking back on it as a 21 year old,0.104000136
now I realize that III wasn't everything but when you're in eighth grade it is,0.043065984
everything to you I mean it's all that you're living it's what your day-to-day is,0.07445134
and it's not always great and I don't think it's a bad thing to say,0.025562342
that because it's not and that movie touches on every single one of those emotions,0.08426746
I laughed I cried I cringed a lot a lot but in good ways I,0.04834355
cringed because it was just so relatable and so truthful and so authentic it wasn't,0.018034458
a try-hard movie it wasn't trying to relate to younger kids it was just so,0.015005212
genuine I mean it was what every single person that has gone to eighth grade,0.09075699
has felt like and lived through and and been in and it was just it,0.025851697
was authentic and that that is what drew me in and as much as I,0.040501703
love Bo Burnham you know this was in a movie about Boober about bo burnham,0.108648434
this wasn't this wasn't watching him on stage and a t-shirt and jeans for an,0.055550817
hour telling those jokes I mean so it wasn't the fact that Bob Arnold made,0.023726435
this movie that made me love it it was how authentic it was that really,0.063922815
drew me in and allowed me to appreciate it so much more than I would,0.08575747
have if it was a movie that was just trying too hard sorry clip had,0.03140864
to come out but it was really you know mater's uh-huh but when I found,0.034180462
out that the movie was rated R um I was I was just kind of,0.02720069
really shocked and frustrated because this is a movie like I said that touches that,0.04352629
touches on all those bad things and it doesn't hide the fact that those bad,0.07048619
things happen and that III isn't a glory here but it gives hope on how,0.031370725
to get through that and how to understand that better things to come and but,0.037747175
there is always going to be positivity that leads after something negative has happen and,0.025018223
that is important for kids that are actually in eighth grade to see and to,0.025058798
know and to understand we shouldn't be taught those things years after it happens it,0.025705356
should be rated R for people who have already made it past that tough point,0.01984908
who already understand that and yeah it's a friendly reminder like I mentioned earlier to,0.018873256
adults to always be aware and always to understand that good things do come and,0.03026386
that negativity doesn't last forever but it's very important and kind of almost made for,0.013473295
eighth graders to understand that you are going through these tough times you are living,0.0715864
these sometimes terrible situations that seem like your whole life that seem like this is,0.11684084
everything that's ever going to happen for you um and and and it's important for,0.027637715
them to kind of see this because when you're when you're at that age or,0.048974145
when you're in those experiences and living those moments sometimes you feel like you're the,0.01851472
only person going through that bad moment you feel like you're the only person that,0.05602709
suffering negative we are going through a rough times and you don't understand all the,0.076101
time that other people and most other people are actually going through those same times,0.028574958
as well and you know we're at a point where everyone's trying to impress other,0.011534285
people are trying to live up to society's standards and that's a whole other topic,0.023530206
oh of course it all ties back together but you know it when we're going,0.03354388
through that we don't want to admit to these bad things we don't want to,0.03223214
allow other people to see us weak or to make other people think that we,0.086342834
don't have our lives together and I mean at 14 years old like doesn't even,0.10428816
really have their life together at 21 years old do I have my life together,0.046737134
we don't need it we don't need that but like I'm saying it's hard and,0.04477484
it's difficult sometimes at that agent at any age really but especially when you're at,0.033845875
that age because that's when everyone's really trying to fit in I mean middle school,0.028162545
is really the beginning of that in many cases and it started younger and younger,0.013626287
every day but it Grange is kind of the culmination of all of that but,0.076382376
you know it's tough to admit that and since nobody is really getting the courage,0.03349466
to admit that it's it's you know people are kids are ignorant to the fact,0.18460709
that other kids are going harlot so you seem alone in that feeling but this,0.2734573
movie really touches based on the fact that so many other kids are going through,0.039610356
it majority of these kids are going through it and that's why it's incredibly frustrating,0.031504426
to a viewer like myself who appreciates them to be so so much to know,0.053759478
that it was raining hard because the kids that really need to see it that,0.03837511
really need to have this understanding and this mindset from a young age that they,0.032486238
can get past it more easily and that they can be aware that at all,0.009157583
times and not have to learn in seven years later they need to see this,0.044680387
movie to know those things and to learn those lessons because not everyone is is,0.015609199
teaching them that not everyone is talking to them about that and a movie like,0.030458095
this shows it from an eighth graders perspective it shows it from a fourteen year,0.026285397
olds point of view so that's what they need to see and the fact that,0.031378042
it was written or it's just it's just it's just it's frustrating and I don't,0.02926675
even have words for because it's just incredibly it's just it's just so frustrating that's,0.04882847
like the only where they could come to my mind right now even describe it,0.04101323
because it just bothers me a lot so parents I encourage you to show this,0.0333849
movie to your children teachers I encourage you to recommend this movie if you can't,0.09651682
show it in the classroom I recommend that you guys you know tell your students,0.026029967
about this movie allow them to be aware of it because it is a great,0.055408467
film it's it has a great message it's wonderful for young people to see and,0.047346443
I think it's very important and beneficial and crucial for these young kids to see,0.069234975
because it touches base on so many things that they need to be aware of,0.027393593
and if nobody's telling them about it then they're not going to have the ability,0.04200169
to see and I think it's really important that they do so yes all in,0.0145788295
all I guess I'm just trying to say is I think April was wonderfully executed,0.10823336
I think it touched base on real life either in experiences in such a beautiful,0.034294873
way cringe-worthy way yes comedic way at times heart-wrenching yes of course I mean all,0.10397086
these things but it was so real it was so relatable it was so authentic,0.016810521
and so genuine and I absolutely loved every single second of it even the second,0.031417955
thought I was cringing because I know that that's how eighth grade really was and,0.069586195
this movie just it just did it it just completely completely did it and I,0.0303357
could not be more thankful for everyone who was involved we of course will burn,0.15373592
them for for making the movie and and and just you know of course executing,0.23014104
the movie but to everyone who had a part in it it just thank you,0.03763609
thank you for your time thank you for your energy thank you for being a,0.016712073
part of spreading the message and like I said parents teachers adults who are in,0.019967483
the lives of children you know in eighth grade or younger or in high school,0.15739974
whatever it might be whoever whoever you have in your life that might be going,0.16107754
through this type of moment I encourage you to really share this with them because,0.03233258
it could really really be life-changing and I just recommend this movie to everyone oh,0.090184934
thank you thank you thank you thank you so much for everything you've ever done,0.035848077
I mean I could make a whole other video on just the positivity that you've,0.12947933
brought into my life before this movie ever even came out I mean I'm talking,0.17403932
three years ago four years ago you helped me through a really rough time in,0.020024024
my life incredibly rough time in my life you were there for me without even,0.10007156
knowing that you are of course but your your comedy and your words and just,0.067762926
the way that you talk about life and just everything everything that you have done,0.027434833
and your professional career and just it's just really helped me it's gotten me through,0.028101347
some of the toughest times of my life I truly credit you with saving my,0.033998866
life and I know that's a statement and that's a it's very very intense words,0.028717974
but it's truth and I you know I love you for it and I could,0.023312027
not be more thankful for them like I said this is could be me being,0.045133375
biased but it's not maybe who highest it's really the truth a three-room is a,0.02572265
wonderful movie like I said thank you both for doing this collab to see you,0.045079496
