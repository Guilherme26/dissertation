eighth grade was directed by Bo Burnham and stars Elsie Fisher as young Kayla a,0.032347176
girl in her last week of eighth grade trying to survive because it's absolutely terrible,0.4323546
and her life is painfully embarrassing and this is something that I think a lot,0.43504596
of kids and adults can relate to if they've ever been that shy kid in,0.10297545
class or the unpopular kid trying to reach out trying to make friends but it,0.13567816
takes a different approach to it than films you may have seen like this from,0.06351982
the 90s or early 2000s and so much of this film relies on our hero,0.09445004
young Kayla and Elsie Fisher gives a star-making performance here she's totally charming completely real,0.104326494
and I basically loved everything that she brought to this movie I thought she was,0.13074434
so fantastic and the writing was also very realistic and very authentic for eighth graders,0.06694653
the film bridges the gap between acts by having her make a YouTube video and,0.062464435
we see a YouTube video in which she's talking about how to gain confidence or,0.090858445
something like that and then we see her dialogue overlaid over a sequence in which,0.07270105
we witness her trying to do something that she's talking about in her YouTube videos,0.14879559
and what I loved about that is that through those videos that she's making she's,0.175912
trying to reach out she's trying to connect we never really get an idea of,0.10808869
if anyone's actually watching her channel that much except for one person in the film,0.11092813
who mentions it but despite wanting to create videos about things like confidence or how,0.07903521
to be yourself she has a really hard time doing that in real life which,0.191109
I thought was an excellent commentary on modern-day social media I'm not sure if that's,0.05847888
what Bo Burnham was going for but it does feel like he's saying look at,0.066708766
all these people who are online telling us how to act or how to feel,0.14592996
but in everyday life they have no idea how to do it and I thought,0.099759065
that was really beautiful and the film captured it extremely well throughout the movie Kayla,0.03917409
would get opportunities to do things she wanted to do maybe she got invited to,0.07323956
a party or maybe she got to go out with some people a little bit,0.24068005
older than her and that excited her every single time something was looking up for,0.1786306
her in the back of my mind I'm thinking no it's about to crash and,0.31089434
burn this is so terrible I'm getting anxiety just watching this terrible flashbacks of eighth,0.2424521
grade oh my god and that's why the writing is so good because you always,0.135306
feel like the Hammers about to drop on this poor girl you never really feel,0.3983274
like she's crawling out of this introverted and very embarrassing phase that she's in even,0.4866659
when things are kind of looking up for her her father portrayed by Josh Hamilton,0.055386394
in the film I thought was wonderful he has some beautiful scenes with her however,0.15062633
his character does sometimes feel almost too good to be true like so much of,0.090039335
the film feels very grounded and then he's just the best dad ever you could,0.039303094
possibly have ever and it just it just felt a little bit fantastical to me,0.102880105
but it wasn't something that took me out of the film it was just kind,0.06831805
of in retrospect looking back on how authentic everything else was he did feel sort,0.11720259
of like impossibly perfect and the film does follow a formula that we're used to,0.029098164
seeing in films like this for instance there's a young boy that she has a,0.15377879
major crush on every time she sees him we get a close-up of his eyes,0.5535299
and some booming techno music which I thought was absolutely hilarious but there's also that,0.12925543
one kid who's really nice to her and in your head you're like yeah that's,0.47520837
the person you should be talking to you not this guy and we've seen that,0.24210489
many times in films before - but it's the wonderful writing the sharp comedy and,0.07333185
the commentary on today's youth that continue to make this film extremely entertaining it also,0.08035973
has a nerve-wracking scene in a car I saw this film with two of my,0.18443121
friends and I think we just held our breath for like five straight minutes it,0.16672222
was incredible extremely well done the film is definitely worth seeing it has great performances,0.053468477
