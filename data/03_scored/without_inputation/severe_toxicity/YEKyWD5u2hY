the page it also came from a really wonderful group of actors when I think,0.101538956
back on my favorite films in this genre that has always absolutely been an essential,0.030633038
ingredient for them again films like American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused those films would,0.07079217
not have been half as memorable as they were without brilliant actors like Richard Dreyfuss,0.055717114
and Matthew McConaughey and can you even imagine the film like Ferris Bueller's Day Off,0.06825715
with an actor not quite as charismatic as Matthew Broderick and the same can absolutely,0.05960511
be said for something like Superbad as well and if you did find yourself liking,0.08379651
and laughing at and identify with either Michael Cera or Jonah Hill and that film,0.05431823
in book-smart you'll more than likely adore benny Feldstein who's actually Jonah Hill's little sister,0.14532001
and Katelyn Deaver speaking of the performances and yes I do realize that I do,0.023777654
find myself repeating the same sentiment every single time that I see a film from,0.03928242
an actor turned director but every single time that I do it's just so clear,0.033734787
that the person behind the camera the person in charge of guiding those performances has,0.01883135
so clearly been in an actor's shoes before and here it was indeed very clear,0.043671302
that Olivia Wilde in her new role was able to pull from so many of,0.065279126
her own experiences as an actress to help guide her performers in this film to,0.017735792
uniquely excellent places but it wasn't just that she got good performances out of them,0.06795117
I thought she also quite expertly threaded the very difficult stylistic and tonal needle coaching,0.046100553
out of her actors performances that in certain moments felt very authentic and very real,0.03515562
and another is appropriately heightened and just fun but now I actually saved my very,0.01756617
highest praise for this film for last looking at something like Superbad I really watched,0.05538452
that film and think wow what a phenomenally directed film what an impressive piece of,0.030200003
cinema where the director really showed a mastery over the medium ensuring that he was,0.022120683
using the camera the lighting the color and the music to always immerse me in,0.09167561
the film and to be fair I shouldn't just pick on Superbad either really when,0.015657093
it comes to all of the kind of Judd Apatow comedies very rarely did they,0.053947724
do anything that heightened in the directorial department they're rather cut and dry meat potatoes,0.064630575
they just rely on the comedy found in the script and in the actors performances,0.024937069
to really draw us in and keep us engaged throughout the film but not so,0.013319638
with book-smart and Olivia Wilde's direction this first-time feature film director was absolutely on fire,0.11515393
so clearly out to demonstrate her brilliance as a visual storyteller in this new position,0.08946521
and she did so and did so beautifully there were so many sequences in this,0.03427159

like the last day of school which is exactly how I as a high schooler,0.04898213
viewed such things just that much intention and creativity was fantastic to see in a,0.11028811
