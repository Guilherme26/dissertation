knives out is the new mystery thriller from Rian Johnson,0.1487123
it's Agatha,0.09192868
Christie meets clue but definitely more Hercule Poirot than Colonel Mustard the father of a wealthy and eccentric family dies and a quirky detective is hired to investigate Christopher Plummer plays author Harlan trombe II he is a mystery writer who has done very very well for himself,0.254858
he is the patriarch of the family,0.063190706
he is the one who dies we learned that in the trailer all of his progeny are defective or at least less than desirable in one way or another Rian Johnson wrote and directed this whodunit that combines comedy with intrigue in a way that feels both familiar and new the ensemble cast that they have assembled is awesome but they don't all share the same screen time,0.1498274
we have Jamie Lee Curtis who's playing the daughter of Christopher Plummer Don Johnson is her husband and then their son Chris Evans who is doing his best to break away from his Captain America role,0.16584955
there's Michael Shannon playing a son and Toni Collette who is the wife of a deceased son,0.46770602
so she's a sister-in-law to Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon but she really she has no blood ties to the family anymore although Christopher Plummer has been taken care of her Kathryn Langford and Jaden Martell are also in this and they star as grandchildren to Christopher Plummer and rounding out the household cast as Ana de Armas and she is plumbers nurse,0.20800406
now there are three cops are really rather two cops and one private investigator likitha stanfeld is the detective in charge,0.062167805
I mean he's the one leading the entire investigation calling all a family doing the questioning there is a straight trooper Noah Siegen and then there is Daniel Craig who is the private investigator who is hired he has a wonderfully forced and awkward southern accent that adds to the charm and I'm not saying it as a bad thing because it really does just round out his character at one point,0.12196106
it's in one of the trail Chris Evans is like CSI KFC,0.06167726
and that's kind of what it is,0.057875574
he's got this just this Southern drawl to him that is just exaggerated but it really works,0.13145009
it's like molasses rolling off your tongue the chemistry of the cast is wonderful especially in their dysfunction as a family and I love how the story unfolds at the beginning all of their stories their accounts are cut together in a very entertaining way,0.1428122
there are a lot of twists and turns of this and despite finding out a lot that happens about halfway through the film they still hold back enough to keep it very entertaining and to just keep giving you misdirection so that you have to keep guessing the movie does have comedy,0.08984463
and it is funny but it's not overly,0.07942654
so which allows it to stay away from the goofiness,0.37230653
I mean there are goofy moments in there but they're very small and and far between,0.37545413
so that's why I said like at the very beginning of this in my intro that it's a little like clue but more along the lines towards Agatha Christie,0.1301316
I mean there's a lot more mystery to it with just a tiny bit of you know goofiness thrown in the comedy though is still there especially from La Keith Stanfield,0.3704737
he does some amazing looks and emotions with his eyes and he doesn't talk,0.1929616
but he conveys so much in these moments and it was just awesome to watch because you know exactly what he's thinking because we were thinking it also,0.110155955
and he is just confirming it for us,0.06847212
Daniel Craig and honored Armas end up being the leads in this which was surprising to me,0.06198828
I didn't realize they would have as much screen time as they did they work really great together especially when you factor into our mice's character oddity it's brilliant and awesome and a great addition to her character and something that I don't think I've ever seen before and so it was really it was funny but it added a whole new level to her character,0.067730606
and what she could or couldn't do as great that they work well together because they are both in the 25th James Bond film no time to die that's coming out in 2020 surprisingly Jayden Martell is barely in this,0.14875926
I mean he's more seen than heard even though he is the punchline to some really funny quips the story balance the characters very well,0.052028015
but like I said they don't all have equal screen time,0.06383603
which I guess is kind of a problem just when you have such a large ensemble cast that some are gonna take the forefront some are gonna have to fall back,0.068449125
and you just you trust the story and if it works then it works,0.05470651
and in this it works because it doesn't feel like it's missing anything,0.08026536
and then one thing that I really loved is that I didn't guess the outcome that's a huge thing for me especially in a mystery,0.077627495
because if I can guess it right off the bat or even partway through and then that's what it ends up being I just kind of been bored and a little disappointed I mean yay me but come on I just sat through a long movie,0.09891976
and if I guessed it then you need to write a better mystery,0.07322979
I mean take some cues from Agatha Christie she was really good and very innovative in the way that she would tell a mystery,0.11382301
there are a few moments that dragged a little bit,0.13092683
I mean the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long,0.08259543
but for the most part it seemed to move at an efficient pace,0.04441932
now one thing that has me curious like any good mystery is will it hold up to multiple viewings,0.06575009
I mean once you know who did it,0.080176115
can you watch it again,0.05699767
and can you still be entertained,0.13855322
I mean I think back to some of the movies where there's a big twist or a big reveal and maybe it is watchable again you know i well usual suspects,0.08398552
I love that one,0.06361474
I love the twist at the end and I do watch that one over and over again,0.080790415
even though I know what the twist is I guess I'll find out with knives out because I'm seeing it in two days from this date of this recording even though I had high hopes for this film it ended up surpassing,0.09453059
what I thought and was a ton of fun,0.07732118
if you enjoy mysteries with comedy and a great ensemble cast and I don't think you're gonna go wrong with this,0.13294084
one,0.052165557
there's no sex or nudity some violence and a lot of profanity I give knives out four and a half out of five couches,0.5154597
