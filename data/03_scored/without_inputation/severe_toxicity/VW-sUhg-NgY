film which is one of Pixar's most detailed and human stories so far it's such,0.05918804
an original ideal with the typical twists turns and heart-tugging moments that Pixar is known,0.0146300495
for this film may not have the emotional effect that up did in its first,0.02919491
couple minutes but it's a slow burn to a very emotional conclusion all I'm saying,0.11407633
is bring tissues the story is nothing without its main character the animation this film,0.061021954
shows why Pixar is the best in the business the intricate detail in the land,0.02019298

closer to reality and that's a hard thing to do and the story is accented,0.05426834

supporting character of the score into the forefront however the only net picky thing that,0.019707397
I can really say about this film is that it's the same Pixar mold that,0.030881152

very overdone and retold story but at the same time it's a family animated film,0.047627814
