now this movie has a Netflix movie but I didn't watch it on Netflix in,0.05271277
the comfort of my house I went to an early screening two weeks ago I,0.081318095
woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning drove 2 hours and sat in an,0.09800972
art house theater that had the most uncomfortable chairs in all of human existence that's,0.18778174
a small price to pay for a new Scorsese movie so now let's talk about,0.100551024
the Irishman the Irishman starring Robert De Niro who plays a mob hitman recalling the,0.24148136
events of his past and his criminal activity revolving around the murder of Jimmy Hoffa,0.18238482
like I said I watched this movie for the first time in a theater and,0.083056554
I'm sort of jealous of everyone who got to watch this for the first time,0.15254073
on Netflix on their comfortable couch and they got to pause the movie whenever they,0.116621226
wanted to to get up to get more popcorn take a pee or refill their,0.31089434
drink which brings me to a profound thought I wonder if anyone actually made it,0.09409744
through this entire film without having to go to the restroom three and a half,0.08678836
hours movie now let's talk about the structure of this film and it's typical of,0.14939773
what Scorsese has done with previous films you have a main character who's a criminal,0.4578216
and he's recalling the events of his past with narration throughout the film and by,0.026331069
the end of the film it concludes in present day with the outcome of all,0.057230648
of those events oh yeah the structure this film is very similar to past coursezi,0.096772976
flicks but I like that method of storytelling this film's timeline spans from the 1950s,0.083056
all the way to the 1990s and it all revolves around the disappearance of Jimmy,0.064911045
Hoffa who went missing in the 1970s he was murdered obviously and there's been a,0.2479045
lot of conspiracy theories floating around of what actually happened and this film directly relates,0.09741237
to all those events and centers around that and I'm a sucker for things like,0.4962187
that I love historical films and speaking of Jimmy Hoffa in this film he's played,0.06992663
by Al Pacino who's loud bombastic and he waits no longer than 10 minutes for,0.11525402
anyone and in my opinion this was perfect casting and I loved every scene with,0.09442135
Al Pacino because he just chews it up whoo-ha nlgger but the main character in,0.32860446
this film is played by Robert De Niro and he follow his journey from a,0.05957299
delivery driver to the right-hand man of Jimmy Hoffa and a mob boss named Russell,0.13437746
who's played by Joe Pesci and Joe Pesci always brings a smile to my face,0.097023286
just the way that he gives his lines in his performance I've been a fan,0.09237501
of Joe Pesci since home alone 1 as a kid but Joe Pesci for me,0.09707374
is really the standout throughout the film I just like the subtleties of this character,0.060314093
named Russell but I will say my favorite performance ever from Joe Pesci was in,0.10042145
the film casino he's just utterly insane in that film and I loved the little,0.37006685
things that he says when he's just beating people's heads and yeah that sounds dark,0.53678757
and morbid but I stand by it what happened in a nlgger tough guy told,0.3442927
my friend stick it up let's talk about the Irishman himself Robert De Niro and,0.09648214
what can i really say about Robert De Niro's performance it hasn't already been said,0.061886963
six thousand other times and a much more pretentious way than I'll probably say but,0.09307842
he's phenomenal as always it's Robert De Niro and in this film he is playing,0.15271325
the role I've character a Frank who did all this crazy nlgger for the mob,0.69542736
decades ago now my biggest fear going into this film was I was hoping that,0.105998315
the d aging effects would look convincing and not be distracting because there's nothing worse,0.18637714
than having great actors great performances but it feels like there's this blurry mess of,0.12353871
CG on top of their faces because the actors in this film are in their,0.10884613
70s and they need to look a lot younger because the film does span from,0.040600564
the time period of the 1950s to the 1990s and that's a long time period,0.07518654
to really de-age actors and make them look 40-plus years younger and does the movie,0.082660414
really do a good job of that it tries it really does try throughout this,0.04893343
film they do their best to camouflage the de-aging effect as much as they possibly,0.09258013
can for example when you have younger versions of Joe Pesci Al Pacino or Robert,0.08323805
De Niro in their 30s or 40s in this film when they're actually 70 years,0.060898982
old acting these characters they do their best to camouflage it with shadows or angles,0.14245793
or maybe not put the camera or a hyper focus up close to their face,0.3056965
and keep them in the distance and after 20 minutes into this movie you sort,0.1211767
of just forget about the D aging effect because the the actors performances honestly overshadow,0.06121713
it they're such good performances where you sort of forget oh this guy 70 years,0.10055229
old he looks like he's 60 years old with the D aging effect but really,0.08944787
he's supposed to be 30 years old so that's really my biggest negative from a,0.1604331
technical standpoint with the film the Irishman but with all that said I will say,0.07226402
the most jarring de-aging scene throughout this entire film was one of the first shots,0.11274153
we receive Robert De Niro keep in mind he's 70 years old attempting to play,0.07030831
a 30 year old driving this truck and the face does look slightly younger than,0.13903205
70 years old maybe years old nowhere close to 30 but you still see old,0.10810917
man Robert De Niro's body and hands and I thought maybe they should have tweaked,0.29408115
those aspects to really make it more believable now the Irishman is a mob movie,0.1910373
directed by Martin Scorsese and it feels like a mix of a few previous other,0.073910944
films like good fellows or casino blended together in this film and you can tell,0.11831665
that score says he was wanting to include all his favorite things that he even,0.097571485
puts in films or he's directed over the course of his career into one film,0.15111433
and just have fun with it every little trope that he's done and he's perfected,0.24174516
he put into this movie and I like that it felt like a culmination of,0.12997672
the best hits of Martin Scorsese now let's talk about the runtime of this film,0.15389995
it's three and a half hours long and at times when you're watching this movie,0.08790522
it feels like you're binge watching a really good miniseries and even in the theater,0.33765405
I was thinking to myself okay that episode could've ended right there this one could,0.12994933
start there this one could in there this one could start there and don't get,0.061154056
me wrong I love a slow burn I love an immersive theater experience that takes,0.1519526
its time it develops the story and gives you everything you want and more and,0.07822801
by the end of this movie I was fulfilled but I will say is the,0.069930494
three and a half hour runtime completely necessary you know it's a Martin Scorsese movie,0.08560563
Who am I to say he should cut minutes off of his movie I should,0.488197
have a slap my hand for such an accusation this is the part of the,0.29056844
video where I dive into negative as I had with the story of the film,0.08280221
and really my biggest criticism with the overall story of this film revolves around the,0.082204714
subplot a Robert De Niro's character and his daughter throughout the film and their relationship,0.03124188
or lack thereof because throughout the first half of this film you really feel like,0.15032294
they're teasing something to develop out of this relationship and have a payoff by the,0.07380945
end of the film and it never really happens you just you sort of understand,0.13653888
that they they weren't close but you you understood that by the first half of,0.14778566
the movie and it sort of just drags that same concept out into the end,0.08798916
of the film and it didn't really have the payoff that I think it could,0.030574758
have it just feels like it's sprinkled throughout the movie for the sake of being,0.056723595
there now very quickly before I give you my final flicking thoughts on this film,0.15936708
there is one technical aspect I did want to mention because I just found it,0.054681696
fascinating the director of photography of this film who did a phenomenal job this movie,0.11012509
looks beautiful times he did say throughout the film as it progresses into each modern,0.114106655
day time period from the 50s to the 90s he D saturated the film just,0.068504944
a little bit more as the film progressed and this was done to represent the,0.069670245
depression and decisions that these characters are making in their lives and how it's not,0.07547431
for the betterment of them as people and how as it progresses they become more,0.09373225
depressed and the audience should feel that same depression and I will say as I,0.12393253
watched the film in the theatre I did feel that way because it starts out,0.054910954
vibrant in the 1950s and by the time you reach the end of this movie,0.076697275
you just feel miserable and and you understand that decisions throughout your life really affect,0.7214038
the outcome and it does make you think and that was sort of the message,0.050731007
of this movie but no worries don't get too depressed before I give you my,0.12915468

the video and now feature presentation now here are my final flicking thoughts on the,0.06998414
Irishman this film is directed by Martin Scorsese and he still has the vitality that,0.06924512
he had 40-plus years ago this man is a master storyteller and he gets the,0.16104637
best performances out of any actors I've ever seen in a film and every movie,0.074778035
that I watch of his I am so captivated by it and the Irishman is,0.06331081
no different I was really fascinated by the real-life events with the unions and Jimmy,0.08132419
Hoffa and the things that went on behind the scenes in this film I just,0.07284219
I loved every second of it in all reality this film is sort of like,0.0824557
the Avengers of mob movies you have this perfect ensemble cast coming together to give,0.3030857
this great performance so with all that said I'm going to give the Irishman an,0.06671634
a is it my favorite Martin Scorsese film probably not is it his best mob,0.14950547
movie in my opinion probably not does it have as much rewatch ability as some,0.10124095
of his other films definitely not but this is a true piece of cinema and,0.117996454
it's definitely worth watching and I think this is a movie that will resonate for,0.07076304
years to come and it's by far the best Netflix movie ever made so now,0.061948955
here's my question for you guys and let me know down below what did you,0.2496509
