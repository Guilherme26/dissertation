hello everybody and welcome to reviews that don't matter what Jessica hit my name is,0.033594433
Jessica on today's episode we are talking all about Roma Netflix his latest bid to,0.022776553
get into the Oscars and guess what it did it got a whole bunch of,0.048787896
nominations and it's probably the front-runner now which is crazy because literally a week ago,0.056076977
I was like Stars borns the front-runner but somehow it's lost steam in about a,0.038878653
week and Roma has picked up major steam including a surprise Best Supporting Actress nomination,0.015264634
for marina date or vino I think is her name which her name has not,0.0322042
been anywhere in the conversation of Best Supporting Actress and it's definitely a little shocking,0.029153004
ELISA Aparicio obviously got nominated for Best Actress and she has kind of she was,0.0478287
kind of in that 5-slot wildcard of maybe sneakin somebody else in there but she,0.046391904
got in there you also have Best Picture Best Foreign Language Film I think you,0.047079705
also have Best Original Screenplay and Best Director and a whole bunch of technical Awards,0.011697254
I believe I'm pretty sure Best Cinematography which should definitely get there and I actually,0.02187789
think that it has a really good chance of winning that one but let's get,0.009957134
to what I thought about this movie I am surprised how much I enjoyed this,0.03640417
movie I I genuinely thought that I might be a little bored I don't watch,0.03530329
a lot of foreign language which is my fault I know and I also very,0.026650583
much you don't watch a lot of black and white Roma is a very quiet,0.2017655
story and there is a good like first 20 minute section of the movie were,0.019802516
like what is the plot of this like where are we going and then you,0.08654771
just kind of disappear back into the movie and then somehow you come out at,0.10639812
the very end just like really grateful for watching it it's a it's like I,0.019918924
said a quiet film but it speaks volumes it's a really corny thing for me,0.10517684
to say but I do think that is the case I think I believe I,0.019030904
haven't read a lot about this movie I believe this is Alfonso Cuaron's sort of,0.042730734
tribute to his mother which is really sweet I think that you leap to aparicio,0.2641602
I was a little skeptical of her because I knew that she hadn't really acted,0.06783011
before this but towards the end of that movie she's absolutely enthralling I do think,0.074126735
that Marina del Corvina I could be giving that last name wrong I'm sorry too,0.034934115
lazy look time to be I I think that she actually did a really great,0.24181834
job I watched Romo after I'd known that she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress,0.03232726
and I think she's deserving for sure there is a lot of those random movies,0.11052425
I have not seen yet so it's hard to say if I think that somebody,0.05272046
should win I think we all know Regina King is going to be winning for,0.02053688
Bill Street could talk and most likely Dame Judi Dench for the wife is gonna,0.037777774
be waiting for Best Actress one thing I will say is I don't quite understand,0.05497676
why it's in black and white I would really like to see this movie in,0.12222018
color personally I think that there are some scenes that it would really add to,0.024812015
it I feel like black and white kind of just adds that prestige Ness to,0.028874956
a movie which is really just like dumb which is why it like the Academy,0.2576473
Awards fail every years because they think that dramas are the only ones that could,0.024480755
ever be you know a Best Picture which is stupid thankfully it's changing a little,0.29615825
bit with you know Black Panther getting in there I think it's atrocious that eighth,0.30845538
grade is not in there and Bohemian Rhapsody is for Best Picture but you know,0.02308653
what some people liked it apparently this is also a film that surprised me in,0.03319865
the ending - with what happened to you Lisa and it was something I wasn't,0.028435936
expecting and I was like oh wait are they really doing this and that was,0.023080543
a moment in the hospital towards the end right before that final act at the,0.05106881
beach where I was like I'm really glad that this is not in color like,0.08938206
black and white makes this like easier to stomach and then it also is very,0.06733853
artistically crafted to make you feel anxious at times and in a way that really,0.015830705
surprised me as well considering this is a movie that really doesn't have much dialogue,0.02723927
and it's it's black and white and on top of that the foreign language so,0.043685935
I'm reading subtitles which sometimes you can get lost and reading the subtitles and miss,0.029160986
things on screen because of it but I didn't think I thought because there wasn't,0.013016979
that much dialogue it worked in this case and then that final act at the,0.020361936
beach with Alisa and the kids from the beginning of her kind of in her,0.040933408
own state of mind after what had just happened and the announcement that was made,0.018756848
by the the mother played by marina and then what happens at the beach in,0.029762313
a very much like oh no what is going to happen I mean you you,0.057389386
were just confronted with something that you thought was nearly impossible in this film and,0.017883463
then you get another moment you're like they're definitely not gonna do this right and,0.050430235
they do it in a way that that really like heals the souls of the,0.033739444
characters but also in my opinion the soul of the the person watching the film,0.022977438
because of just how hurt I think that somebody who's really into this movie gets,0.06007739
at what at one point and like how kind of just like shocked and like,0.016527819
almost bitter is a strong word but you almost feel a little bit betrayed by,0.08040407
this movie because you don't think it's going that way and then it shoves life,0.17073534
back in your face and that life isn't always fair and life is really hard,0.16749656
sometimes and then towards the end it kind of like shows back your your heart,0.044731606
back together in a really sweet way that makes you think that everyone's going to,0.03826868
be alright even though this terrible thing had happened and what I really liked about,0.048587672
this movie is it does not outright say anything like it really lets the the,0.02477809
person watching the movie fill in some blanks it has them kind of discover things,0.07367175
very slowly wonder about things it because there's not a lot of dialogue because we're,0.03275431
seeing it pretty much solely through he elites his eyes or Clio which is her,0.09850705
character's name Cleo's eyes we we kind of get snippets of snippets of conversations in,0.031572275
certain areas especially when it comes down to Clio she's a a main kind of,0.1131025
housekeeper she she lives in right next to this big house kind of connected to,0.10077998
it where her and her friend Adela I believe they're just friends there might be,0.052719794
cousins or something but I think they're just friends they are the housekeeper's for this,0.06267161
this couple who are both scientists one is like a biochemist and one is actually,0.049634673
a surgeon I believe so their doctors live in this really nice place and she's,0.049365275
part the family she takes care of these kids and you see at the beginning,0.020691868
there's something going on between the the mother and the father and then we kind,0.046778373
of don't visit that too much and we're looking more at what Clio is doing,0.023116462
and then you can another snippet of that and you're kind of placing it putting,0.060102668
everything together like a puzzle until the very ending where everything starts to make sense,0.03896313
then you start to escalate you see emotions boil over you see regretful actions taken,0.09781393
you you see the real loving care that this family has for Cleo it's really,0.035937212
sweet I would I would really recommend this to people even though it's kind of,0.05740934
scary because it's a four language film and it's in black and white but Alfonzo,0.03157826
Quran is one of the best filmmakers of our time especially working right now and,0.056541942
he just knows how to craft a movie really well and this is a very,0.021273239
personal story for him and I think that you know what I would not be,0.030690243
mad if Roma won best picture as well as because it's gonna win Best Foreign,0.06544476
Film and he's definitely gonna win Best Director in my opinion I mean you might,0.030201998
get Jurgis lamp the most coming in there's randomly actually is he even nominated I,0.21141665
don't remember it's a weird Best Director nomination like Bradley Cooper wasn't nominated I can't,0.019912938
remember if you're Atlanta most wasn't nominated they skip here freely which I Green Book,0.03830726
is the only of these Oscar films that I have not seen so I got,0.047677703
to do that before February whatever and but I do think Alfonso Cron's gonna get,0.028858326
a take Best Director and I think that it has a really good shot probably,0.1642365
the best shot at Best Picture but there are I mean a star is born,0.069922775
is still in the way green book I guess is still in the way I'd,0.027352352
be pretty shocked if green book won but there's still I mean in my opinion,0.036257166
out of the eight that are nominated I think black cap Landsman is the best,0.13473627
film it's what I would put towards it and to be honest as long as,0.06950837
Bohemian Rhapsody in I'm gonna be fairly happy oh with the Best Picture person with,0.03017007
the Oscars I would think that if Bohemian Rhapsody won I would probably throw something,0.090494245
at the TV but back to Roma because that's what this is about I do,0.016375491
watch it please do it's on Netflix it's not very long it's like an hour,0.067768246
forty minutes just pay attention to it put your phone down during this and that's,0.026981179
something that I have a hard time doing at home when I watching movies putting,0.046718508
my phone down and I did during this and I very much enjoyed it and,0.028841032
yeah I think most people can enjoy I think it'll it'll touch a lot of,0.06739308
people's souls in a good way and y'all Souls need to be touched okay I,0.4106817
