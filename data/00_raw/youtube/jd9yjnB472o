the best and worst of cinema on a weekly basis so a star is born is the latest adaption of this classic Hollywood story and this time is being directed by Bradley Cooper in his directorial debut the film of course stars Bradley Cooper as well along with Lady gaga and Sam Elliott's also Dave Chappelle has a small role in this film the story of course is something we've seen before the seasoned musician Jackson Maine stumbles across struggling artist Ali and as he Co acts as her into the spotlight the two begin to fall in love and naturally as her career is on the upswing he's is on the downswing and we see how it affects their relationship so unless you've been living under a rock obviously you have heard of a star is born in all the massive amounts of praise it's been getting recently it has been blowing up it has been called like one of the best films of all time I kid you not there have been reviews out there that have been hyping this movie up to the high heavens and when I went to go see this at TIFF I wasn't sure if he was gonna live up to all of that hype I was really nervous that he was gonna let me down a little bit and just be very standard and after seeing it at if I can't believe I'm saying this but this is a film that absolutely lives up to the hype this is an incredible directorial debut from Bradley Cooper and features phenomenal performances not only from Cooper but Lady gaga as well not to mention it also has one of the best original soundtracks of the year with some of the catchiest tunes that are gonna be stuck in your head for days even weeks after you've seen the film hell I'm still singing them in the shower and I don't even have the soundtrack yet but aside from all of that the focus really should be on Bradley Cooper because this is one of the most impressive directorial debuts I have ever seen Cooper feels very at home in the director's chair crafting a very raw and emotional story that is going to bring tears to many people's eyes it's very evident that through the time he spent working with all these a list directors he clearly picked up from them he was able to implement the knowledge he had attained into this picture the film is not only very genuine but it's an incredible realistic look at relation chips and to people who may be in the same profession vying for the spotlight and how that can affect a relationship but more than that I think what are the most impressive things about Cooper's direction here is how he decides to shoot it how it's blocked how these concert sequences really come to life I'm not kidding when I say that this is some of the best concert cinematography I have ever seen it really feels as though you are part of the audience in there when Jackson is playing his Tunes and even from the very beginning when you start hearing the hypnotic kick of the drum as Jackson enters the stage everything comes alive the sound feels visceral it sounds like you're at an actual concert and it adds more authenticity to what's going on and on top of that adds to the rawness and emotions that are felt especially when the duo is performing together on stage but what I think I like most about Cooper's direction in the way he stages these sequences is that even when there's a million other things going on when there's hundreds of adoring fans in the crowd when there's other people in a room when you have all of this external noise the focus remains on Jackson and Ally he's able to block out all of that and have your attention locked on the two artists in some of the intimate moments that they share while they're on stage that is not an easy task and I think coming from a first-time director it's even more impressive that Cooper was able to pull it off as well as he did I think what helps immerse you even more into the film is when you have such catchy original songs that also provides some great emotion as well I think by far my favorite sequence in the film and you see this in the trailer is when Jackson invites Ali on to the stage for the first time and she belts out this beautiful song that is probably my favorite in the entire film it's not only a great moment because of how it's staged but it's the emotion that is going on at that time and how the song personifies this this is her jump into the spotlight and you can feel the energy between the two on stage which is infectious I can honestly say that without the two of them actually performing on stage I don't know if these sequences would have conveyed as well as they did touch on the emotional aspects of this story because this is a film that by the time it ends it has knocked you on your ass it has affected you internally I know I started tearing up at the very and that's because of how invested you get in this relationship how invested you get in the characters because in a lot of these scenarios I feel like we can envision ourselves in the shoes of these characters we love someone but they're struggling through a lot yet at the same time you're trying to do what's best for you and your career and some of this emotional baggage may bleed into your work environment it's this visceral and relatable relationship between Jackson and Ally that elevate this film to being more than just your typical love story about an aging star going downwards and an upcoming star going upwards it really is more than that because the focus of this film and the heart of this film is the relationship and the thing that sells the film even more so than Cooper's direction our incredible performances you truthfully are looking at two of the best performances of the year Lady gaga a first-time actress completely knocked my socks off this is one of the best acting debuts I have ever seen she had such nuance and poise it felt like she had been acting for years and it also helps that she stripped down in such a raw manner that we haven't seen from her before and watching her transformation into this pop star such a great commentary on artists who are emerging and blowing up in order to achieve this certain level of fame it seems like Ally has to sell out a little bit and that struggle between her and Jackson over that fact I think is a great commentary on how people can change as a result of Fame and speaking of Cooper we have to touch on Bradley Cooper's performance next because it's not only the best performance of the film it's probably Cooper's best performance ever this is an actor who's completely recognizable and when you're watching this film you're seeing Bradley Cooper's face but you're not seeing Bradley Cooper his performance is completely transformative he really gets into the voice and mindset of Jackson main and the demons that he struggles with along the way feel so real that it's surprising that Cooper himself isn't struggling with these issues not once when I was watching this film did I look out and see Bradley Cooper I saw Jackson mane and that's a testament to how of a performance Cooper delivers here because when you look at a guy like that and you can look at the posters and clearly see Bradley Cooper but you watch the film and Cooper is nowhere to be seen that means you're giving probably one of the best performances of the year but aside from Cooper's performance I just find his character to be the most fascinating the most sympathetic yet you hate him at certain moments and the struggle he goes through with his substance abuse and the relationship with Allie I think is both heartbreaking and touching at the same time I was a mess watching this film by the holy [ __ ] and that's just a testament to how great 20:18 a star is born is it affects you in a way that when you leave the theater you're still thinking about it I know I'm still thinking about it I'm still humming the tunes I'm still picturing the moments between the two lovers and it's just something beautiful that doesn't come around that often this film is sure to get a bunch of accolades come award season Best Picture Best Actor Best Actress Best Director Best Original Song for crying out loud now whether or not it wins all those remains to be seen but you can expect a large number of nominations for a star is born and I can honestly say it is well deserved and for all those reasons and the reasons I've mentioned throughout my review I'm ultimately going to be giving a star is born supercharged seriously this is a film I cannot wait to see again I cannot wait for you all to witness this on the big screen it's going to amass a huge fan base and people are really going to be championing this film come award season but anyways I want to hear from you all let me know your favorite Bradley Cooper performance down in the comments
