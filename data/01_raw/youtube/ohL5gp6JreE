hey there this a match once again what about to another review this time of a quiet place which got a lot of good reviews huge box office seems like everyone loves the film and to be straight up I didn't mind the film but that was okay that was alright I don't think I'd never see the film again but I thought I had good acting it was a short film I mean you take out the end credits it's like an hour and 24 minutes without the inbred so it's not that one of a flake the premise is intriguing what if you lived in a world would ya be quiet because these creatures hunt by sound intriguing premise I like the idea that most of it is done with sign language made for a different kind of movie prepare two movies of late so it separated stuff a little bit by doing that I liked Emily Blunt as an actress I thought she was really good at you tomorrow she does another nice job in this as the lead John Krasinski he did fine as the husband / father he was also the director of the film there are some good-looking shots showing the the farmhouse they live at and I can't really say it's balli directed it is some good-looking shots it wasn't tons of shaky-cam or too much piss-poor editing or anything of that ilk so I did credit to the direction in the cast the ideas I mean compared with horror films and leads I would easily put this above the new it movie which are [ __ ] hated with that shitty new penny wise who did his [ __ ] Futterwacken dance where the hell was I diesel II put this above something like [ __ ] sinister there was a sinister sack of [ __ ] an easily put this above don't breathe which if it had likeable characters and didn't have BS like the turkey baster full of [ __ ] where you stick up a couch if you didn't have crap like that maybe I will like don't breathe more when I was really mixed on but if I had to choose I say I would dislike it more than like it but I would put a quiet place above that then have funny turkey basters won't come and villain that was pretty much daredevil but there have been films in the past that dealt with hunting by sound you had tremors love tremors when my favorite films ever and that was vibrations from the ground so to really don't make noise or you'll die love tremors to death you had the descent when they went to the cave these monsters didn't really hunt by sight he lived in a cave they hunted by sound and I would easily put tremors into the scent above this now the simple descent part to didn't go [ __ ] itself [ __ ] scene where literally a monster shits on its main characters so I know that's faint praise a quiet place is better than the descent part - it's one of those things where I didn't the cast and they were good but something about this movie just seemed so uneventful to me I don't know what it is like some parts of the phone remind me a lot of signs by M night Shyamalan and I was there brother watch signs despite the bolt the stupidity of the water but why the [ __ ] where they come to a place if water was acid to them although here there's a thing one Mike really okay I'll get to that but I don't know just for some reason it just didn't feel that it's hard for me to get stared at movie or anything I'm not saying that's the pump myself up it's just one of those things and I just found a sort of uneventful I don't know why it monsters on a farmhouse I mean I could watch [ __ ] critters for that order will watch plenty of other movies for that the monster designed and doing it for me they almost seem like the liquors from resident evil which they hunted by sound to Ashley because they have eyes so there was only shitty liquors from Resident Evil games so the monsters did impress me the the end beam was kind of it wasn't downbeat it was just like wait that's how you don't end it like you're waiting for like 10 15 more minutes apt and and then it ends you're like what though that was lame I did it's an okay alright movie I do feel some overrated film to CERN how much prep praise and it's one of these things I'm getting [ __ ] tired of this this bullsh and what every [ __ ] horror film comes out this is tears movie ever and I fainted and I had a heart attack oh my god stairs every [ __ ] in two months they did they went for the witch the babadook for the witch [ __ ] that movie you Baba dude I didn't see to be fair but they different city is they did that for sinister which I'm like [ __ ] this police I did they were stinking in every horror file that comes out now but yet I if I go on Netflix I saw this one called the ritual last not too long ago it came out last year on Netflix I liked the ritual a lot I would easily put that above something like this I liked the story more I like the the ending more I liked five I came out on Netflix like the ritual put above this mmm but that's a film no one knows about zero you know conversation well I I saw him when we recently called exists which I reviewed it's a final footage bid for a movie sure but I like that feel much more than this and FM that [ __ ] on my critics and no one saw us about that film but that one I felt more events and felt more I would just felt more like this one that and some of the [ __ ] that happened bud me analyst let me die money on spoilers just discern how much money made it seems like everyone saw the film and all is not a rant believe me if I wanted to rant on it I'll rant on something Steve means it which everyone praised from last year I [ __ ] rant on and cuz I thought it was a [ __ ] show a [ __ ] sandwich I didn't want to eat but this one there in this empty town and it's three kids Emily Blunt and her husband John Krasinski granted I don't know why the [ __ ] they're bringing their kids around in the town why not just leaving the [ __ ] home with the husband and the wife go out or leave him with the wife and the husband go out I don't know why the [ __ ] you would take your kids the Walgreens or where the [ __ ] you got one just just knows it'll be trouble it seemed like they went out there for some supplies and medicine and again I'm thinking why the [ __ ] are you taking everybody out you have this home and they even have this like basement where well I guess technically ones like day 89 yells like a 400 something so maybe they didn't have the house yet I don't know maybe that's why they didn't have the house yet I would assume they did is there taking all this other electronic I don't know maybe they didn't Alamo they didn't really give me much detail as to whether they had a house or not it just seemed like we're like you're leaving your kid doing all this [ __ ] keep more of an eye on your [ __ ] kid yeah or if you have a house [ __ ] stay there so what happens the kids playing with this [ __ ] toy he just killed and the tiles come up because the parents [ __ ] up it's Dave for enduring something they talked with sign language so no dialogue not much dialogue in the film entirely that was an interesting idea I like that it made it unique compared to again like I said compared to films recently that was cool they have their dinner they play Monopoly the kid accidentally knocks his lantern over and there's wandering and things coming for some reason this couple decide decided to have another kid I guess oh my so wait a minute what this way that [ __ ] is going in the world you decide to get pregnant again I'm like all right does it make me ask twice about this world when you [ __ ] do you have silent [ __ ] or do you put like a daddy in each other's mouths now maybe people [ __ ] with no noise but or maybe they fought in the basement with the soundproofing I don't know what does it make people why don't everyone just go and the soundproof all the time like when you have dinner while you have dinner in the soundproofing basement so you can get more leeway for dishes like why you want to do everything the soundproof basement I'm just asking a question if this soundproof basement you worry about noise just do everything there play your games there you know brought in technically live in the basement of a soundproof but but then do you have sign on 14 do you [ __ ] with no noise it'd be hard to do and how you don't know you know they do kind of quiet a babe I mean how the hell they don't quite a baby and then later on there is a baby oh you put a [ __ ] mask on it and you put on the [ __ ] box I'm like well [ __ ] man you should have had the baby in the first place then if you don't give it a little [ __ ] mask and put it in a [ __ ] box as if you put away your [ __ ] video games or something this little box but I might well this kid's gonna cry a lot so in a world that you don't want noise I don't think being pregnant should be you know something you should do especially within like the first year of the [ __ ] going on do you think it was like Davey nine so that's almost like three months and that's a year later given you know maybe five years and then maybe try to have a kid just saying no just some stuff I'm like so the dad tastes the kid to fishing and he says something like well we can made noise here and he does a whoo-whoo because this waterfall I'm like this waterfall okay why don't you just live by the [ __ ] waterfall then when you just live by the waterfall live in a [ __ ] K by the waterfall or something but so they have this apparently with the waterfall they they can't be heard because I guess the waterfall I and the river is well not just a waffle but the river stops there they're noise mainly the waterfall so this weird random what the [ __ ] scene honestly should have been in the movie my opinion the dad Center coming back from fishing and the waterfall scene and this random old guys there with this with and his wife is dead the dad grows this literally the old god mace like lady ate some bad like bad food oh he smelled like a ranked fart he's even like he's an old man he's trying to find his teeth do I have teeth flat like he made like a weird face that made me laugh like and then just how blue this guy told me to shut up about he wasn't saying anything until the guy went and then it's like and then of course they run and the creature kills the old guy the [ __ ] was this scene about I didn't he was staring out that was pretty funny like what the [ __ ] I was right and um Emily Blunt she's by herself she's ready to give birth prematurely she tries to get down quit she steps on the nail something falls she has to hide creature stalking her Emily Blunt does a good job acting wise cinematography is nicely done she turns his faint on red light to warn people the girl who play the daughter she felt bad for what happened to her brother long ago and she's like at this little grave thing sort of a spot to memorialize him and like bits that they do without dialogue I still didn't they still gave the emotion of the characters - idea of that's one of the things I could say that made me like the film ok overall was the cat was the group of actors the use of sign language being that sort of dealing with silence and having not much dialogue in it in the entire movie at all I mean if there's ten lines of dialogue in the film that'd be a surprise and I didn't that's one of the things that's intriguing about it but then kids run around the cornfields I don't know that just made me think of the film signs which I did I'd rather be watching signs she did birth in this bathtub the father comes in they're alive the baby's alive they put this little mass and they put the baby in a box turn the baby again the basement is being flooded these kids are in the silo the dad tries it on for the two kids he gets wounded he made some noise for self-sacrifice and I'm thinking I know you're wounded but why are you at least try running or just throw something don't run just you have a you dropped an axe why don't you throw the axe that'll make some sound enough for the kids I get out of there I mean it's gonna kill you in 30 seconds if you throw the actors don't get there in 30 seconds so the self-sacrifice only was needed I get for the emotional idea cuz the father the daughter when I seen eye to eye and he sign languages I love you so I and emotionally I the emotional idea of the story I did but it was like you just dropped a thing you try thrown for the creature that go over there when these kids were in the silo they were trapped and the creatures attacking them and when you see throughout this is that the the little girl the girl has his hearing aid thing as high frequency [ __ ] with the creature so after the dad's killed by so sacrifice that a mic I think you've heard down something else in those the two T's did to the mom they get to this place where the dad would try to radio or at least see if there was any frequencies working the creature comes in again I'm not a fan the creature design it was just very mediocre I'm not an original again it looked like a [ __ ] shitty liquor from the resin Resident Evil games again they do hunt by sound - just a generic look that's the worm what is a generic looked on the creature I'm where I'm waiting for Jill Valentine to come out and shoot the [ __ ] or Chris Redfield really I should say Chris Redfield or no well yeah res evil five he fought them oh sure said Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield was the first time my son wasn't evil to see IRA I'm talking more about that yeah she said Leon Kennedy but she [ __ ] with the frequency and that messes up with the creature I guess it makes part of its head exposed so that when Emily Blunt shoots it with a shotgun a blows the head up CG I was in kind of wish they'd gone for a more practical route cuz I know they had a somewhat lower budget so the CGI wasn't on the creature and then I know my friend Michael Keene mentioned this like how the [ __ ] is it that none of the scientists in this world knew this frequency thing would work yet this little girl figures it out fairly quickly and within one night and I'm like that would have been one of the first things that scientists would have done like they hunt by sound oh [ __ ] frequencies of course should have had us and then we've seen a lot of movies why movies I deal with sound whether it be alien invasion movie suddenly usually does were frequencies hell even Mars Attacks did that where they that yodeling music made their heads blow up so alright just seemed like a pretty quick easy answer to the problem and then the ending is that really an ending it's almost as if there should be a to be continued because multiple creatures come in there are coming the little girl gets the frequency you know equipment loaded up Emily Blunt costs the shotgun and then the movie ends and I like so what now like what that's it so I know it seems like I've been ranting a lot but I'm just throwing out my nitpicks in there you cold nitpicks yeah but I'm just the one on my nip it's in there and I think this Athene is that yeah every film is without sin every film has their nitpicks it's just uh there's not gonna be rant people don't say well you just don't want to ranches you don't want to get in trouble please me I've got in trouble a lot many times in the past and many times in the future I will this it wasn't like a terrible time watching it wasn't like a board to sit through it wasn't oh my god I hate these characters the characters were fine the acting was good the idea was intriguing the directionless handled competently the lack of dialogue made it more interesting than the norm and overall it was a enough movie that didn't feel like it was a huge waste of time eighty some Menace boom you're out you know it's worth a watch absolutely I just don't see why would ever we watch the film and I would the idea not to put I would put tremors above it I put the dissent above it overall it's an OK but I feel overrated film I didn't think it was that Styria didn't think it was that suspenseful I didn't think it was terrifying I thought the creatures were generic designs I know our pian this the third time but they seem I'm lickers to me parts of the storyline huh and the ending was just sort of a almost a [ __ ] ending anyway okay movie saw wands probably never see it again that's a quiet place so either way thanks for watching take care and we'll see you later bye bye
