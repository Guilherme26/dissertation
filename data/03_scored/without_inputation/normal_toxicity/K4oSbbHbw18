hey what's up,0.10114926
everybody today we're talking about the comedic drama called the favorite directed by your ghost land the most the cast is headlined by Emma Stone Rachel Weis and Olivia Colman I'm gonna let you know where this film thrived I'm gonna let you know where it fell short and I'm gonna give you my opinion on if I think it was a successful film,0.13268353
so let's get into it historia said in eighteenth-century England it focuses on Queen,0.09100577
and played by Colman she's in weak health,0.1444404
she has an unpredictable temper as well and in her place Lady Sarah played by Rachel Weisz governs the country while also tending to the Queen's well-being and this is a dynamic,0.1058004
that's complicated when a new servant named Abigail played by Emma Stone enters the picture and begins to meticulously insert herself into the relationship which naturally causes a lot of issues the style of director your ghost,0.10806667
lanta MOS is definitely an acquired taste,0.18968467
I don't think his films are aimed towards general audiences either,0.13965307
but regardless of that I think he routinely crafts some highly artistic films that always captivate me to the point where I'm not often sure whether I liked or disliked,0.2669375
what I had just seen which is something very odd for a person like myself who virtually has an opinion about everything in terms of his overall body of work,0.104593754
I would say this is easily as most consumable film it's his most straightforward project but I definitely think it still had some of the hidden elements in the narrative that provoked a lot of thought which I always do appreciate from him it also had some beautifully polished visuals that I really love from his direction and his artistic eye,0.08656586
I think he did a great job of giving the camerawork a personality of its own in this story that just complimented the tone perfectly most often he has the camera lower shooting up at the characters to give them a stronger on-screen presence this framing of the shots is also really able to capture all the ornate detail of the backdrops at all times he also positions the camera to frame the walls on longer angles which just provided a ton of depth throughout the film and it routinely pulled me into the scenes in the rooms with the characters he also made interesting use of a fisheye perspective to create kind of a stuffy feeling that fit the atmosphere of the story very well he complements that with simple camera pivots to follow the characters and it really helped me feel and connect with the mood of each scene which I found subtle but highly engaging,0.08460432
I thought the makeup and the wardrobe design were flawless the cinematography from Robbie Ryan just complimented the direction perfectly about the lighting did a great job of fitting the tone of each scene perfectly to just heighten the emotional reaction,0.07942674
I thought the score was this subtle but impending and it did the same in terms of just bolstering the film when needed I very much,0.04170079
enjoyed the progression of the storyline,0.078881405
it develops the relationships between all the focal characters with a nice flow,0.06424384
it touches just enough on the state of the country,0.11232642
and the governing issues that are going on behind the batch up of all these relationships nicely,0.07627643
it gives a lot of weight and meaning to certain scenes,0.12139687
and for me I was able to find the story to be more than compelling enough to hold my attention,0.07369403
I thought it had enough explanation to it but it also had many implied meanings,0.056940403
and I thought this balance of both is why this could easily be the most mass consumable film from land the most who I think is a fantastic director from a technical aspect,0.09988519
but as good as the story was it's the lead trio of performances that make this movie worth a watch wise stone and Coleman are all at the top of their game in this movie the performances are filled with layers of emotion and intensity and I was really able to invest in each of them for their own reasons the chemistry between one another was fantastic as was their timing,0.051219895
and the result was a collection of character dynamics that hit with a lot of impact because they felt genuine in their build up Rachel Wise was excellent,0.05214137
she thrives in time period pieces and she did in this one as well she was just unassuming one minute and so matter-of-fact and blunt and callous the next she showed strength and vulnerability with a nice balance,0.09518411
and when it was called bond she hit some very emotionally charged scenes with a very smooth capable delivery,0.15194382
and as the story progresses and control begins to be threatened by her character,0.18472388
she's really forced into some emotional positions and Weiss portrays it all with a fascinating literalness that I just found very appealing and I thought Olivia Coleman was much the same as the story evolves we learned more about her capability in the position of being the Queen as well as her mental state her health and her mental strength are just slowly deteriorating and Coleman really captures this range of distress impeccably,0.31343022
I thought this vulnerability is what allows a manipulative person into her bedroom and into her heart so to speak and I thought the way Coleman captured this conflict was just impressively genuine,0.26858643
and as you would expect emma stone did not disappoint either she was easily the most interesting character there were so many different sides to this role throughout,0.06792094
the course of the story and I thought stone really nailed all of them with perfection through her facial expressions her mannerisms and the delivery of the dialogue I thought she perfectly captured her characters just methodical manipulation just as the story needed it to she was charming and calculating at all times and with stones performance I was just completely intrigued by what her next move would be and I found the unpredictability to be very refreshing,0.10610147
nicholas hoult comes in and provides a great supporting performance as well and overall,0.07393219
I think everybody did a great job in their roles,0.07524191
I thought the dialogue was just nicely,0.045160767
written,0.057434022
it was sharp witted the humor was very clever,0.3597728
I routinely was laughing and chuckling from the back and forth between the characters some of the laughs because of the genuineness of the material and the Frank delivery from the performers other laughs coming from just the timing of the situation's of a given scene and like you would expect from the lanthum of film some laughs just out of simple awkwardness from the sexual imagery,0.35349366
this is where I think general audiences could sort of disconnect from this movie a bit some of the dialogue felt more worded for shock value than it did genuine lanthum oohs also likes to slip implied masturbation and forced nudity into his films,0.6364068
and that's his choice,0.059540518
the humor though is routinely timed with the effective satire some of the sexual implications,0.4744774
in this story are without question needed for it but some are simply not,0.053462904
I don't think a panning shot of a character walking past a row of women,0.37940538
lined up along the wall all with their breasts hanging out has much of an impact on the story and no matter how artistic you try to make it,0.6644321
the result is gratuitous and not much different than this,0.09906864
no I'm not judging much like when I was younger some kid down,0.12556162
the road is gonna be watching HBO,0.05763507
one night,0.06421341
he's gonna see this movie and it's gonna be his first movie he ever sees but these are scenes that are gonna rub a large portion of audiences the wrong way who may not be familiar with lanthum OSes body of work,0.15303291
but overall I found it to be a very good film that had me engaged from start to finish,0.14874049
and the favorite from me is gonna get 85% on the entertainment meter both the characters and the plotline continually evolves with an intriguing flow that kept onto my interest it's a beautifully crafted film but some people may be turned off by the forced sexual subject matter that doesn't seem to be moving the story forward,0.29321086
and some of the dialogue that those who tend to love traditional time period movies may be very surprised by if they go into this movie without doing their research,0.07118764
