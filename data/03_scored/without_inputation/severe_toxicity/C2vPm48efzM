oh no Martin Scorsese film all right we're finally here without a word by been,0.04385423
booming said ello Rubicon that's right was insane here and we are here for another,0.04884909
Bowman review for finally a new Martin Scorsese film the Irishman which is on Netflix,0.060686033
not that you can actually go stream which is a three-hour and plus epic which,0.035637878
of course stars none other than Robert DeNiro John pesky and Al Pacino or cappuccino,0.041530076
whatever a jack-and-jill but mostly focusing on the story of these men here from Frank,0.09570396
Jimmy and Russel Frank of course who just won from you know Dublin truck scene,0.03082328
they're just doing simple jobs that aren't working for the mobster and working on the,0.08727143
Russell and we get to see through the life a perspective of him tours commentary,0.041452914
alongside these gentlemen in this very long epic film here the irishman martin scorsese one,0.13394271
of the most legendary iconic filmmakers we have of our error not the guy that,0.040328752
you've been hearing Trent for months about his comments of MCU films a man that,0.05586146
has established himself as one of the most innovative and most assertive directors in the,0.012681061
style of form of what he has brought behind the genre of just suspense of,0.04308062
either his dark comedy of flushes at times but mostly films like this upon his,0.12510176
mops in themes of such a if you compare it to Goodfellas which this film,0.16866064
is inevitable to compare and I can truly say that as far as foams like,0.027446808
this and it's kind of a great highlight moment for Netflix to kind of get,0.019430013
someone of a caliber of what Scorsese as what was having this first time of,0.0456908
this trio of robber and Joe coming out of retirement and Al Pacino on the,0.1266922
phone together because obviously the last time we had a such of Robert and Al,0.016760632
Pacino collab right just killer I wouldn't say it was one of the best of,0.16183785
moments probably blood that we got this year but a long side award season and,0.03243103
alongside the fact that with a lot that comes into play with a film like,0.03300242
this would easily be the biggest budget that Martinus at the helm as well as,0.03483966
it obviously being the long epic that it is which passes endgame is the longest,0.0405915
moment of 2019 it is understandable for those that don't really go on the weekly,0.030142797
basis of us you know certainly themselves to kind of in do the movie experience,0.029997787
and sitting through it that maybe something like this could seem a bit long to,0.049581457
them and maybe you might have to separate this into such a series breakdown after,0.03990237
breakdown I'm just the people that I look from the perspective of how people can,0.061489575
sit an entire day and stream a TV show or an entire season but they,0.01790608
can't sit through just a 3-hour movie maybe that's just me you of course I,0.03288535
Robbie Robertson of course is the long collaborator for Martin Scorsese returning after decades of,0.038658477
collaborating and it only makes sense that for him to come in this project because,0.02479206
really who is the helm this this long tail of of just mobsters and just,0.17640138
being through the perspective of these gentlemen through thick and thin and through almost every,0.036265813
single horrible moment here but obviously with a Scorsese film with the hype around it,0.114206046
and with the cast around it I mean it's a big film and it's a,0.056305137
film that it will take all of its criticisms and all of its indulging opinions,0.10623382
because it Scorsese can give it opinion just like all the rest of our movie,0.030295124
goers why not for his own film right which is fine for me because it's,0.04563426
not like in the sense that Scorsese is trying to redefine himself or anything even,0.038208812
though every film he establishes just what makes him stands out was such of a,0.028871631
character but you know there really is such a traditional filmmaking here that really goes,0.011818318
beyond a lot of the things that really kind of occupy when it comes to,0.017420495
the storytelling and really a lot of the foreshadowing that Scorsese is very obsessed with,0.024514012
you got a lot of the panning shots a lot of the visual images you,0.16841984
have so much of kind of these creative spaces that really kind of set the,0.020327346
environment and set the tone for a lot of the characters that Scorsese portrays a,0.008737853
narrative cinema that really Martin the captures upon just the setting of New York and,0.024969663
obviously with the way that everything captures from every street angle from every side angle,0.03791214
of people having a conversation inside of a club or having inside of a building,0.13779213
or through a car there's just so many translations through the weight of the camera,0.041946482
base its itself and bounces from character to character that it's almost as if you,0.030916406
know Martin is obsessed to make sure that you get every Satur perspective here especially,0.025194496
that the interesting part of the dialogue engage here is that if those were reformed,0.009844718
at all you know you look at characters that bounce off each other like one,0.06405585
will be the messenger to another and it's just always so intriguing because it builds,0.025945488
so much of the intensity because wow they try to flip you off of really,0.06330287
trying to base it off just at any moment knowing that anything can happen with,0.020066595
of course the dangers of the actions that are taking place here it's always from,0.02379894
the perspective of the characters and I think Martin is very not focused highly on,0.019380126
trying to make you have to choose who you need to like or not it's,0.031915512
more so that these are the characters these are their vulnerabilities and it's for you,0.021382993
to kind of take it to the chin of this is really the setting of,0.027059006
what it is and not even just talking from the background but even from the,0.036476675
sense of like the collar look and a lot of the things that very come,0.0237118
tight upon just how Martin wants everything aligned with each other there is so much,0.06835361
gristle to detail that is just something that for him it's just as a visionary,0.028085385
you have to capture things quickly in your head than almost even the writers do,0.091432154
and it's something that it all just occupies a lot behind the camera and there's,0.04230834
just so much here that grandpa did so is this three hour film that everything,0.058973853
just gets so much upon Martin's advantage from the budget to the way that this,0.024314458
film takes so much of its time yeah of course from behind the costume design,0.039509915
Christopher Peterson as well as sandy Power who did work for the favorite and Mary,0.044895906
Poppins returns and they do and glorious job here with the design here I mean,0.0212606
Lord talking from the pantsuits the dessous jackets to the highlighting of the clothing here,0.027266543
I mean everything is so non high-profile it's not too too flashy but it's just,0.03594054
nothing the crisp of making the characters just feel very real upon their presentation like,0.024617117
there are even moments that they play with the humor in this film of you,0.03776181
know a character walking in with a Gucci fit there's someone just coming in with,0.056185402
a suit that it's very transformative to an argument that it displays so well from,0.062452096
just the way that they can make everything speak in language that it's a tremendous,0.025523096
job here and also from going back to the score of Robbie Robertson's idea of,0.040560905
really the score here not being again to too traditional but there's ways that he,0.06022839
use a lot of the acoustic form and a lot of the trembling ways to,0.029065864
the score that really kind of sneaks up on that it builds this very crisp,0.04677904
tone that doesn't feel very overblown it doesn't put overdramatic for a film that is,0.040864225
a drama it really kind of sets home melodies here they are just very touching,0.054604262
upon the way that it just grabs so much of the moments that it doesn't,0.041484844
overpower a lot of other people in the room other voices it's like it just,0.0754611
hollows in as if like everything is moving in slow motion and it's just something,0.03530063
that is just really capturing it just really shows why the chemistry between him and,0.018094325
Martin is just so dynamic when they do films together now obviously with this being,0.04526841
a film this long and obviously needing your characters to carry the acting is obviously,0.02889092
the very big front center of this film here and with such including myself that,0.019090105
a duty years been critical for such a Robert in the not Pacino films like,0.032188237
this really kind of showed that man when they focus up it really kind of,0.037425227
shows for the better because while Robertson the order this might not be one of,0.048775923
my favorite performances from him and he's pretty solid in the film and Joe pesky,0.032244112
of course who is not as very animated as he usually is you know he's,0.060793128
someone that is very you know he's very constructive on his very humid and very,0.038932532
fast pace of speaking it's something he was really great and good fellows it's really,0.032138348
out Pacino that shines here and he shines in a way that is just an,0.02198698
advantage of of what he does so bets is that not only in the sense,0.035551406
of being eminent and animated but he just finds ways to take the situation and,0.023958584
a bunch of men in the room and he can extend one little piece of,0.089801125
dialogue and make it just feel just so brutal but just also makes it hit,0.08369607
in such a douchey way that it just gives the character so much to see,0.024891837
him as like a friend that you can probably relate to in real life of,0.0122313965
someone that you just cannot control it doesn't matter how much you advise this man,0.09633921
he is just so relentless and opportun I was so relentless in this film that,0.08336547
you're just like what are you doing it's so dangerous but it's so addicting and,0.10172853
it goes a lot of credit to even the way that he'll even cut himself,0.20103845
off like he wants to finish the sentence but he's so pissed that he can't,0.21523015
get it out and this was very performative to kind of the method of what,0.0667871
he does with his acting that it's really you know constructive here and it does,0.023360584
a lot to really kind of bring in the emotion of the scene even at,0.025331523
the aging factor of how we can get props so it's not as addictive as,0.048074152
you would fear to be meaning that it's too distracting dark moments that the center,0.093838125
part of where the camera angle is very close up that you can tell that,0.017573487
robber has this thing looked at how we kind of holds its form he's very,0.055699818
good at it it's what he's always been good at with the meat the films,0.10303229
I do think there are moments with his eye touches that they could have fixed,0.036815256
that a bit it's a bit too much as like a robot look but other,0.06983231
than that I do think for a moment for the most part they did a,0.02026216
really good job kind of capturing it obviously maybe not for makeup deform in a,0.034062725
sense maybe so but obviously well whatever they had to use to kind of make,0.023431094
that technology work I think over the plate in their favor and obviously this being,0.04661075
based on the book I heard you paint houses and weather patches of this could,0.011049366
be true or not because these films being as long as it is there's not,0.073553346
a lot that they could capture realistically and those debates about that for sure maybe,0.019155959
some reviews that you could be arguable or not in the sense of how realistic,0.057262335
that the kind of capture the film I think mostly Martin kind of focus again,0.030041024
on the detail of really kind of the delicacy of the emotions of seeing these,0.042044926
men and seeing how the bond kind of gets created and how decisions have to,0.06464055
get made whether you agree or disagree because a lot of the forward-thinking here goes,0.031028822
up on play of the way things get constructed or set up or the reasoning,0.034805734
of why certain moves have to get made you know there are so much upon,0.03727423
the blocks and a lot of the set pieces that really kind of play upon,0.045368187
the violence atmosphere as well but I think Martin kind of showed it from the,0.10445379
angle of what how he sees it that it happens so bluntly it happened so,0.02090406
quick it's not glorified it's not anything to be pretty it's just really brutal and,0.06373723
I think this film is a very you know very dark and very cold feel,0.03273768
to it that I think really kind of leaves it to stir and then you,0.054306924
can't think about it too long because then things are just moving forward because what,0.016809857
the themes here of films that Martin is done before the doesn't come very far,0.04505555
away from territory such as fighting a family of loyalty or respect there's a lot,0.05559339
of the grounds of what the gentlemen in this film here come upon front and,0.045873724
center of matter that people approach each other as men like the way people talk,0.07113806
to each other in this film they wanted front and center they do not want,0.042368207
to be in the background like even though it may seem egotistical at times I,0.11541335
think these characters understand that there's a lot more that bears upon what's to come,0.034759838
to lose that for them it's like if you're gonna address me address me and,0.09991191
that's what also comes with the character of a Frank where I think you see,0.012778178
it from his perspective because everything that comes upon a sense of none of this,0.054983415
lifestyle to be hydrolyzed is that the floatie of his character is the fact that,0.016967505
his own ego comes from whether he has the respect of someone else of migration,0.094714835
there's other people that you don't admire as well from their vulnerability of his constant,0.06594298
actions that I think really kind of tours apart kind of the subtleties of really,0.03648865
kind of his language speaking from his daughters to the way that residents for the,0.042262442
love of his wife that you see from the love of his brothers that it,0.061844785
comes so much impact to the way that people really want to sit and tell,0.034717266
you how these moments should have been like this but I think Martin kind of,0.03673144
understands that not everybody can kind of approach it the same family is not always,0.014157768
bright and smiley a lot of things come really not even in a sense of,0.08940401
bitterness and kind of you know distress it you know there are people that you,0.07455378
trust and there's just people that you know have a genuine feel to what they're,0.03156363
approaching you with yes that just kind of wanted like much into your life that,0.10929832
you don't really want that and I do like the idea of the way that,0.03754962
the kids and really kind of the daughters are viewed in this film bed it's,0.12038427
leveled in the sense that they're not in the background just to be in the,0.056839943
background they have human hearts too and sometimes they give that look that but sometimes,0.068973556
if directors can do it very lightly they just really show a way that really,0.020950625
it can kind of bring you in and are you just seeing these two people,0.047258638
facing each other and you can't turn away no matter how much Frank thinks that,0.035605285
he's owing this family and is giving them a lifestyle that they can avoid there's,0.031306867
nothing to avoid because they are a part of this this is something that they,0.032767612
have to live with and they can't just move like regular people or defend themselves,0.055431083
knowing that someone like this wants to be attached to everybody it's very threatening and,0.073514104
it's something that I think really kind of humanizes the characters in a way that,0.08823462
Martin really does very poetically even the comedy in this film the way that things,0.040008135
are depicted that really for something I find it you know hilarious I find it,0.031002214
in a dark sense you could look at the search of like the corner store,0.03602302
scene where Robert is coming in full like aggression mode or you look at even,0.046346005
the moment when of course the Jo scene involving ice cream they may feel improper,0.026868762
even the moment as well where we have guys discussing the smell of fish like,0.05586013
I don't know how a scene involving the mentioning of fish could be so hilarious,0.029819518
but it is if for me gripes with the film and it's not even really,0.018752193
involving the pace or even like the length of the film I think for me,0.03611149
it always comes from the grasp of moments where I think obviously this is a,0.021751504
very perspective film and there's a lot that you have to take in what some,0.038718343
times gonna be a bit too much and I do think it's understandable because that's,0.08901288
really for anyone to kind of interpret upon that with your interest of these characters,0.026360562
but I do think there's a lot more moments that while we settle with these,0.031090684
main main characters there's a lot other characters that I wish that could have got,0.009768887
a lot more shine that could have gave a real sense of like everybody being,0.06432525
part of the experience you know while you get these set of conversations I think,0.03203857
besides Frank given the comments or it would have been really nice to kind of,0.019113386
give others that sounded the perspective as well there's also moments where I do think,0.027966982
sometimes this film it definitely feels very big and I think for its own good,0.067071795
Wow it definitely has a lot to really kind of play with with obviously the,0.029145021
rector that's so great at what he does I do think there are moments I,0.12216164
kind of wish this film could really took its own time and in the sense,0.0312929
of that with it being so fast because it's around for film you already have,0.041256685
enough to spare upon your runtime and I wish it kind of took a lot,0.20441426
more moments to really kind of breathe in emotionally because sometimes it does kind of,0.04366332
feel like without the violent moments without a lot of the bitter and more very,0.045245793
more petty moments with a lot of the conversations that in dude I think you,0.06005278
motion 'le this phone could have definitely had its own moments to really kind of,0.021251287
spew in and not feel cliche because morons never really been about the cliche but,0.38568762
I think it would have been nice to kind of see the people that factored,0.12466074
in this life very heavily to kind of get their own moments as well because,0.040259574
I do think wow the Irishman does feel like a very big epic film and,0.059458107
really kind of showcases a lot of what makes Martin the best of what he,0.0387995
does with this genre I do think that our moments that it takes me out,0.043904115
because sometimes I do feel like the film is running too long in one perspective,0.020765038
that it just doesn't hit and resonate as much as visually what's captured because visually,0.029042583
there's a lot that really stands out upon the storytelling but I think verbally as,0.043562878
you kind of get used to it too much that it does kind of feel,0.08513287
like a parent that's kind of speaking to you repeatedly I also will say as,0.04119948
well that even though the ending the closing shot is great I definitely think it,0.27826518
kind of sinks in a lot of from the perspective of Frank I do think,0.0622113
that ending takes a bit too long upon reach it really stretches out for about,0.0789114
a 15 20 minute stretch and even though again I have no problem with the,0.0097682215
runtime I do think kind of the pace is where for me it kind of,0.029379167
really kind of triggers but I think overall the irishman is still enjoyable it may,0.182706
not be one of my favorites from Scorsese but I do think it is an,0.034600858
experience especially for a Netflix film it offers a lot the performances are pretty solid,0.014852885
but I definitely think Al Pacino was a huge standout here also wouldn't give a,0.021908488
shot at the Bobby Cannavale and of course there's a Clements who appear in here,0.34811786
it was great to see them and also special appearance from that rapper that was,0.035023913
great overall the Irishman is on Netflix it's three hours and 20-some minutes I would,0.06766115
say give it a shot if you're a movie goer because it's more on Scorsese,0.21714655
alone and whether you like it or not I still respect the fact that he's,0.061977822
one of the bolder filmmakers we still have and for a man that is that,0.027903123
the pace of where he's at in life he is truly making the films he,0.062648326
wants to make and I give that credit to him at Quentin Tarantino that they,0.019741986
are truly showing that they can go by their own pace and that's something you,0.032375153
have to respect and I I definitely respect them for that direction here I'm still,0.023860803
good for them uh yeah I'm out of breath whoo writing something but the montre,0.14418587
tomato saying the Irishman for me gives basic seven to the Irishman what were your,0.08479961
