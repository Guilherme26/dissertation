today's a rare day,0.11577253
when you can celebrate a movie's 100th anniversary because the cabinet of dr.,0.037703544
Caligari was released exactly a hundred years ago today not only that but from a certain point of view,0.06634955
you can also say the entire horror film genre also turns a hundred today sure there existed many older films that could be considered horror,0.09502935
mostly short films including many by Georges méliès who was the Godfather of special-effects and introducing fantasy elements to motion pictures and Thomas Edison produced a Frankenstein film in 1910 there also existed many adaptations of Jekyll and Hyde back then but Caligari was the first where all the elements that we know in horror films came together,0.064951465
it's strange that the old VHS tapes always said the movie came out in 1919 and that seemed to be the common accepted date for a while but now it seems that's been corrected,0.10317044
it was filmed in late 1919 but premiered in Germany on February 26th 1920 so we didn't miss it,0.07483283
it's one of my favorite silent films,0.09238157
and the reason why is because of its visual style that uses elements of German Expressionism an art movement,0.12882973
in the early 20th century where the artist would distort reality to emphasize their subjective view and emotions as soon as we enter,0.050466776
its world,0.05016951
we see a painted landscape of a town on a hill where all the rooftops are leaning like grass being blown in the wind the town streets have angular splashes of light beneath the warped gas lamps alleyways slán and disappear into darkness,0.11770026
the interiors of homes have painted shadows creating odd shapes light and shadow are always painted on the walls things bend at weird angles windows are anything but square sometimes they seem to explicitly point at something to draw your focus to the most important part of the frame contrasting stripes of light and shadow extend from its central points the characters themselves,0.03294529
even act like they belong to this twisted environment,0.26835996
look at how he moved,0.065333456
so unnaturally guiding himself along the weird scenery and then as he extends his arms mimicking the tree branches and when you sit down long enough and just give yourself to this movie it puts you in a trance like you're going into a dream world films were invented as a visual medium but until then most filmmakers would just film the real world,0.15457433
but then thanks to movies like Caligari,0.051608745
they were utilizing film to show us a fantasy world and escape from reality,0.10964992
it's also an early example of a framing story because it begins with our main character francis sitting on a bench with another man about to tell him a story,0.08430172
you know kind of like Forrest Gump,0.104255095
and that story he tells is the main movie here Francis recalls hanging out with his friend Alan and their mutual friend Jane who they're competing for romantically but without drama they go to a carnival where they see an act by a magician named Calgary who opens a coffin shaped box to reveal a sleepwalker named Caesar or Sasori,0.10145722
I'll just say c-czar,0.095165424
I guess because it's a little shorter,0.060475938
these are answers questions from the audience,0.06506635
Alan asks how long he has to live and sees or tells him he won't even make it to dawn and it just,0.09591168
so happens that very night someone comes into his bedroom and stabs him to death even though they only imply the stabbing with a shadow,0.55775875
it's still a pretty gruesome idea for 1920,0.3959263
this predates the famous psycho shower scene stabbing by for decades and since this movie has a body count,0.46440044
you can call it,0.09976161
a proto slasher film in the morning Francis,0.09210917
and Jane are horrified suspecting Caesar,0.06035592
they go the police who begin an investigation the police end up arresting,0.1925322
a random man who is caught trying to murder someone but is unrelated to the person who murdered,0.53490317
Alan Jane visits Caligari alone he invites her to take a close look at c-czar she gets frightened and runs off and he seems to take joy in it,0.13823251
and now it also seems she's been marked for murder Francis snoops about peering through a window keeping a watchful eye on Caligari and see SAR while they sleep but somehow CSR is in two places at once as he emerges outside Jane's win,0.15168178
what a creepy shot I love how he pulls the window off and then slowly creeps into the room there's something real fascinating seeing that dark slim body moving so slowly toward her bed very deliberate,0.46345222
and theatrical,0.057784893
he raises the knife to kill,0.67748433
her,0.07769221
but when he looks at her again up close he hesitates as if he has some kind of feelings for her,0.10703931
he lowers the knife he goes to touch her,0.5825581
but then she wakes up screams and then he grabs her and this right here is probably the most disturbing shot of the whole movie he carries her off up onto misshapen rooftops and across crooked bridges as an angry mob chases after him until he seems to come out of his spell collapses and dies the police search Caligari again and find the Caesar who's been sleeping in the box as of lately he's just a dummy Caligari runs away,0.4658348
and Frances follows him all the way to an insane asylum he walks in and asked to see the director of the asylum only to find the director his Caligari while he sleeps,0.4023536
he investigates the director's office with the cooperation of the asylum staff,0.1543365
they find the director's journals and when they read them it goes into a flashback,0.092743054
and since the whole movie is a flashback,0.12896901
it's technically a flashback within a flashback which is pretty crazy,0.44241828
for early silent cinema,0.060526907
here,0.053441156
we learn the director was obsessed with an ancient mystic named Caligari who used a sleepwalker to commit murders,0.44690982
so he experiments on his own sleepwalker,0.38404527
after the flashback ends the police come to the director's office bringing him Caesars corpse,0.2970662
he lashes out at them,0.24132551
they restrained him in a straitjacket and lock him up in his own asylum,0.5659879
then we come out of the main flashback and we're back to Francis on the bench like we saw in the beginning,0.07597435
and I will say spoiler alert but you may have already seen it coming,0.056301784
and the movie is a century old but it turns out now all along,0.089310765
the bench is located at that very same Asylum,0.11204318
and Francis himself is a patient inside,0.0921682
we see a group of characters who are each suffering from different delusions and all them resemble characters from Francis's story the director walks in who now only resembles Caligari but is not explicitly the same guy francis flips out screaming that he's Caligari and it seems,0.09763461
now that francis was completely insane all along they put him in the straitjacket and lock him in the exact same cell from his story then the director says he now understands his delusion and knows how to cure him but right before the iris closes on his face it lingers,0.439384
why does it linger is he Caligari or is he not that's the question it leaves you with a plot twist like,0.077094756
this must have been a pretty big deal back in 1920 you don't often see movies in the silent era that have something this complex,0.07343559
and the fact the character telling the story is a patient in an asylum,0.15357172
it makes you question whether anything you saw was real,0.09555389
it's a completely subjective movie that adheres to no set facts you make up whatever you want,0.06782201
and that's of course why the visuals are so surreal,0.09048069
it's meant to be the world of a madman and that visual world has become the look of gothic horror films I mean early in the sound era with Frankenstein 1931 you can see all the traces of Caligari on full display the shadowy staircase the slanted walls the oddly shaped windows,0.28355145
the bedroom scene where the monster sneaks in through the window to attack Frankenstein's wife it's all there,0.37508276
it's also apparent in murders of the Rue Morgue from 1932,0.20934115
we can see all the buildings and rooftops are slanted at strange angles,0.06477001
it's very common,0.07852333
now that type of architecture has almost become standard in a whole genre of films mainly the world of Tim Burton it seems almost everything,0.07619462
Tim Burton has ever made is in some way inspired by Caligari also the classic theme of Beauty,0.10619353
and the Beast is there the monster falls in love with a girl and carries her off to the rooftops we see that happen and murders in the Rue Morgue,0.54930425
but this time it's an ape carrying her up the roof and then only a year after that in 1933 we have an even bigger ape carrying the girl up onto an even bigger building,0.44512454
yes,0.036876976
I just drew links from Caligari tumours the Rue Morgue to King Kong but you know that's only the beginning because then we trace it to Creature from the Black Lagoon and from that point it's so common,0.19560562
it doesn't even matter,0.116249464
it's the classic cliche,0.07666501
it's the monster falls in love with the girl and that becomes his downfall it's Beauty and the Beast,0.56929237
it's even older than Caligari then there's the theme of the mad doctor or villain taking control of a monster,0.35776684
it's been recycled countless times throughout horror movies even the common idea is there of just being a main villain who's the mastermind and then the obedient henchman who carries out his plans it's the brain,0.2982204
and the brawn it's the standard superhero cliche and the idea of an evil hypnotist or someone who controls or persuades the thoughts of common people is opening a whole can of worms the film was made,0.2242236
in Germany between World War 1 and World War 2 and its political aspects have been analyzed and discussed in detail Caligari is the representation of the authority or dictator and caesar is the brainwashed person who's forced into following a tyrant and on that note I want to direct your attention to one scene one tiny little detail right before Allan a staff there's a brief shot of his hands,0.41715986
it's a very weird edit because it flashes by so quick and doesn't really match,0.07891169
the continuity of the other shots for some reason that shot always lingered in my mind,0.27185416
and I wonder I just wonder if in 1928 the political artist John Hartfield saw and remembered that image when he designed the poster called five fingers has the hand which was meant to oppose the Nazi Party then in 1998 System of a Down used it for their cover of their debut album I just make a link from Caligari to System of a Down possibly since this movie is so old and everyone in it is long dead,0.18540803
we may never know all the details of what it meant,0.09078493
and how it was made,0.05849897
I find that adds to the appeal that with silent movies like this,0.06743918
there is a little sense of mystery that goes along with its antiquity personally,0.09211828
I'm so fascinated with those sets,0.087238275
I've always wondered is there any possible way a single piece of any of them has survived probably not,0.07153844
and when a movie almost has no tangible evidence other than the film itself it kind of becomes unreal in a way like it truly exists in a dream it's most notable actor conrad veidt had been the star of the man who laughs which was the inspiration for the Joker,0.1298683
he had a career which lasted into the sound era,0.084774636
he was in the sound version of The Thief of Bagdad playing the main villain jaffer when the story was adapted into the Disney animated film Jaffer became Jafar,0.16276224
so if having been the basis of a famous comic book villain and a Disney villain wasn't enough he was also the villain in Casablanca which just might be the most critically acclaimed film of all time,0.135021
if you haven't seen Caligari now's a better time than ever because nowadays you can see it in high-def clarity when I first saw it in the early 90s,0.033188246
it was on a crappy VHS tape that was when the film was in the public domain for a while and any low-rent distributor could release it the copies always looked fuzzy,0.35045183
I couldn't tell what was going on with the set design looking back that kind of made it more interesting,0.05514282
because as the movie kept getting re-released it kept looking better and better so it was like being able to see more,0.036371782
and more of the movie as time,0.07907877
went on silent films are interesting,0.08928289
because back then when they transfer them to video they didn't always project them at the proper speed,0.083143964
so the characters moved very rapidly,0.064222954
and the movie flew by at only 50 minutes,0.079185
I think at the proper speed Caligari is like one hour 20 minutes,0.10858879
but that used to confuse me,0.106432736
I always wondered why is the movie so much longer are there scenes that were restored,0.042160027
but no it's just a different speed and by watching it slower,0.040856626
it definitely gives a different feel you could say it drags a little at the longer speed or that it helps put you into that hypnotic mood,0.05273462
the title cards are different to the versions,0.05658861
I saw was in English texts real plain and simple but the newest releases have restored the original German titles which were written in an expressionist style which is real cool,0.09885757
but of course if you only know English then you're reading subtitles over the titles also depending which version you see you could hear a different sound track because with silent movies,0.058499347
there's obviously no sound so all those different VHS releases would use whatever stock music,0.15420492
they had now with official blu-ray releases they tend to go back to the original sheet music and recreate what the orchestra would play in the old theater palaces,0.10694536
so depending on the music you hear or what speed it's projected,0.07287291
I mean they could totally change your impression of the film and it really depends on your mindset what type of mood,0.09174535
you're in when you watch it,0.14492072
I say put it on at night at some dark quiet hour and just drift off into the surreal world of the cabinet of dr.,0.13315642
Caligari,0.030955054
you,0.10154687
