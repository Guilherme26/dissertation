yeah hey what's going on out of the YouTube,0.18887748
this is SCO 0 pick to 0 representing JVs so this is gonna be my review for a movie that I've been long overdue of watching and I'm talking about the movie Lady Bird coming-of-age story,0.116825536
this was directed by Greta gierek starring I'm gonna get her name so wrong I apologize but sorry so Ross Ronan Laurie Metcalf um Lucas hedges and Timothy Shaw met the ironic thing about all four do you feel that just listed either last year or this year they're not made for Academy Award,0.08167321
Timothy are Sarma is nominated for the movie with Armie Hammer,0.11074194
even though he was in this movie Lucas hedges for Manchester by to see who did amazing in that and then you got Laurie and this is Ronan that are nominated for Lady Bird,0.11422013
and I gotta say their relationship is so real like what I mean by that is the organic nosov how they function and thrive as a mother and a daughter is something that I can sit there and be like I've seen this before this seems real it's not like okay,0.11078759
we're gonna like have this,0.0681873
Hollywood moment where this thing happens or like okay,0.097469606
this person is gonna get this epiphany and they change like I think one of the most literal amazing scenes is when Lady Bird and her mom are legit going and trying on dresses and Lady Bird goes trial on his pink dress,0.34924254
she likes it and her mom,0.40324605
the first thing because our mom is like something kind of sitting like is it too pink and Lady Prairie responds back why can't you just be okay with it,0.18661043
why can't you just like me,0.1764682
and then she goes back and even reiterates with it's like why don't you like me,0.31089434
and I mean I think that the movie Fitz's hit home with me son kind of the same way as this one because this is for me was something that I'm I come from the south I come from you know certain circumstances where I'm like man,0.15227264
I this is real,0.053600397
these kind of conversations are seemingly real even though it's coming from a play like,0.07060101
I can see and relate to this conversation,0.03995773
and even with these two people these two amazing actresses they're able to convey something to me that I was like mate because one of the things that Laurie the mom says early on and move on,0.093440525
I've know I'm kind of spoiling a little bit I apologize,0.29633
you should definitely go,0.13288781
check this movie out but I think that even if you see it in the trailers,0.061173458
I don't think you're gonna lose anything as far as weight behind,0.30605397
it um,0.07055757
one of the things that she talks to her about when Lady Bird gets upset with her is that she was my lady pros like you know,0.27610022
haven't you ever just wanted to do this,0.14469774
and do this as a kid like and not complaining about this,0.17801368
and like she was like my mom was an abuser and an alcoholic and it was like yo like and that that defines her character if you don't catch this little moment everything up she does you won't pick up on you won't pick up that cheese very much so a perfectionist like analytical critical highly over-critical can't even really enjoy herself because she not just critical of you know labor but of herself and what she does and ironic thing is that she interacts with people and helps people throughout their problems like literally that's what she does you know saying I'm just a nurse but she really helps people without their problems,0.15613852
but yet she does that to try to project because she's got this internal turmoil within herself and and even like later on her dad even says to the baby bird like look your mom loves you,0.34098333
but your mom,0.48590624
can't even get out from this one specific situation to try to help,0.07329389
she doesn't know how to help you net that hurts her on the inside and I was like that's crazy,0.5155984
but then the character Lady Bird is even more conflicting because she's not good at anything,0.25043792
it's like he's not just like you know how I got these like superstar characters you know like alright,0.11931209
this person is gonna have this one trait,0.3418733
it's good Act,0.055058956
she's gonna be good at writing but she's gonna be good at you know organizational skills,0.3471609
so you gonna have the same as that Kings and her mom have she any of those things,0.20093329
and what happens is because her mom is not able to reflect and let her know like you are great,0.42200938
I like you everything's good,0.14901127
so she she touched her dad,0.3632055
but you know it's always that mother-daughter thing that shows like where you are going as a woman and so for her she's a pathological liar because she has to try to appease to feel at place and that sounds crazy,0.77872676
but her friend I was her friend's name oh my gosh Julie paid by a beanie Feldstein I would have actually liked a little bit more of her but I like the way they just kind of like ran it off,0.28008047
they didn't give me too much,0.08846095
because that's not about,0.07364512
you know the story has over art either way when her and Julie were conversating and stuff like that like it was like it seems so organic it seemed so natural but eventually she just decides the desert Julie and I go and meet up with this cool girl because she wants to hang out with this cool guy,0.14861856
and then it's like expectation expectation and it's not even like peer pressure,0.08773066
it's like you need to feel like you're at place,0.152988
and part of that is because it reflects on who she sees in herself like even when she goes and like goes into the the teachers location takes the grades those enjoy sound like like this is who I am and it's like yo like she has no characteristics about her that makes her exceptional other than the fact that she is a realist when it comes down to it like an eventual point she's like alright yeah,0.14020218
I was a pathological liar like look,0.8148001
this is this where it is but she's really just figuring out that's why I mix it,0.15494342
so well done as a story,0.054534957
that's a coming-of-age story,0.071472235
my legit like when I got done looking at the movie those one moment towards the end where Julie's mom like shuts her out,0.2623961
you know I'm saying and like Julie leaves,0.108429976
I'm not Julie,0.071843214
but um Lady Bird leaves and she goes a circle in the car right and like that performance was oh lazy because she conveyed so many emotions and she kept it in,0.3459731
and I was this like because we have seen like the parallel between the beginning of the stories like them two together in the car and you know their their body hit these proximate because they're already clashing but you know they love each other but he can't really talk about it,0.0942373
and like the beginning you don't say lady breathless I'm crazy,0.46118852
I don't wanna spoil it,0.17631695
but when the mom is by her stuff and leaving she's like in her heart,0.154694
I can feel like there goes,0.05916646
my best friend daily goes my daughter,0.17413957
there goes the person I need to protect and I can't help you know I'm saying like I was I feel uneasy,0.1310222
motion,0.040987045
Dan later bird later on she goes to this church when she gets through what she needs to be and she leaves it has this conversation,0.14402424
it's like like I'm feeling all these kind of things,0.15442927
I'm like yo I'm sitting there I go back and recount to myself and that news is telling a little bit about myself,0.12492382
I don't want I normally don't do this,0.095900655
but this movie provokes testimony in my personal opinion,0.11145626
because you know saying when I think about high school like when I went to prom for my high school,0.1406139
I didn't go with anybody,0.15089989
I got you know invited was somebody I didn't want to go with,0.05344553
and then you know I went,0.055410538
but I met up with the person that I wanted to dance with,0.06878207
but we didn't leave together a legit left my prom and I went to the waterfront and just you know children listened to music because my family situation it wasn't so much about like when I went to prom like alright well it's gonna be this you're gonna have this little did I it was it was a totally different family dynamic,0.066147774
so for me to go out and go to the water park what would a front and be in my car and listen to music chillin like I was like I embraced that,0.0764647
so I said they're almost like I'm connected to this moment with Julie and Lady Bird,0.20380796
I was like me,0.08442308
and I love this like when you know Lady Bird is have this conversation with her mom back and forth like I can relate to these kind of conversations because this is real this is like even like when she went and go away to college like when I went to college you know I'm saying,0.253116
and I was kind of just like taken back,0.052230574
when she had this conversation I was talking to her dad over the phone talking about like she's rich,0.14567026
I talked to her mom and she's talking about like her hometown and how long she drove in it for the first time it was different than when she walked around they don't when her mom drove away it was like she they were to set and feel all the beauty,0.16079642
and she couldn't really accept,0.14538449
all of it until later on and I'm getting to a point here but for me like I remember going to college and like you know I was like man,0.11496505
there are some beautiful things in my small town that I'll miss you know saying,0.07855537
I didn't accept it until much later you know saying even now like I'm not you know,0.0768532
it's different like it was moments like I always remember,0.063550815
and they they take part of who I am because one of the biggest critical things about the the movie to me was that Lady Bird tried to say I need to get away from home,0.18839246
you know I want to be this,0.11676002
I want to be better than this person,0.4358872
I want to be the center of attention,0.053248264
but she had no idea you know who she really is she wasn't good at anything,0.24900645
and on top of that like she alienated,0.16776691
everybody because of her pathological lying you know about everything you know I'm saying like it was like she had her friend Julie,0.43037936
and she shut her out,0.6370489
you know,0.07163658
she had other friends,0.06447853
but they weren't really friends there was even a moment where yo oh boy Lukas huge Lukas hedges has interesting relationship with her that whole relationship would bit off of a line foundation you know,0.14020717
and then like the crazy thing,0.27212766
I'll say that I think that her mom in her do have in common I think is an asset which is actually something good about Lady Bird that she probably gets from her mom is that after the fact of being able to forgive I think that forgiveness is something that Lady Bird can definitely be able to do as much as she bickered and you know act,0.21497117
it out did all these kind of things like the relationship between Danny,0.11821887
and Lady Bird is to me a testament of her able to forgive her being able to late because the any situation,0.12708716
that's real you don't say like you never would know you know,0.20796192
but it happened,0.046043277
and when he broke down on her,0.30050057
I was like oh that's crazy you know and it just it feels real and for me to be able to rant about this,0.2915501
it's almost like you know,0.10716563
I took a I took a I took a detour into Sacramento California chilled and just kind of like went with a camera crew and just walked around with like these characters for a while and just watch their lives like the jimin in the 2005 the music,0.07734775
selections like the the dress the way people dressed and the way things were and even like from a Catholic school standpoint,0.11614392
I mean I don't wanna go too much into that but it's very much so accurate in my personal opinion,0.13569745
so as a film and that was able to convey how they act,0.08213097
I can see why this was definitely rated one of the highest movies this year,0.055259623
this gave me the same as X feeling that me myself me me Earl and the dying girl gave me emotionally as much as a coming-of-age story that you know,0.280368
I think it's just this is an interesting Testament it's like it was to me it was definitely better than manhood because her boyhood because it felt so organically real not just from the standpoint of time,0.38468784
but from what things were happening,0.06109358
so I mean I don't know what to give this a rating,0.14940034
I don't want to just give it,0.09753941
a 10 just to say us a 10 but it can't be anything long,0.086620316
it is I'm gonna give it a range how about that nine to ten a nine to attend is where this was stand,0.09798654
I don't know I feel like over time,0.107246704
if I said yeah I looked at this on my wife she would love it we would probably bring it up to a ten if I looked at this over time of myself like a foggy night for five where my Steven at nine but as a movie it is very good,0.21815273
it is very well acted is very organic,0.08911475
it's very natural,0.10159117
and I think it's very interesting that I would wait tonight which is the night the sudden fit Daniel in lobes to watch this film because for sure man the mom could easily get nominated for me,0.134317
and as well as oh girl Ronan she could get nominated as well or not nominee,0.31089434
they could both win but either way I hope y'all enjoyed this review keep the lock jbi swingin on stop ladybird is a good time definitely go check it out these guys,0.3561082
