the movie I'm reviewing is the Irishman,0.09155977
it's actually now on Netflix DVD and streaming,0.15312977
I don't normally review movies once they're on Netflix already,0.08199779
but this one is such a feature film quality and of epic proportion but I couldn't dismiss it it's actually rated R it's 3 hours and 29 minutes long and the movie review mom grade that I'm gonna give it is an A / a - and I'll tell,0.066667974

for parents and then tell you the things that I liked and,0.03153609
didn't like so first in a quick nutshell if you love Italians and all things mob-related you're really gonna enjoy this drama based on the events surrounding Jimmy,0.1895954
Hoffa's death,0.33117795
now if you're probably under 30 years old maybe even 40 you'll say who's Jimmy Hoffa in which case you can watch this movie and learn a thing or two,0.094630815
it's directed by award-winning Martin Scorsese the movie features a master class in acting no doubt by the legendary Robert De Niro and Al Pacino and that's really why you want to see this movie,0.07577523
they're both incredible as expected it's based on the book called I heard you paint houses which I thought would also be a really good name for a title but it's called the Irishman which is actually a really good title as well at by the time you finish watching the movie you're gonna go,0.052973095
yeah,0.040847696
that was a good title,0.054669324
cinephiles are going to be analyzing this film for decades as classic Scorsese art,0.24736162
it's no question that,0.06768048
we'll see some Oscar nominations for best acting best director all that kind of stuff,0.053946134
now some quick tips for parents kids are not going to be interested in this movie,0.11048592
nor should,0.05460826
they watch it,0.07202375
it's rated R people get shot to death with blood splatters blood pools of blood lots of violence,0.64939195
lots of shooting lots of beating up that kind of stuff,0.63408124
you see a bunch of cow parts hanging in a truck,0.6364068
you know it's a meat truck a man beats up another man and breaks his hands in front of a little girl,0.40328303
there's tons of profanity crude language and a bazillion f-bombs like exhausting number you see topless men in a sauna you know they're just sitting in a sauna,0.4298289
and then some racial slurs some themes are dishonesty pride loyalty power and control,0.30233723
now some things that I really like is our first of all I mentioned the actors the two leading men the cast was really great and includes four Oscar winners Robert DeNiro Al Pacino Joe Pesci and Anna Paquin I really like Anna and I was expecting to see more of her she I think has one line in the entire movie and she mostly just kind of looks and stares so that seemed like a waste of talent for her but anyway it was still nice to see her in the movie and the other three that I just mentioned phenomenal and I hadn't seen Joe Pesci in anything in quite a while so I just loved to seeing him other standouts are Bobby Cannavale E Steven Van Sant Harvey Keitel Ray Romano Jesse Plemons and a million more Italians in Hollywood rumor has it that Joe Pesci actually refused this role more than 50 times because he didn't want to come out of retirement,0.1267189
but I'm so glad he did he is just outstanding,0.08363489
I already said that Ray Liotta however is missing in the movie I don't know if he got an invitation or not,0.10251835
but he should have been I really liked him and he would have been perfect in this movie it was also really fascinating to learn about some of the real-life people and how everything was connected and how things might have gone down of course,0.2049894
we still don't know the facts of everything,0.098583095
so it was just an interesting perspective and it could have easily happened this way,0.039832234
I'm always in summary,0.07944265
impressed with the technology that makes actors look younger,0.0525856
so the special effects were just amazing,0.06468335
they were provided by Industrial Light and Magic and that was half the fun was watching some of these older actors go back in time they're actually Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro actually speak Italian in the movie with no subtitles or at least than the one that I saw there were no subtitles they talked about the war and then they quickly transition to English,0.11066511
but the Italian sounded pretty good and gave a really nice authentic flare,0.10036786
I thought it was super interesting to read on the screen how various people in the Mafia were found dead not at the very end of the movie although there's a little bit of that,0.24031298
but during the movie as new characters are introduced it'll say on the screen found shot dead 14 times in the head or the heart or whatever and I was just like whoa,0.24005072
so that was kind of a really interesting and actually kind of a cool element that I really liked it the music was perfect set the tone although there was one song that they played over and over again whatever now some things that I didn't like,0.055683076
and this list is very short first of all the movie is really really long too long,0.107860275
I think some things could have easily been cut out some people say oh not a minute was wasted it was perfection,0.19019926
and actually there was some talk that they were going to turn this into a two-part series which I think would have been good or better for the average viewer,0.07602527
it's just really really long,0.058796953
this is actually the longest film ever directed by Martin Scorsese and the longest feature film released in over 20 years it took 106 days to film also the longest shooting of Scorsese Scorsese's career and so another item was that there's some jumping back back and forth quite a bit from past a present that might confuse viewers,0.06372786
and then the only other pro are the only other thing that I didn't care for was just so much profanity for me it's just exhausting to sit through all of that I want to see the art,0.11117833
and of course it represents how they they would have spoken back then but it's just exhausting anyway that's it,0.06904249
I thought it was really really,0.052552536
