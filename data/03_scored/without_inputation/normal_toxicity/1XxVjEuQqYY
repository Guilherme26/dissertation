so I had never seen double indemnity probably because there was the released a year before,0.110219695
my mother was born but um when I got into it I really enjoyed it like it was a little slow at times and you know the it's a very old fashioned in some places even just from the clothes like the guy wears,0.21463221
the Fred MacMurray is the shirin salesman a Barbara Stanwyck is the wife that convinces him to kill her husband and you know he his his uh waste the of his pants are up to his nipples just about and you know he talks to you and I hold that old film talked you know baby,0.8090152
yeah I want to do this like it's definitely the product of its time,0.0693647
but it's interesting because the actual tone of the film is incredibly dark,0.080291994
I mean the story is about a guy murdering someone and then trying to cover it up it's incredibly dark at the same time like it's not dark like a movie today would be because it like even though things are happening or really I mean he's kind of evil the main character,0.40336406
but like you as you're meant to like him,0.1332176
and it's only that's some though so on about it because like he's talking all y'all that old speak and this at the same time,0.17536631
he's doing horrible things,0.51110667
and I it's an interesting the economy in the film,0.07791152
and while I don't think a movie like this could be made today with such a dark tone,0.24081948
at the same time,0.057851598
there is no really graphic violence shown on screen,0.15008658
I mean there are murderers,0.40320063
and people are shot and stuff goes down but they don't really show it like this kind of happens like off-screen or like you see late yeah you know that don't show it all the same time,0.13047104
similarly,0.050954916
they don't have any sex like the guys murdering people for this girl,0.7093121
you don't even have sex with her like because as you know,0.8785311
I think you know they had limitations back then with what they could show,0.047916327
but the same time they the tone could be really dark and it's interesting the same time like the sexiest part is when the UH the Fred MacMurray kind of gets entranced by her ankles,0.15153816
oh there's some sexy ankles you wanna murder your husband I'm down just don't cover up them ankles,0.87601614
one thing,0.067855746
I didn't like though is that because you know has that whole that film noir trope I guess I may not be the trope of the time of the person narrating the movie,0.12589581
and the you know at the beginning basically,0.050461974
he's telling the he's recorded making a recording of everything they did,0.07447032
so he kind of know from we bright from beginning that,0.053413607
he did murder the girl's husband and like I would have that there's a moment in the movie where he acts like you kidding,0.53490317
I'm not gonna do that kid she starts to hint at something when she's when he's trying to sell her insurance and she's trying to hint at maybe buying some accident insurance for him and what that may entail and you know he responds like a person should respond,0.15067287
but then he goes back and like I almost like if I knew he had to go back like it was like the more if I didn't know that I think you know,0.077601016
and I kind of enjoyed the narration you know it worked,0.059806738
well with the film and fit in nicely as in general I don't like when essentially movie Constable's itself so overall,0.07603876
I really enjoyed,0.033999007
the Double Indemnity like I would recommend that if you're looking for a classic film noir to look to watch and that's something that's really different from movies we see in nowadays,0.089009844
and I it's really interesting,0.0578621
if I give it like a seven point seven five out of ten there's some like that's well thanks for watching you,0.0747728
