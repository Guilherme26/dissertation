I'm off the deeper watches at 7:00,0.06563151
I'll never meet the bro hello,0.12104237
everybody my name is Steph Koza and today I'm gonna review a star is born,0.06286254
I have so many feelings,0.060511746
so many feelings everywhere ah so a star is born is directed by Bradley Cooper,0.053717446
it is his directorial debut very exciting,0.1077918
but also very scary you never really know what you're gonna get when an actor decides to make a movie it's like it could be really good or it could just be the worst thing,0.19245885
that's ever happened also Lady Gaga's,0.105506845
first big movie role which is super exciting,0.11375573
because I love Lady Gaga,0.06887968
I love her more than most people I love her so much I love her voice I love her spirit,0.06145612
I love literally everything about her,0.11222905
I'm also a huge fan of Bradley Cooper,0.08587718
I just like I don't know,0.107763425
I never it's like the duo,0.100576326
I never thought I needed,0.08646714
and now I can't name a more iconic duo,0.07266337
they're just incredible together,0.04722576
so this movie is actually a remake of a remake,0.1267213
there's the 1954 version starring Judy Garland and James Mason and then there's the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson they all follow pretty much the same bones of the story which is there's this character Jack played by Bradley Cooper who is kind of a has-been rock star,0.08083743
he's been doing it almost his whole life,0.14088607
he's very used to it,0.0815841
he's very used to the lifestyle of being a rock star and drinking and being an alcoholic and a drug addict and just kind of floating through life like that but he is a really skilled musician and a really passionate musician and he really loves what he does,0.53490317
and then you have Lady Gaga's character Ally who is a struggling artist,0.26471367
she's always wanted to be a singer,0.10044818
but is like basically just about giving up on that dream and one day that starts a line and they meet and Bradley Cooper is like you're amazing,0.058731906
I want to make you famous also I'm in love with you,0.19413488
so there you go kind of a tragic love story about music and passion and following your dreams and it's just got all the stuff that makes you feel things,0.1522871
and I loved every second of it so much,0.14734013
I think the chemistry between Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper is astounding they are so beautiful together,0.242401
they're so good at being in love like you just believe it,0.111046
I was something going on behind the scenes here like hello,0.08594368
they just have this very very strong passionate pure love that even when they're fighting and they're arguing they still love each other at the end and it's just so beautiful also the music in this movie like that alone blew me away,0.13063629
I knew ever since I saw the trailer and I heard Lady Gaga's voice and I was like ah I love her but it's just so good so beautiful,0.08499698
so well written everything,0.06967848
every song,0.08701915
I was like tearing up it was it was an emotional ride for me this movie shows like two sides of being famous and it shows them really well like we have Jack's character who has already been doing this for a really long time,0.06488001
he's like pretty much been raised like this,0.1923956
he didn't have a great childhood,0.10964493
he's just like this is my life,0.13371171
I'm a rock star I party I drink,0.060574565
I do drugs everyday and that he's just very used to it,0.42524633
and he's very stuck,0.17851275
in this kind of rut of just not being fulfilled with life,0.17699808
and we just kind of watch him deteriorate throughout the movie and alternatively we see Lady Gaga's character ally like slowly rise to the top actually very quickly rise to the top and with her character,0.058061283
we see the other side of Fame or it's someone who has had nothing their whole life and they've always dreamed of it but they're like there's just no way that would never happen to me and then it does and it's so fast,0.15388945
and she becomes this other person,0.15160619
that's not really her,0.117907956
and it's very very strongly similar to Lady Gaga's actual life like a lot of things that happen in this movie happened to Lady gaga,0.24101867
and I was like wow I'm watching Lady Gaga's life right now not Ali this is gaga,0.31073487
I'm sure it wasn't exactly like that,0.08436427
but it was very similar to her life story and very similar to what happened to her and how the industry kind of shaped her into this personality and made her into this weird pop star and almost took away her original talent,0.20796624
and this movie comments about that a lot and it's very interesting and very scarily true because this is the thing that actually does happen in the world I would not be surprised if this movie got some Oscar nominations definitely for the music probably for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's performances because they were both so amazing,0.06080196
I think even though this is Cooper's directorial debut and Lady Gaga's first big role you would never guess it like do you look like they've been doing this for their whole lives,0.14983259
this is two incredible forces of acting and directing and music at work and their chemistry on the screen is so good uh I think this movie is a beautiful tribute to artists and to dreamers and to love and love stories,0.034142446
it's just God,0.060398746
I don't know I just really enjoyed this movie I think everything that it does it does really,0.096187346
well there was nothing I just liked about it,0.07350952
I thought it was a very long movie it's nearly two and a half hours which is pretty long,0.08325614
I didn't really realize how long it was,0.056203734
I think there were definitely some parts that were a little bit slow,0.3107971
but I don't know it's kind of a slow burn and it didn't really bother me,0.16019975
I really didn't realize how long,0.07862633
it was until it was over and it's like wow I was really long but it I liked it I liked it so much it doesn't even faze me plot was great,0.13623968
the acting was great the music was great nothing about this movie was bad in my opinion,0.24052013
I think it was great,0.084982716
I think everyone should go see it,0.08132067
if you like movies it's a good movie I'm gonna give it a five out of five there you go,0.13914417
but that's it for my review of a star is born,0.06438056
