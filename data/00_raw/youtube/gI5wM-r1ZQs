what is up YouTube welcome back to my channel sabaidee Dyson I could just start out by saying this is a ten out of ten instant classic just like I was saying to my final trailer reaction like I loved the Irishman as far as it being 3 hours and 29 minutes it does not feel like 3 hours and 29 minutes like you get every bit of what is going on and four 80s baby like myself who know who Jimmy Hoffa was know the circumstances around Jimmy Hoffa this movie puts it in perspective from Frank Sheeran's point of view I love it the de-aging CGI didn't bother me that much because I was just so in tune with the story you know and I feel like Joe Pesci playing Russell Bufalino Bar None deserves an Academy Award I love Robert De Niro ask Frank Sheeran I love Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa I love Harvey Keitel as Don Bruno and I just feel like everyone gave a great performance but Joe Pesci is bar none the most entertaining most it kept my my eyes glued to the screen every time Joe Pesci talks every time he has something to say it was just like the way he acted with people I love that because you would never think by looking at someone like that that they're a Mafia don you know like and just the fact that when I had you know what movies like these I do want to do my research so when I saw Russell Bufalino as the Bufalino crime family and and here is depicted as Russell Russell Bufalino like I'm not sure if he was a boss but it was drawing that tell playing Bruno as the boss and Russell Bufalino was just kind of like a concierge and turns out that Russell Bufalino was the one that was he was the silent Donnellan he was the actual box you know I'm saying I'm just kind of like God giant like dude you a piece like if you have everyone you know just if you took a liking to you that he protected you you look out to you one thing in particular that made me feel like Dan you you you that dude was when Frank Sheeran bombed the laundry um kinda like the laundry house or their like the industry with for the laundry try and do that that job for that guy that was like hey you know this you know it's in competition so Frank made so much money and bombed the laundry Factory and then he sat down with Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci and Harvick Keitel was just explaining to him like dude you know like what were you doing that for who are you doing that for and you just kinda like yeah this ain't the time for you to be silent like you better tell me cuz you know in in in so many subtle ways he's basically saying that your life depends upon it and Frank finally yeah you know the job I was doing affects your money and he was just like oh yeah you know this is what I I'm sorry that I did it you know I didn't mean to offend anybody you know just something I did and you know Harvey Keitel is like man yeah I was a silent partner and today you shouldn't did it it was unauthorized and just when he was saying you know do you know how good of a friend you got in Russell Bufalino and he was like friends like no you don't know and I was like dang and Joe Pesci just kinda like staring at him like yeah I just saved your life you know because you know Bruno is he wants your head for that like you know Mike anybody else will get killed because you Russell's friend and Russell delight don't do it cuz he didn't he really didn't know he got him off the hook so I was just like man he was like man basically you know I would have been sent you to another family you would probably got got you like you know if it wasn't for him and I'm just like damn like that's the pull that Russell Bufalino had and for the fact that when you fast forward when JFK got shot and at that party giving Frank Sheeran their awards and stuff like that and how Russell Bufalino was telling Frank Sheeran like man if you can whack a president may you could definitely wack a union boss he ain't no problem and you know here's Jimmy Hoffa Lima tango and dango do that like I'm I'm a political figure you know Mike I'm in the media like you ain't gonna do that like without having a heavy scrutiny you know like and Russell's like man you don't know what we capable of you know and I just love that effect because even with Joey Joey Gallo I remember watching that you know the document on Joey Gallo and it was just crazy how that carried out so I'm not sure if Frank was the one who really carried that hit out on crazy Joe Gallo but I was really enthralled with watching that documentary about Joey Gallo and how he was and I don't let that's a crazy dude boy and to say that Frank got him I'm like man you were deep in the mob and crazy enough Russell Bufalino I loved how they were showing that people hey this is new Angelo though this is a Sally and it's showing how at the bottom of the screen it's like yeah he got shot in the head eight times you know October 26 1980 and I might you've seen all these figure that they're running into talking to people and how they're getting killed you know after the event you know and Russell died which is very rare for mob boss to die of natural causes basically he lived out his whole life not getting assassinated not getting contract killed nothing so you knew that this dude was cool with every other Don that was in America probably even in Sicily nobody won in his head he didn't he didn't crossover nobody's toes even crossover but nobody's fingers and if he had to do a contract kill it was for a reason like because he that I do to be like man look you know we could talk things out but if you can't do that he meant business too that is major respect that was probably before the Philly mob had carmine the snake I forgot his last name but I really like I said I love mob movies I love mob documentaries but this was all before carmine the snake came in to Philly and made Philly a dangerous place to be fusing ma you know and like I said I run that Jimmy Hoffa time there's there's a lot of speculation to the theory of Frank sharing with a lot of other theories that who killed Jimmy Hoffa but with this this put me at ease to know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa this looks this looks and sounds a little bit more believable because who else would have got really close to Jimmy Hoffa but at the same time when I looked at the documents for Jimmy Hoffa they never once mentioned and Frank Sheeran next to him many photos so I don't know how true or believable I feel like this is but it feels very believable just by the I heard you pay houses I love that I love that slogan I love the book I haven't read it but I love it makes this makes me want to read it to understand what else they were doing around that time a revolving around Frank Sharon's life and it just shows how huge is a hardened criminal and it made his daughters kind of look at him differently and you could tell that he was so into the life that his his kids were like I can't you know I have no relationship with you because he's a cold-hearted killer you know and Frank knew that Frank knew that that's why I'm just like to live out his life the way he did he knew that the whole time right you know I'm like he just was in the life that's just what that's what it does to you you know it's just like being in the war and as he mentioned frequently endless like it's just like being that war it's like you know this is what it is so I loved every minute of it this is like I said an instant classic I'm definitely gonna check this out again whenever it's like a year or two three years down the road this is going to be instant classic and if in his shock just like Goodfellas and away you know and that's why I was like him somebody's getting the wars for this Netflix got him one finally cuz then he plus was like yeah we you know we only tell Netflix got them one with this definitely like I said ten out of ten I love the performances I love the dialogue it's a slow burn dialogue and I missed that and movies where it's not a lot of action you don't need it you just need to pay attention to the dialogue into the story like you have to pay attention to understand the next scene I've missed that in movies and this movie carried it out to perfection
