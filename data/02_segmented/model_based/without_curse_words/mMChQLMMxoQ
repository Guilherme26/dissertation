Yeah, what's up? I'm T. this is real tapes. shut up and sit down today. We're gonna talk about inside out by Disney Pixar. I'm joy, Mrs. sadness, That's anger. Got this is discussed and that's fear. We're Riley's emotions. That one was probably one of the worst bringing others. I've seen. your lotions don't really work that way and it got confusing. Like the whole thing, Just stupid. You don't really have like little glass orbs that tell your happiness and your sadness and all that other stuff. Can I say the curse word? Now crappy-ass it won't be this movie sucked. Think positive. I'm positive this movie shopped ass. It made me feel exhausted and depressed and was that lame that it made me want to go to sleep because it was sad. It was pathetic. Oh boy, you can't focus on what's going wrong. There's always a way to turn things around. The 3d aspect in the movie. Shocked because I've seen a lot of other 3d movies and this one just totally blown It shocked. those bastards just made it in 3d to make more money. What's a freak? I would give this movie like two two and a half stars for arrangement, because it was that bad. I might see Terminator next week. Who knows? That's it.
