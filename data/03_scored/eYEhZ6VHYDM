deer I was surprised by his ability to make such a dark and unsettling story,0.10365879
with really complex characters and subject matter because I had seen the lobster before that,0.047073826
but I have to be honest I didn't really care for it all that much,0.062619954
I still think it's due Murray watch at this point but I didn't really appreciate,0.061005108

with me but yeah I wasn't in love with it as much as everyone else,0.15208937
was sacred deer though that's that's probably my favorite even now honestly but this movie,0.04635258
is quite unexpected I think what are these noises with the lobster and sacred deer,0.08113406
you could say that they break conventions quite a bit they're really wacky and strange,0.45234525
and have a very weird story and very strange and off characters you can say,0.07375573
the same here but the story is somewhat more accessible being a period drama of,0.070228234
sorts although Jurgis has no doubt flipped it on its head a little bit let's,0.3406527
talk performances before we get into all that though why the hell is no-one discussing,0.5621314
Nicholas Hoult that dude had me howling with laughter in pretty much every scene that,0.1172012
he was in oh my god that made his character absolutely ridiculous but so entertaining,0.640066
I really loved him and miss stone was pretty great here I'm not one of,0.14498377
those people who goes really mad over her and I've never really seen the big,0.18641809
deal about her but as much as everyone else seems to but I did like,0.105887674
her here I always just like her really which I guess is a bit of,0.13002779
a shame because I'm not really seeing what everyone else seems to but I'm glad,0.1496012
that I at least enjoyed the performance not many of the characters about likable but,0.055011358
she is especially not that likable here she's a very selfish character but she does,0.6623531
have a lot of brilliant dialogue that makes it all worthwhile Rachel Weisz is terrific,0.059594866
as usual I always loved her and she sells this role great with her really,0.08888331
dark and witty character manner which never really failed to make me feel on edge,0.08250445
something about her character is just someone settling because of the way that she treats,0.08984681
the people around her but it's played so well that I can't really help but,0.09503082
love it just listen to my cat for a second at the door not the,0.07738042
best performance for me without a doubt is Olivia Colman it's actually been amazing to,0.17446743
see how she's got to this point just from being lovely Sophie on Peep Show,0.1011359
to Tyrannosaur where she was unbelievably brilliant and honestly oscar-worthy as well even more so,0.1755084
than this role I would say and now to the point where she's actually a,0.08546055
contender to win an Oscar I'm actually really proud of her for getting to this,0.14444178
point really hoping that she wins it honestly her performance is spectacular here she encapsulate,0.15307492
s' Queen and in such a strange and unique way often she is sad as,0.18742147
or extremely angry or sweet and kind or very loving and appreciative I can't vouch,0.07850666
for how historically accurate the treatment of these characters is or the treatment of her,0.075027466
relationship with Rachel Weisz but it's still very entertaining to watch sometimes Olivia just made,0.09030847
me want to cry though she's so sad I've read up on the film a,0.15641664
little bit and there's some historical experts who say that it's not all entirely true,0.08315596
some of it just kind of goes off rumors that circled around the place at,0.066312015
that time somebody just kind of made up for entertainment value and some is completely,0.07610944
accurate whatever it is you can trust your ghost to make it entertaining and to,0.1506651
fit the script and the film itself he really did a number on this movie,0.07093656
taking this story and these people and turning them way upside down making something so,0.15380001
utterly unique funny crushing dark and weird as hell the script isn't written by him,0.40532738
but he's the perfect person to helm the film I think historical films can be,0.08262536
a bore we've got plenty that tell it in a completely honest and accurate way,0.08273504
and show it all in a really kind of boring and just lifeless way the,0.43372613
post with this one we get hints of accuracy for the historical parts but its,0.07871397
story is exaggerated to the point of no return I also love that the camerawork,0.076678514
is so out of whack you never know when it's gonna be like high up,0.48615962
or low down or a fisheye or not a fisheye it's really quite disorientating I,0.071172155
think I quite loved it for that the characters are what really make the film,0.050993808
work in the long run it's sort of a power play type story and it's,0.033234794
great because you never really know what any given person's motives are there's barely a,0.17415896
moment alone with each character so you don't really get to see what their end,0.065311044
game is or what they're planning or anything which I think reentered a lot of,0.11998777
mystery there's some great comedic value as well the dialogue alone is incredibly witty and,0.07193343
Alerus and the dance scene had me laughing so much and I love that the,0.09431003
men in the film are just so absurd and almost have this kind of slapstick,0.6128169
dialogue but at the heart of it there is definitely something more serious you can,0.06578764
get a big load of tragedy on top of all the ridiculousness because at the,0.7445975
end of the day it's centered around a woman who is very sad has suicidal,0.5233076
