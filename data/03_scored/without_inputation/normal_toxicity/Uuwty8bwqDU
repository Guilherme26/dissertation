commented it when i saw the trailer and said the the images that we were,0.05428788
seeing visually matched the beauty of the paintings that we were being shown as well,0.051123124
from the moment marianne arrives on the island and we get this beautiful shot look,0.22675598
at this beautiful shot the framing of the shot the time of day in which,0.35048681
it was shot the detail of line and color is absolutely exquisite and then a,0.1155295

drying out and her materials are drying out and she's just sitting in front of,0.17297642
the fireplace and she's smoking her pipe the beauty of not only the visual of,0.40330625

the fire crackling hear the wood creaking the wind blowing in the background this film,0.088447325
reminded me in its attention to my minutia in sound and visual beauty of phantom,0.091712065
thread if you haven't seen phantom thread with daniel d lewis please see it it's,0.10668581
a very different film but it has similarities in terms of it being a period,0.06760114
piece that's very comparable to this as well as it being higher level elegance and,0.15150674
an attention to the smallest of sound details and i'm a big fan of small,0.1004106
details even more than i am of big details i love bombast i love massive,0.08180728
uh visual effects of all kinds whether they be makeup or cgi but i'm a,0.11346977
big fan of small small things in cinema and the smallness of things that are,0.10348062
captured in this that help convey the story in the most profound of ways it's,0.04786847
just like in phantom thread where there are moments where you need to have things,0.12810318
so quiet that you can hear the needle and thread going through the fabric you,0.09390376
need to hear the wooden spoon tapping on the bottom of the pan and the,0.15641585
bubbling of the butter as it's cooking mushrooms you need to hear the pen as,0.14946577
it's writing on the page you need to hear the wind blowing in the trees,0.12188188
this film is that kind of a film and the writing like everything else in,0.06429678
the film is top notch that acting from our two leading ladies and all of,0.053031452
the supporting ladies absolutely top notch i added this movie to my list of not,0.0974642
only favorite films of all time but this one's gonna stay with me for the,0.06923345
rest of my life not only for the artistic reasons i've just talked to you,0.26756462
about but because of some of the things i'm about to talk about when we,0.058739133
get into the more spoiler side of things for those of you who've seen the,0.15493372
film this this film is probably going to remain in my top 10 favorite motion,0.08882997
pictures of all time i cannot wait to watch this film with my children and,0.3112323
particularly with my daughters and i feel a level of total disqualification to talk about,0.1512093
the messages of the film for two reasons number one is it's definitively a woman,0.1614941
film at every level not just because it was created by in the writing and,0.07944134
the directing and then the cast and crew driven by women but because i i,0.4031589
only look at that as an outsider i can only sympathize with what a woman,0.3114708
goes through i cannot empathize and i feel that i not only have a disqualification,0.14170505
in that regard i feel like i have a disqualification in regard to articulating it,0.07137962
in any way that's better than the film itself it's one of the rare films,0.08655202
that i feel like i don't have much to say about it other than i,0.09211094
love it and it's so magnificent and i can point out some things but the,0.07736666
deeper issues it talks about that are the world and the life of a woman,0.31089434
there's nothing i can say the film doesn't say for itself you know the old,0.0736037
phrase a picture's worth a thousand words a movie's worth 10 million i wish everyone,0.08391996
had seen this film and i i simply cannot believe that this film was not,0.112166286
nominated and paid attention to i can't imagine academy members saw this film and did,0.065726355
not jump up and down and it was it was screened at the cannes film,0.1426862
festival so i really would like to know what it is that caused people to,0.24189395
not pay attention to this film how corbin and i miss this film and i'm,0.14368026
so excited that this is the first film that we're jumping into it was the,0.11726348
first reaction i did and it's the first review that i'm doing and it makes,0.08070903
me so happy because if this is a harbinger of things to come we are,0.14062718
in for the kind of magnificent life-changing and enriching ride i knew we would get,0.1435319
into when adroni and i started talking about this and i was losing sleep over,0.15075168
it because this is what movies are supposed to be this kind of a film,0.15090536
so for those of you who haven't seen the film leave now please and go,0.07213865
watch it and then come back because i'm now getting it again some some spoilers,0.11638962
and moments of the film that are specific so this is it my mantra is,0.041206002
let the movie tell the story if you haven't seen the movie go watch it,0.06289443
and then come back and pick up right here look at the time stamp see,0.06611314
where you are you can pick it up right here and then join us for,0.077835366
the rest of this spoiler time that final moment when she's sitting there listening to,0.10424996
the song and you you do know i hope you all picked up on the,0.15453608
fact that the song that eloise is listening to is the exact same song that,0.07416401
marianne played for her on the harpsichord and that moment where celine stiama is allowing,0.075230755
the camera to just sit on eloise and let her go through all of the,0.15349287
emotions in that moment that you know what it is she's thinking about and feeling,0.09870888
about it's it's a perfect ending to what is in my opinion a perfect film,0.24135387
that moment is you feel everything that she's feeling in that moment and to just,0.115704894
let the camera sit on her and let the actress be in that moment and,0.3343177
let us feel everything with her immediately following a moment that really set the table,0.05667281
for it the emotional profundity of that moment was really predicated on obviously the whole,0.089163125
film prior but that moment where marianne is in the art gallery and she walks,0.06802865
up and she sees the painting and she's not only getting to see eloise again,0.10761375
but she looks down and sees that eloise has a little girl and then she,0.38475236
looks at the book and she looks at the hands and then she sees the,0.078202195
page has been opened to page 28. i don't know about you but that that,0.15204234
made me cry and then i was just buckets of tears at the end when,0.09878588
she's listening to that orchestra and you do realize and it's one of the reasons,0.24174121
i recommended watching it and making sure you hear every little nuance of sound is,0.08768025
there is no score until an hour and 15 minutes and it is so powerful,0.09328744
and so magnificent that this woman-centric film has as its first expression of music nothing,0.31780723
but women's voices that just start to rise at this fire and then go into,0.4679574
that beautiful song and after you haven't heard any music to have the musical thing,0.07995394
that hits you be just the voices of women it's there's nothing i can say,0.47063458
that it didn't say itself it's so profound it's so powerful it's so beautiful and,0.07702015
the symbolism and the double meanings triple meanings of the title portrait of a lady,0.13797328
on fire which lady both ladies the first time we actually see physical fire is,0.2571082
when marianne is looking at the picture of eloise that has no face on it,0.14967395
and she's looking at it and she gets the candle too close to the canvas,0.18807265
and it ignites and it ignites right where her right where the heart is on,0.15851039
eloise i really wish i i read some things about the film i really wish,0.076053225
this movie wasn't uh categorized or set off to the side as a lesbian film,0.4794475
or a gay film there's so many people who won't see this film because they'll,0.6280689
avoid it because it's been called the lesbian film don't tell people that's what it,0.5876557
is tell them what it is it's a love story and leave it alone and,0.06930711
let it be what it is and it's more than a love story this film,0.09531591
is from my uh personal opinion i can't think of a film that for me,0.12192493
is a more extraordinarily powerful film to point out and go you want to see,0.17308645
a movie about women right there and you want to see it done in a,0.19433963
way that's so masterful that you're going to be left indelibly imprinted for the rest,0.14963713
of your life if you don't feel that way after seeing the film i truly,0.23099537
don't understand other than there's something else going on in terms of attention deficit or,0.05395876
it's just really not your cup of tea to sit and watch a sunset things,0.27300793
that have a pace that hearken back to times that were not as frenetic and,0.111374035
frenzied as today which has been for the most of the history of the world,0.06675167
that you don't that you prefer driving through fast food restaurants rather than sitting down,0.103141375
to a nice meal and enjoying a cup of wine you'd rather down some shots,0.35965678
there's a time and a place for the shots and the fast food and things,0.1554292
of that nature but man you give me the slow burns every day you give,0.46042523
me the sit in front of the fires the savoring the glass of wine the,0.24016032
taking slow bites of a five course meal over the course of two hours long,0.15878229
