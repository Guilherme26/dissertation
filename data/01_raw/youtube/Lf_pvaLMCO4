[Music] how everyone today I'll be reviewing it happens one night so it happened one night was directed by Frank Capra and stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and assume come out in 1934 which was only a few years into the sound era but before the Hays Code era which enforced lots of censorship on films at the start of this film we see call that Colver she plays a rich woman and she's on this boat with her father and her father she's trying to convince her not to marry this man say cold call that Kolbert she wants to marry this man but her father basically doesn't agree with it really so cool at hobart she escapes in the boat and she basically tries to escape and go across to New York City to find the man that she wants to marry so then we see Clark april's character come in so Clark Gable he plays a man who works for a newspaper he's always looking for a good story and he comes across call that colder and he then she realizes that she is on the blunt from her family in order to marry this man that she wants to marry so Clark they have always thinking okay I've got a great story here maybe I can make something of this so this film really does so well is blend comedy with a romance well a rom-com really obviously and this is one of the best well as opposed to one of the best classic long comes from the era now I myself I'm not necessarily a big fan of romantic comedies especially for this sort of era but I think this is very good this film it's it's actually surprisingly funny I found myself chuckling a few times I thought it was very funny and lots of bits I really like Clark Gable in this film I've only seen Clark Gable in one other film gone with the winds and he was very good in that but he's a lot funny in this film he has lots of witty lines a lot the things he says seem very well timed and it's just very funny and I really like a chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert every scene they're in together is going to see quite a lot the film they work off each other really well and the two characters they're always trying to one-up each other in each scene so as I seen a star where Clark Gable was trying to get a seat on my bus but all that Colbert takes a seat first and then the bus driver says it's first-come first-serve and then later on there's a scene where Claudette Colbert misses her bus so then quite cables just sat there smiling and it's all these sorts of things which work really well in making us like these characters and both these actors in these roles they're both such likeable characters it's impossible not to like these two and it just makes for a very light-hearted film though are a few darker little bits here and there it's not happy all the way through but obviously the overall tone of the film is very happy and very enjoyable now this film did very well at the Oscars actually won the five big main Oscars which are Best Picture Best Director for Frank Capra Best Actor for Clark Gable Best Actress for pulled at holder and Best Adapted Screenplay now there's only two other films or one those all those five big main Oscars and that is one flow the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and then the silence around in 1991 one of my favorite scenes in this film is when Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on a coach together and then everybody on the coach is singing along to the spans that is playing at the back of the bus and is playing this song called the man with the flying trapeze and everyone on the bus kind of joins in with the singing and they all sing different parts of the verses and it's just a very enjoyable scenes it's a very like all scenery set on the film really well another scene which is really clever actually is a scene where Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert trying to hitchhike so staying at the side of the road and Clark Gable he thinks is really clever he think he knows all the different ways to get the cars attention by waving her arms in a certain way or stick a knightly thumb in a certain way and all it's get the driver's attention and he tries lots of different variants it tries about six or seven times he throws every time so then call that Kolbert she comes up and she just sticks her leg out and it says go up above the knee and then the first driver stop straightaway that's a very funny scene another scene which is really famous film actually when they're on the bus there's his character called Oscar Shapley who is sitting next to cool debt Colbert's character and he's a character who talked to really quickly and he's obviously very attracted to pull that whole box so he gets so he's saying all these things that are trying pressor and he's just a very funny quite annoying character and there's a few very funny scenes which is in which stand out quite a lot and his character was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny and it was actually a scene where Clark Gable is leaning on a fence and is eating the carrot and that also was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny as well in terms of what I don't like about this film I suppose the plot is a little bit predictable especially the the way the film ends is quite standard really you almost expect it to end a certain way well I did anyway from my point of view I found ending a little bit predictable not that's a bad thing but there are some other romance films particularly ones like Casablanca which end in a way that you don't expect roses film ends in a way which I was expecting I could almost see it going in this direction and I wasn't surprised by how the film ended at all I was not to say that I didn't like how the film ended I did like the way it ended but it just it wasn't that surprising perhaps a little bit predictable but again that's not necessarily a bad thing so all in all I have to say that it happened one night is a fantastic romantic comedy I think most people should be able to enjoy this it's it's a fairly easy film to watch these two characters quite a bond call that although they're both such likeable characters in this film the on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic and overall it's a very enjoyable film to watch so I'm going to give and one night a rating of 8 out of 10 I don't think it's a fantastic bill but I do think it's a very good classic romantic comedy and probably one of the best romantic comedies from this sort of error that I've seen so there we go so that is it happened one night so what do you guys think have you seen it happen tonight would you like to see it let me know down in the comments what your thoughts are anyway thank you all very much watching I'll see you in the next video take care
