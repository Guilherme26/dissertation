so you have a wonder woman sequel for me yes sir i do so we're,0.4032173
gonna start the movie with diana as a kid back in themyscira okay okay and,0.24188553
what's she up to well she's competing in the amazon version of that tv show,0.072078824
wipeout and she tries to use a shortcut to win and learns that cheating is,0.24064426
wrong sure okay that's a nice quick message to start the movie off it's gonna,0.17592931
take a full 11 minutes oh my god so then we're going to jump forward,0.15063067
to the 1980s which is when this movie takes place okay okay so like 30,0.07493116
40 years ago oh i don't enjoy that that's a true thing so anyway diana,0.16322388
is still super heartbroken about steve trevor dying in the first movie he's all she,0.19378522
can think about really after all that time yeah well i mean you gotta understand,0.15378854
this was a really good guy she knew for a couple of days seven decades,0.07049583
ago well yeah i guess so so anyway diane is working in washington dc at,0.08239381
the smithsonian and she has a new co-worker named barbara what's her deal oh she's,0.096568406
a freaking nerd sir she can't even walk in heels oh embarrassing disgusting and pathetic,0.93415904
i bet nobody likes her yeah and so there's this artifact called the dream stone,0.18884271
and that's what this movie's going to focus on oh what's this thing dude oh,0.089572
this thing's freaking nuts it grants wishes but it takes something in return a very,0.560722
magical stone and this phony business guy max lord he gets his hand on it,0.4502602
and he wishes to become the dreamstone oh so he turns to stone you would,0.19616444
think so the way that was phrased but no now he can grant people's wishes,0.08935537
when they touch him and he can take something in return do barbara and diana,0.1512911
get wishes in before he does that they do barbara wishes to be more like,0.10608893
diana so she gets some nice clothes and some super strength and now she can,0.1861976
walk in heels now that's impressive am i right yeah she's not pathetic anymore also,0.66346794
she removes her glasses which as you know makes people automatically more attractive that's just,0.24156462
good character development is what that is and so diana's gonna wish for steve trevor,0.09117831
to come back to life and this way we could get chris pine back in,0.15258533
the movie oh people like chris pine so what does he just appear out of,0.1528504
thin air actually no his consciousness goes into this random guy's body so everybody sees,0.4141388
this random guy but we see chris pine okay is this because the stone can't,0.13323997
make things just magically show up no it absolutely can a giant wall is going,0.105509125
to appear out of nowhere so are some nukes i mean the thing is magic,0.17772512
why are we doing this weird body control thing with steve i don't know what,0.26314384
happens to this guy's consciousness while steve's controlling his body who's to say you are,0.45854014
yeah what if this guy has a job and a family he has to get,0.15222347
to the implications are insane where is his consciousness is he dead oh well here's,0.36642563
the thing sir i'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back,0.11830746
about this body control thing get off of it oh that felt vaguely threatening so,0.12209267
i'm gonna get off your back about that great and so then steve and diana,0.3579244
obviously they get intimate because you know they love each other they do that using,0.1434418
a stranger's body that's got that's got to be crossing a line that's not okay,0.10375407
yeah well we're going to have them do it anyway and i find it strange,0.10292523
that you immediately got back on my back about that i mean it's actually a,0.12805349
really easy fix just have steve trevor show up as himself no so then that,0.14223659
max lord guy makes himself super rich and he goes to egypt to take some,0.09820711
guy's oil and make himself even richer okay so steve and diana they gotta get,0.15487635
over there you know how are they gonna do that well the thing is they,0.045831222
can't just take a commercial flight because steve doesn't have a passport no i mean,0.07743115
the guy he's possessing probably has one yeah well they don't check for that they,0.08915409
head to the smithsonian and steal one of the jets from over there they have,0.3722468
operational jets at the museum they do yeah fully fuel jets just lying around so,0.18273726
they take one of those because steve was a pilot okay he was a pilot,0.08947306
in world war one these are those those are different planes well i mean a,0.22748457
plane is a plane that's i mean okay yeah that sentence is not technically wrong,0.09764207
so there you go but okay sir a plane is a plane are you implying,0.0846791
that a plane's not a plane because a plane is a plane i mean that's,0.09519048
just such a vague general statement a plane is a plane okay so then they're,0.18764794
being chased because of the jet theft and so wonder woman goes ahead and makes,0.17515795
it invisible and that's how she gets her invisible jet what how well turns out,0.15164071
that's a thing she can do so she does the thing that she can do,0.08617669
well thank god she has that ability we never once mentioned a reference it works,0.12374895
out great so they go to egypt and they have a big chase scene with,0.11718343
max lord oh very exciting but he freaking gets away and he goes around causing,0.5154597
a bunch more chaos then he goes to see the president of the united states,0.32077047
what for well he gets the president to wish for more nukes and then he,0.15946245
sees this technology just lying around in the oval office and it's exactly what he,0.32454595
needs what do you mean what's this device that lets him take over everybody's screen,0.12657505
around the world so technically through like satellite waves he is you know he's touching,0.24095842
them how i don't worry about it okay it won't so then there's gonna be,0.098697
this fight in the white house and barbara she's turning evil so she gets in,0.43806535
on that too okay and steve manages to grab max lord oh and so he,0.12853223
wishes for everything to go back to normal oh yeah no that would have been,0.12932989
smart instead he pushes him around a bit also a decent strategy yeah so then,0.09328237
max lord escapes and he heads off to the satellite island to do his broadcast,0.26847523
wow wow wow and steve and diana find out that everybody needs to renounce their,0.13452163
wishes or else civilization's gonna end so they have this big emotional goodbye oh very,0.15332426
sad very sad but then she starts to fly and lasso some lightning bolts so,0.11023833
that's pretty cool that's that's not bad oh sure yeah that may as well happen,0.09892231
so then diana's gonna have to fight barbara who by the way is a cat,0.25094748
now what yeah she's a cat now she's part cheetah what are you talking about,0.18482722
well see max lord was like hey anything else you want and she's like yes,0.14969371
actually i would like to be an apex predator please so she could have just,0.5154597
as easily been turned into a killer whale yeah i guess there was a chance,0.2974364
she could have turned into a you know orca whale but that would have made,0.23786648
for a less interesting fight scene oh i wholeheartedly disagree anyway so then we're gonna,0.11983323
have a barely visible fight scene and barbara's gonna get electrocuted oh so she dies,0.50051033
oh no she gets a little sleepy which is what happens when cats get electrocuted,0.1898216
that's not no i don't think that's accurate well that's what my dad told me,0.06644025
when my childhood cat chewed through his extension cord that your cat died i think,0.53490317
no sir he went to sleep then he went to live on a farm and,0.14888886
i never saw him again i mean okay so what happens next oh well max,0.18801408
is granting wishes to everybody in the world through their screens most of the world,0.105646946
doesn't speak english okay yeah i'll keep that in mind for trivia night i guess,0.1525002
that's interesting anyway it's gonna be complete chaos oh it is yep people are killing,0.24819784
each other with wishes one guy gets a farm outside his apartment people can wish,0.14041556
for anything really yeah it's gonna be nuts statistically speaking wouldn't at least one person,0.2672797
wish for the guy that just showed up on their tv to die or for,0.4699664
the world to end wouldn't at least one person wish for world peace what happens,0.11227352
with that paradox well i mean that's got that's like a one in a million,0.11035116
kind of wish right there are billions of people in the world you're just full,0.11290728
of fun trivia tonight so anyway diana has to lasso this guy but her lasso,0.26650202
can't get through this mysterious wind around him oh wow it's gonna be tough for,0.077780865
her to defeat him if she can't reach him actually it's gonna be super easy,0.21479341
barely an inconvenience oh really yeah see she gets her lasso around his ankle and,0.24072914
then she can talk to everybody through him i thought she couldn't get through with,0.14196736
that thing oh yeah no she couldn't but then she could but how unclear well,0.22310662
okay then so then she tells everybody to renounce their wishes because nothing good comes,0.15235467
from lying and everybody does it everybody does it including max lord who suddenly cares,0.4031955
about his son that he's been actively ignoring the whole movie and so what about,0.17425004
like what if someone with a terminal illness wished to be cured oh well they,0.38984177
would have they would have to renounce that because that's that's not the truth uh,0.08952469
what if a blind person wished to be able to see that's uh that's that's,0.28111073
a shortcut uh to being able to see so that's that's wrong what if somebody,0.13428718
wished to be able to feed their starving child yeah okay this moment only works,0.43111023
if everybody wishes for something selfish or violent so we're gonna have to pretend like,0.16970478
that's the case okay oh pretending is tight okay let's do it okay thank god,0.15151705
so then max lord is gonna go reunite with his son who just kind of,0.099187225
comes running out of the woods for no reason how did max lord get back,0.086611584
from the island if he renounced all his wishes unclear and what happens with barbara,0.100608334
well she's not a cat anymore and she's she's chilling i imagine okay anyway then,0.30458614
diana's gonna have a little flirty moment with the guy who steve was controlling it's,0.18035401
gonna be very sweet he's already seen that guy naked yeah just a real sweet,0.5070777
moment it's gonna be christmas too yeah i don't know if it being christmas makes,0.086143896
it better and then she looks at a balloon and we're all done so what,0.10032484
do you think i mean i feel like using a strange man's body is just,0.2782728
so deeply strange and raises so many messed up questions right right right well maybe,0.06942607
nobody will think of how weird it is well yeah i guess that is a,0.13156156
possibility okay let's do it hey guys ryan here thanks for watching that pitch meeting,0.1358216
