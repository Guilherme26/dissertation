hello and welcome back to mac at the movies today i'm going to review for,0.032870714
you the 2019 french film portrait of a lady on fire uh this was directed,0.21876228
by celine siama who also directed waterlily's girlhood tomboy and my life as a zucchini,0.51372474
which later got a u.s release all done by american voice actors it's a it's,0.043652013
a claymated film nick alfriman michael sarah few people are in it really good film,0.0569783
check it out this one was released on lily's lily's films uh september 18th 2019,0.0788675
uh it stars adele han hanel who plays heloise uh noemie merlant who plays mariana,0.05198011
luana beijirim luana beijrami who plays sophie and valerie gallino who plays d the mother,0.05691444
d doesn't uh play a huge role throughout the film it primarily follows heloise uh,0.011459784
mariana who is the woman who is hired to paint heloise and sophie who is,0.054541733
essentially like a chamber girl maid if you will in the film the film does,0.10749767
take place in france and it was filmed primarily uh in uh brittany uh they,0.055296052
just wanted the beautiful landscapes and it is beautiful when you see it it i,0.055432413
mean it it's a period piece but i don't believe that anywhere in the film,0.042567097
they discuss a matter of what year or time period i know the director has,0.020867476
stated in the past that some of the movies that she's done she doesn't want,0.03709064
to give an exact timeline that just wants to focus on the film itself as,0.010434071
like a piece of art and by having a timeline it sort of takes away,0.08096948
from the overall story and kind of gives you know question of why would they,0.014030053
be using this particular cell phone and this year you know things like that so,0.03134412
by taking that out of the picture you're kind of given this you know ambiguous,0.05048611
timeline of when the the film could have been taken place um a good example,0.015835362
of that if any of you have seen the horror film it follows um it's,0.037623454
kind of left to the ambiguity of time because like the device is being used,0.022138642
or anything being used isn't really time um it can't really put a time stamp,0.03619131
on when the film takes place uh which i feel really brings you into the,0.05695635
picture as a whole um i mean this is obvious obviously a time piece is,0.0349401
takes place a long long time ago um and you know that's kind of what,0.0675494
you know and so it allows you to really get into the story um all,0.020858828
in all i love this movie uh which i'll talk about later um and and,0.075975284
what i liked more about it uh so mariana she is hired to paint eloise,0.045572396
who is uh dee's daughter she's brought in they've had people other artists brought in,0.089227736
to paint before but i suppose the paintings were never to the liking of uh,0.020208279
heloise and she you know she would destroy the painting something would happen it just,0.19123764
wouldn't get done um which i'll discuss here in a minute or reasons why i,0.030808646
think that happened um so she's brought in to essentially paint the portrait of heloise,0.029438367
in secret so she spends a lot of time she's she's brought in to to,0.05382267
to spend time with eloise and to you know get a good memory of what,0.029796902
she looks like you know taking notes along the way she she brings um you,0.06701127
know just a little sketching pieces of paper to you know if she notices the,0.07580699
way she places her hands things like that so she has to essentially put this,0.10511232
portrait together by memory one thing i i enjoy is the the times that they,0.060206436
spin together they start to learn about one another you find out that at the,0.02821709
beginning of the film elise's sister died she jumped off a cliff some people thought,0.08568164
it was an accident um sophie the the the chambermaid she believes that the sister,0.14155707
jumped uh intentionally uh and when uh mariana asked her why she thought that she,0.09847245
said because when it happened she didn't cry out she just turned around she was,0.02986874
gone and looked over and and noticed that that she had left to her death,0.2809915
um hello east and mariana they talk on the beach uh later in the film,0.035659164
uh marianna's trying to get more information about luis and like who she is to,0.035130344
i supposed to you know spend more time with her of course because she has,0.033155415
to get that image of her in her memory to to create the portrait but,0.037806377
she's not afraid to ask questions that other people may have tiptoed around like the,0.12085655
death of her sister what happened and so one of the questions she brings up,0.6313608
is you know she asked like what about your sister's death you know she finds,0.4670596
out that uh that it was and uh there was an apology letter left behind,0.037425227
and she asked like why what did she apologize about and eloise tells her essentially,0.031449884
she apologized for passing her fate along to her sister which later gets discussed like,0.08851931
what fate and that's when the idea of an arranged marriage a a more in-depth,0.03370685
understanding of an arranged marriage that's going to be taking place between uh eloise and,0.04607195
another man who she's never met so this is when i start to understand that,0.15659754
it's not so much that eloise doesn't want her portrait taken like once her portrait,0.087005354
created i think it's more of a not wanting an example of a time that,0.06565362
she can look back to and say this is when i was happy that's what,0.04774622
i gathered from it anyway so you kind of see that she's unhappy with the,0.14866589
idea that she's going to have this arranged marriage and any time that there is,0.047786795
a portrait done of her she either protests sitting for it or there there's a,0.13245736
destruction of the the portrait where you see the the the one portrait the last,0.1927649
one that was done the face was smudged out i i think the the reason,0.068043634
behind all that is that she doesn't want this example of a time that was,0.059988257
better so if she's in this you know miserable uh marriage like she doesn't want,0.26475364
to remember that there ever was happiness before that she just wants to know what,0.024614455
is so maybe a portrait made after her being married it would just signify what,0.04001412
you know she knows from that point she has no memory or anything to remind,0.07495555
her of what would you know make her think about those moments um the you,0.059432827
know the mariana she is essentially she is made to follow louise uh again to,0.015822059
get to know her but she is suggested to let her go on her own,0.024683634
one day um which heloise did not understand really um and which i get you,0.08831909
know that's the sort of the point that she's there is to be like she,0.03195542
doesn't know that she's painting the portrait so she just thinks she's there to accompany,0.04458992
her to make sure i suppose she doesn't do anything brash on her own and,0.17807963
mariana suggests she go by herself one day you know just six suggests solitude and,0.030873168
when she does that uh eloise comes back she returns after that and she was,0.043795027
just like you know that was a great idea you know i i had all,0.045245126
this time to to think about this and think about that she you know asked,0.033730797
like what she thought about and she louise tells mariana that she thought about how,0.056519326
she missed her so she kind of introduces this idea of solitude and how you,0.05672886
can you know how how solitude can sort of give a person time to think,0.041124314
about other things or other people and how if you weren't alone to your own,0.03872034
devices would you ever have those thoughts and and i like the idea of that,0.06095277
um you know one thing i personally like to do uh myself is a lot,0.118863665
of things by myself so you know going out to a restaurant and just having,0.016938902
a you know one-person meal and just enjoying my time alone or going to a,0.052318025
movie by myself there's just me involved in that movie and you know it just,0.025255028
lets me think instead of having that well you know while i love you know,0.026347924
going out to eat or going to a movie or hanging out in a park,0.19076869
or something like that with other people you know it's a different experience on how,0.025940832
you interpret your thoughts or what you might want to do so i i like,0.025598262
that this allowed her to introduce a feeling of longing in her and that you,0.063446544
know a feeling that she wouldn't or may not have felt otherwise if she was,0.040037405
accompanied by mariana um at one point and i think it signifies uh you know,0.0350452
it just an igniting of passion but mariana's looking at the previous portrait of eloise,0.050529346
and with the the smudged face and she has the you know it's all done,0.06081907
by candlelight and she's you know looking at this portrait and you know right when,0.028308885
she gets around to the area of the heart the portrait catches fire and mariana,0.0863874
just sort of steps back and watches it happen until later it's you know transferred,0.027942369
to the the fireplace to to finish burning and i think that it's both you,0.25274992
know a symbol of igniting passion uh in heloise and the the significance of the,0.04029616
burning of the the complete portrait is a way to start over and start fresh,0.2656743
so it's it's not so much as you know that she was trying to destroy,0.11407035
something as the the director was trying to you know symbolize the future passion and,0.021420244
starting anew uh also in the film uh there are moments where uh marianne uh,0.030221289
she sees a ghost uh like a ghost image of heloise uh in what i,0.16172078
i you know it kind of symbolized it looked like a like a nightgown but,0.081757724
also a wedding dress so it seems like there's also a growing passion in her,0.044867966
and that she's being haunted by that and the the the semblance and of just,0.07002455
like her feelings of you know what's going to happen like what's going to come,0.061858755
and to take whatever you know time she can uh you know because she's just,0.07427241
being haunted by what's going to be uh beyond that there's while they're let me,0.024955695
backtrack a second the portrait that does by memory uh gets destroyed she looks the,0.08767852
the portrait with eloise and realizes that um it's not her like i mean it's,0.09042639
her but it's not her um so they destroy the photo the mother gets upset,0.24194165
and heloise decides to sit for the the portrait which you know baffles her mother,0.120102234
so her mother allows her to allows mariana to stay around and complete the portrait,0.12553746
as eloise is sitting in for it while they're they're making the the portrait uh,0.032256085
mariana is looking at elise and like describing how she needs to pose or you,0.10805177
know about her smile or just little bitty actions um that that she's doing describing,0.09575119
those actions uh eloise at one point in time tells her to stop stop what,0.09144413
she's doing and to come over to her um sort of like it it feels,0.15693411
like an order like stop what you're doing come here like we're gonna talk and,0.071005695
it ends up being like a like i'm gonna turn the the table on you,0.12088648
like look at you know the the direction i'm seeing you from and then she,0.051839758
starts describing little nuances like mariana described of her and you you sort of see,0.2347391
this like passion building um you know i feel like if this was an american,0.13085426
film they would have you know started passionately making love or whatever that given scene,0.0847577
but what i liked about this is that it allowed that passion to build and,0.033313062
grow which you see later and done in private and i i really like that,0.03809041
so you know in this moment you see that she's sort of like they're both,0.021552615
describing just little things that people notice about you that you don't necessarily notice about,0.024432195
yourself and just you know little pleasantries and little nuances like the way you know,0.33592376
your eyes you know when you're intrigued about something you're you know your eyebrows rise,0.071317665
or when you're upset you you know your mouth sort of drops and you don't,0.27096498
know what to do and so just little things like that and i think it,0.03158691
adds to the story and the the overall growth of the passion that you see,0.020612046
later there's a moment when they're all reading it's uh louise mariana and sophie they're,0.022505159
all sitting around a table reading orpheus and eurodice and that they start breaking down,0.064493544
this moment of the story when when orpheus is the they're having an impassioned conversation,0.04248262
uh the these two characters uh the the book is based off and eurodace is,0.020174354
that they're discussing uh a love between the two of them and as uh uh,0.046504986
orpheus leaves uh your eurodice tells him to turn around and so he turns around,0.14642288
and then leaves instead of like it's sort of uh like a a way to,0.056100257
describe the that this character and which when i got to this part of the,0.02434439
the film you see it kind of open up and and things start to make,0.018617826
more sense and the things that i thought earlier in the film when they were,0.026426416
sitting at the beach and uh the idea of the portrait and the ranged marriage,0.032602645
everything like that um and why the portrait wasn't wanting to be done is you,0.046810303
start to see in this book and then the film continues and follows after this,0.011497034
uh sort of kind of like a midway point and you know it it's showing,0.06276673
you that you can either have the choice of the poet and you leave you,0.03079002
know only retaining the memory of what you had rather than you know the choice,0.029209545
of the lover and taking the moment for what it is staying around and you,0.039562464
know either it goes on and you live a great and wonderful life or it,0.09199756
doesn't and you know it buds out and it just is what it is so,0.016954865
in in this the it pretty much encapsulizes the rest of the film so there's,0.053266577
a love story these two uh heloise and mariana they they fall in love um,0.08795391
and they realized that that love can't be after the portrait is completed and that,0.023207592
marianne she chooses to walk away like orpheus did and you know she chose to,0.06744563
take the poet's way out and just have that last memory of happiness rather than,0.015529377
what could have come from their relationship uh especially in the world and at that,0.069163136
time uh who knows how that could have turned out ended up so the sort,0.03441394
of gather everything uh you know that they fall in love it's your you know,0.06934872
it's the story how you see it unfold throughout the film uh you know there's,0.019377464
no i don't think there are any real surprises necessarily uh i i think that,0.02709559
the film writes itself out as it should and as it's supposed to uh a,0.017149765
couple of things in the film i did notice is uh there's a scene which,0.040354695
involves sophie uh she finds out that she's pregnant and i suppose at the the,0.0784797
time that this film is set around if she were found to be you know,0.03824141
an unwed mother she may have lost her job what you know what have you,0.12660107
and been on her own to to try and find out what she needs to,0.056184072
do to to keep going um she winds up going to a local woman and,0.0613
she gets an abortion uh there's a very sad and unique juxtaposition during the scene,0.32415175
um you see it all unfold and take place you know she comes in the,0.027231954
lady lays her down and performs the abortion as it's happening there's a baby next,0.31330413
to her the the woman's child is next to her on the bed and you,0.37216634
see this sort of connection and like she doesn't want to have this abortion but,0.09709153
because of what she's presented with she has no choice and so you see it's,0.060266305
like she's face to face with what she's lost and you see like a a,0.22153343
breakdown of her soul and you know it's it's a very intimate moment um hello,0.19565046
east and mariana they're there uh hello east makes you know marion is trying to,0.035023913
to look away and she's like watch what's happening you know it's you you have,0.035758942
to understand that your choices have actions and you know they may not all be,0.025560347
the best so you know that this is the outcome of the action she chose,0.018154193
to take but it's it's just a very like you get into that scene and,0.09813987
especially when it you know pans in on her and the baby and you know,0.23189619
she's crying just seeing everything it i mean it it sort of breaks you down,0.21505187
in that scene and it's just a very beautiful scene there's uh another scene where,0.049964603
he'll release and mariana are you know it's their last moments together and uh mariana,0.027784055
that she's drawing a portrait of heloise and they discussed like oh you can you,0.075938694
know you'll always have my memory you'll be able to recreate this portrait a thousand,0.04605798
times over just from memory and then she discusses a you know would you draw,0.04748081
something from me and hands her a book and chooses a page in that book,0.10444913
and mariana she draws a self-portrait of her for hallease you know it's just as,0.16985399
a a lasting memory you know something that she can look back to and remember,0.04210546
and then you know that the mother comes everyone gets dressed goes about their separate,0.036091533
ways and then you you have the the final goodbye where marianna she gets paid,0.044718966
for you know performing her duty and completing the portrait uh it's her time to,0.063224375
leave i mean she obviously can't stick around and she has her final rounds of,0.074973516
goodbyes and then she goes there's that final moment where like in the book hello,0.036985543
east runs down the stairs to stop mariana from leaving and she's like turn around,0.09585363
and you know has that whole moment just like in the book um almost verbatim,0.009698378
and mariana leaves you know it cuts out next thing you know um miranda's an,0.032701094
art show and she's showing off uh some of the art that she has done,0.0534342
uh under her father's name uh i you know i guess as a woman back,0.13934733
then you you wouldn't have been able to you know put out your own art,0.073472194
in some cases so she put it under her father's name so it would get,0.043346692
recognized and if anyone asked she would explain that it was her piece while she's,0.04239681
there this is many years later while she's there she sees a portrait on the,0.027521973
wall not her portrait but a portrait of eloise with a daughter so you have,0.1700502
that she sees it and all these emotions come flooding back come flooding through and,0.08795923
she sees that louise is holding a book and it's her finger is holding the,0.089489155
book at the page you see the page number that she's holding it to and,0.047110967
it's the page that she drew that portrait on so it was kind of like,0.05209785
a you know this portrait's going to get out and i want you know if,0.08334618
there's any chance that marianna is going to see this that i want her to,0.048075482
know that i still think about her and so like i thought that was just,0.04528437
kind of like a beautiful nod and she saw it and she was like you,0.120099574
know just reassured that what they had was what she remembers and i i love,0.070460245
that and then lastly the end of this movie it like it sucks you in,0.5767731
it's you know it's the last like 30 seconds to a minute but it like,0.036067586
sucks you in and earlier in the film there's a scene where uh the two,0.6459614
of them are sitting at you know she's trying to explain eloise asks mariana what,0.03976734
orchestra music's like and she can't really explain it but she tries there's a heart,0.045163307
support in the room and she plays this favorite tune of hers a vivaldi tune,0.038222782
uh and you know just kind of talks about the the piece while she's playing,0.044602558
it for her and trying to describe you know what what an orchestra is like,0.029242137
to someone who's never heard one and you know doing her best at the the,0.037234984
this film ends with uh mariana attending an orchestra show and she sees from afar,0.06941258
um she's she's alone mind you um which kind of uh harks back to earlier,0.12745982
in the film with the idea of solitude and doing something just for yourself and,0.030923057
so she's there and she sees off like she notices in the distance a woman,0.15955894
walking and it's heloise she's there by herself doing this in solitude and what i,0.078664616
loved about this is she notices it and and you get the the commentary describing,0.031620834
her entering the you know tour seat in the theater on the balcony like you,0.11749671
you see all this going on and it you like you no longer you're at,0.087827526
this point seeing through the eyes of mariana and as she's looking across at eloise,0.07901983
the the production starts and it zooms in closer and closer and closer to eloise,0.02546057
and you think and this is a another thing i like this i i feel,0.047803424
like if this movie was made in america you would have had her like look,0.057001583
over and like there'd be a like an obvious you know connection of sight and,0.059138816
the movie would have just ended the last 30 seconds of this film is the,0.040976644
music starts it's the vivaldi song that she was showing her earlier in the film,0.04382629
and you just see it zoom in closer and closer slower and slower to heloise,0.030148119
and you see that like all this emotion she realizes what song is she it's,0.049885448
all this emotions flooding back in and you see her like breathing heavier breathing heavier,0.25183037
she's realizing like it's it's that poet moment where she goes back to realizing what,0.052240197
she had in the good time and you see her she starts to cry and,0.10537706
the breathing just starts getting heavier and heavier and then the film ends it's such,0.043145142
a beautiful movie if i had to give this a star rating a solid five,0.04627483
it's just in that last 30 seconds alone an amazing piece of film that that's,0.040734515
definitely going into like i love little nuances like that in film and i feel,0.2045739
like you only get like split seconds of it but this you had 30 seconds,0.10719102
of what was just honest true bold emotion and how somebody by themselves would react,0.022517132
to something like this so i mean definitely like five stars a solid five star,0.040302146
this is a beautiful movie and i do want to watch it again soon and,0.050253958
just just really take the film in um that there's a scene in the film,0.019794535
uh i'm gonna put the the song the link for this song below um but,0.12041487
there's a scene where they go back or they they go out to when sophie's,0.050267264
trying to get you know find out about her pregnancy they go to this they're,0.054262355
