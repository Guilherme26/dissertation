hey everyone its Rihanna and welcome back to another video,0.12090792
so today I am so excited to be talking about giving mo de Torres new film the shape of water which I was highly anticipating Gilliam auditorium is one of my favorite directors working today he brings such new fresh creative ideas at to the film industry and they always bring the original stories which is why I love him,0.03361953
Gilliam Editora has never once let me down as a director,0.2335129
so let's see if the shape of water is as good as his previous films once upon a time during the cold war a mute woman named Eliza played by Sally Hawkins works in a scientific experimental facility and one night they get a new asset in the facility and Eliza goes to investigate and finds a c-like creature who is also very human-like in a pool tank,0.14547321
now Eliza finds a unique connection between her and the sea like creature,0.18134813
the fact that she can't speak in the fact that he can't speak gives her the much-needed communication that she is craved for her whole life,0.108081296
she's always felt alone as a human,0.35563228
and they start to form a friendship,0.10967972
now the first thing that struck me about the shape of water was at the world that Gilliam auditory sets his film in obviously it's set during the Cold War there is tension between the Russians and the Americans and it's a very fantastical world obviously we have a scene like creature living in it and obviously in the real world we would not see that but also the use of colors and music and just overall the whimsical atmosphere of the film it definitely makes it otherworldly but also very much set in our time which is what I've always loved about Gilliam Otara him setting fantastical stories in the real world,0.104725525
it's not such a complicated world that he has to build around it,0.14878654
but it is very very effective,0.06069444
it's a very dark story but it's also filled with bright colors and whimsical music the world is obviously helped out by the production's line and at the cinematography and overall the aesthetic of this film is just beautiful the deep greens and blues that used in this film are just gorgeous,0.073749684
it is very pleasing,0.14535575
to look at I would expect nothing less from giving a model tour,0.067971244
Oh since he makes nothing but beautiful films,0.26516074
so let's get down to the characters of the film our main character is in woman named Eliza,0.12822211
Sally,0.030458387
Hawkins gives a fantastic performance here,0.12031505
she's strong and powerful and emotional just by using her actions obviously she can use her voice in her acting which I found phenomenal,0.22514145
I could really sympathize with and relate to the character of a live out which just is incredible,0.02181002
I really am rooting for her in next year's Oscars because obviously she's mute there's a lot of use of sign language in this film which I really really like it's very rare to see the use of sign language in such a big production of filmic,0.15395434
but I thought it was really really effective considering her and this creature could communicate through sign,0.13675807
language,0.033744674
Michael Shannon plays the bad guy mr.,0.3838365
Strickland who is incredibly scary he's very disturbing and creepy but if anyone can pull that off it's Michael Shannon he has one of those very creepy faces,0.44650066
so we have a powerful performance and a scary performance,0.15170826
but we also have some married comedic performances here especially from a Tobias Spencer who plays the character of Zelda who is Eliza's work colleague she had some of the best lines that she was just hilarious it's very reminiscent of her role in the help her characters are very similar,0.046116684
and another comedic performance was of Richard Jenkins as Eliza's neighbor Giles,0.092668325
I thought he was great in the film I really loved his character all of these characters were so well fleshed out that I just think the writing for them is incredible and obviously as this sealant creature,0.13829015
we have Gilliam Editora alumni Doug Jones who always gives a fantastic performance even if he is under a latex costume him and Sally Hawkins have this really strange connection and they really bring it to the characters,0.089116536
it's just fantastic,0.07974781
I think the film looking so beautiful wasn't enough the creatures line is something sent from the heavens above it looks so real and realistic it is in competition with things like the Apes in the Planet of the Apes trilogy,0.24242878
I really do think Hollywood need to learn a thing or two from Guillermo de Torres creature design because when he did the big-budget blockbuster film Pacific Rim the design of the kaiju sand the jaegers were incredible and let's just face it things like transformers pirates the Caribbean anything that involves a big huge monster thing needs to step up the game if they want to compete with Guillermo de Toro with any other Gillian motor Tori films this story is one the bazaar,0.21516483
it's quite light-hearted compared to his other films especially Pan's Labyrinth which I think there's definitely a similarity between the two because it is set in the real world in a real time but the shape of water just has something very whimsical about it,0.07579604
I keep using that word but it is very very true,0.05105656
because the film is light-hearted and funny but also incredibly dark,0.08551113
I think the film kind of struggled with its tone considering there are,0.033317793
so many genres here we have fantasy comedy kind of thriller horror elements in here at the end of the film somehow Gilliam auditoria has worked his director magic and weave them together perfectly Gilliam,0.09189567
auditorio,0.02527139
I just am so in or of him,0.106055886
he is such a fantastic director he can do no wrong in my eyes the shape of water is another fantastic film by him,0.12559028
I can't wait to see what he does next,0.11140643
I seriously think this is Guillermo de Torres best film it's since Pan's Labyrinth and I cannot wait to see it again,0.093926825
although I will not be seeing again till February next year because that's when it's officially released in the UK,0.08761178
oh that makes it sound like I illegally watched it which I absolutely didn't I saw it at the BFI London Film Festival and people clapped after and usually I would never clap after a film but I had to clap for this it's definitely a cinematic experience Gillian wonder toy fans are going to love it,0.07858551
it's not gonna be a film for everyone,0.08920391
it is quite bizarre and odd but I absolutely loved it definitely go see it,0.097730696
