hey guys so today I am going to be talking about Thor Ragnarok the new,0.102927946
addition to the MCU franchise I'm excited for this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it,0.09075349
so let's just talk all things this is a non spoiler like all of my,0.14197128
refuse there's no spoiler so don't worry because I know it hasn't come out in,0.07281838
the US yet and like many other countries so I guess just get straight into,0.11599364
it personally I'm gonna start off with the characters I thought they did a fantastic,0.11995337
job with the characters in this film with new additions and also coming back to,0.086102135
a lot of characters we already know and a style off with Thor Chris Hemsworth,0.057625394
is such a hilarious guy in real life and I feel like Thor has had,0.1612491
that he's kind of had this sort of fish-out-of-water sort of thing of about him,0.19290698
throughout the franchise since event the Avengers so I've been kind of waiting for them,0.06815488
to take this direction with him and I'm really happy that they did that they,0.079462156
embraced his humorous side I think they did that really really well with his character,0.06852009
so that really pleased me and Chris Hemsworth is Thor like I don't picture anyone,0.19234286
else as Thor so I think it was fantastic again also the Hulk the Hulk,0.08152883
I was actually really excited for in this movie because we don't get much of,0.09880804
him in the previous film so I was like okay what's it going to be,0.09655478
like and I think this is probably the best version of the Hulk we have,0.06898711
gotten because we've seen so much of Bruce Banner and there isn't as much of,0.063421965
him in this film as in Bruce whenever he is on screen majority of the,0.06259259
time it's the Hulk which I was happy with because I wanted to see that,0.061221145
other side to him and I think the banter back and forth and the friendship,0.077150166
relationship between Thor and Hulk was just absolutely perfect they worked so well off each,0.045810018
other I think they're different humor just reflecting each other and it just it worked,0.072971195
then we have Halle who is played by Kate Blanchet fellow Aussie and I was,0.14403631
excited for her as a villain because you know she looked like this serious like,0.34850335
villainous woman that was gonna be like real strong and everything and I was just,0.16208534
like can't wait to see her and she was a total badass I just loved,0.48800328
her look her style and aesthetic just looked perfect I loved her whole costume and,0.15470105
everything awesome she's kind of like this femme fatale sort of feeling to her I,0.19061023
really enjoyed her character but she's not my favorite villain she wasn't in it as,0.2409839
much as I thought she would be but also like just in the scale of,0.11388047
villains she's not up there up there with me I don't know why she just,0.44342643
didn't she was good she was a good villain but she wasn't like my favorite,0.29250553
of all the time like it won't be lucky sorry sorry lucky he has the,0.0832019
top notch he's he's up this Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson another awesome kick-ass female,0.8302642
character I thought she was a great addition to the team but I just want,0.048986517
to go straight on to one of my favorite characters of this film and another,0.10657298
standout Loki Tom Hiddleston just his character as Loki is absolutely perfect every single time,0.06557021
he is fantastic I love his character he's such a complex character that has had,0.051167723
lots of time throughout this franchise to expand and flesh out his character so seeing,0.08326749
him in this film you see even more of that especially his relationship with Thor,0.11001284
you get a lot of those sort of moments as character moments between the two,0.0655284
of them which I really liked seeing their dynamic again because he's not a good,0.3512079
guy and he's not like an evil guy he's like that in-between and I love,0.4662099
how they balance out his character in that way considering the direction that Marvel wanted,0.12354098
to take with this movie I think Tiger OTD was an absolutely perfect choice the,0.13749108
director for this film I think he was fantastic I love his style and I,0.09260437
think that he works so well with the tone of this of this film overall,0.1195388
the comedy hilarious the writing and the dialogue was just outstanding when it came to,0.08913766
the humor each character had its own their own sort of take on it which,0.07905712
I thought was really good and I was laughed out loud the whole cinema was,0.07116342
just like enjoying it so much and it was a great atmosphere to be in,0.071735635
I think Tiger bootys comedic style really stood out in this movie and wasn't like,0.2419011
immature childish humor it's very smart intelligent humor which I really liked the comedy wasn't,0.3835671
you know sort of toilet humor or anything like that it wasn't kiddush it didn't,0.34650502
like bring down any of the comedy or anything like that so I think that,0.18935183
tiger TT just nailed that criteria section of a Marvel movie the balance between fantasy,0.14875995
in action with comedy comedy as well as sort of character moments I thought was,0.101508625
really good I enjoyed that it wasn't it wasn't like a typical and Cu movie,0.15793404
I mean most of them alike you have a lot of action and a lot,0.10777287
of stuff between all the characters and sort of jokes sprinkled throughout the film whereas,0.041254785
this one the action wasn't as prominent the action wasn't like a big spectacle there,0.10088086
are a couple of scenes that were standout moments which were awesome but then the,0.045718674
rest of it there wasn't a lot of action to go from so don't expect,0.08705722
it to be nonstop action from what we did get in the action scenes I,0.050898504
think was great because it showed off how powerful these characters are Thor and Hulk,0.05885987
I don't think you get to see as much of how powerful they are I,0.117112674
mean thought is a God and you kind of forget how strong they are when,0.08579343
they're with the other Avengers because you have to pay so much attention to the,0.08415288
other characters the CGI and green-screen um Hulk was probably the best most well done,0.024226647
CG aspect to the film I think he looks so realistic but there were definitely,0.06289466
obvious moments where as a little messy green-screen was like it wasn't up to par,0.1136787
and the special effects just wasn't what I wanted and what I would expect so,0.07370557
I was a bit disappointed in that aspect how it fits into the MCU it,0.15930356
is definitely more of a standalone film it has subtle connections to the rest of,0.09008
the franchise obviously but its style and how Tiger BTT was able to implement his,0.14212663
own style I'd have a little bit more freedom and flexibility I think makes it,0.14764622
stand out from others so it's definitely part of the MCU no way is it,0.09212586
just like its own movie it's not part of it but it definitely has its,0.06594069
own thing going on so unlike so there was something a little different but you,0.13755825
still have that and see you feel to it so if you're into superhero movies,0.10510391
it's definitely still a superhero movie and there are some subtle cameos just put it,0.063152514
out there so keep your eye out so before I see big movies like these,0.14902595
I don't watch any reviews I don't read any I don't look at readings it,0.0783913
weeks nothing until I see it so I didn't do that before this movie I,0.080352746
didn't know I heard heard that it was getting positive stuff but I didn't know,0.05540742
anything in depth no spoilers nothing so that's why I didn't want to do a,0.05700201
spoiler review for all of you guys because I that hasn't come out everywhere so,0.12345652
don't judge the film from just reviews that you've seen go in enjoy it hopefully,0.066895515
you liked it hopefully you enjoy the comedy because there is a lot in this,0.1326632
film if you have seen the film let me know what you think hope you,0.109507546
