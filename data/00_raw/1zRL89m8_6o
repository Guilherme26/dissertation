oh god [Music] [Laughter] seven samurai is a film that came out in 1954 and is written and directed by akira kurusawa so this is actually a film request from a 50 patron that you guys might know by the name of cynic the critic in the comments section and he's been a longtime subscriber of mine and i really appreciate him a lot and his channel is actually filled with reviews and ranked videos he specifically came out recently with a stanley kubrick rank video that even though i have my disagreements with him and he knows what they are in terms of the ranking um it's actually a really well thought out video really fleshed out and you could tell that he put a lot of time and effort and what he wanted to say about these films and how you want to describe certain things so i would highly suggest checking that video out specifically but really check out his whole channel but anyway let me just make a quick shameful confession i have actually never seen an akira kurosawa film before i know that's like kino blasphemy i've heard about him for a very long time at least two or three years now i just never got around to diving into his work and really exploring him as a filmmaker which is why i was really excited when cynic requested for me to watch this film because if i'm not mistaken 7 samurai is one of his most iconic and most popular works that is pretty much loved by everybody and some even go as far as saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made and now that i've finally seen this film i completely understand why so many people love this film and give it the high praise that they do i really enjoyed this film and i really admired a lot about it despite its three hour and a half run time yes this film is three hours and a half long which was kind of concerning going into it because nobody wants to sit through a three hour and a half film that they don't end up liking very much but luckily that wasn't the case at all and honestly this is one of those films that are so entertaining and character-rich that it really could have been five hours long and i could probably sit through it and it wouldn't bother me at all and it's actually quite astonishing because this film's premise and plotline is actually incredibly simplistic and there's not really much to it it's essentially just about these village farmers who are under attack by these bandits and they basically just go out and try to recruit a group of samurai that can really help protect them and their crops so you really wouldn't expect a film that has that simple of a plot to have over a three hour run time but where this film exceeds is just how incredibly rich all these characters are and i really do mean all of the characters because don't get me wrong i love the samurai characters and yes they are the most engaging part of the film obviously but even the village farmer characters are actually quite memorable and stand out with their own personalities and all kind of have their own arcs conflicts and flaws and that's something that i've definitely noticed about a lot of korean and japanese filmmaking is that they turn out to be quite character heavy and that's something that is just really fun to look forward to when i go into a film like this and to me seven samurai is the ultimate master class in character writing where not a single character feels underwritten or underdeveloped and my personal favorite samurai character in this film which is probably a lot of people's favorite samurai character in this film was uh kikichiro i think is how you pronounce it he basically is like the unofficial drunken samurai in this film and i thought his character was just like super entertaining and it was really interesting to see how his character unfolded throughout the film but one neat thing that i personally noticed while i was watching this film was that there is no way that quentin tarantino isn't deeply inspired by akira kurosawa films or at least old classic japanese films in general because um not only is the strong emphasis on character really apparent but even down to like the music choices and how they're used throughout the film just had this classic heroic sound to it that reminded me a lot of the same way that quentin tarantino would use in his films and there's also this comedic element to the film as well which i found quite surprising because i really didn't expect to laugh at this film as much as i did and it just has this silly admirable charm about it that isn't like too outrageous to the point where it'll take you out of the drama when it happens because this film balances comedy and drama incredibly well the film has this constant incorporation and blending of both genres throughout the film that never really took you out of the overall mood and never made it to where like you couldn't take the dramatic aspect seriously and the film didn't make you feel uncomfortable to where you couldn't laugh at the silly comedic stuff because it's not it didn't feel like it was choppy or jarring it just had this really smooth blend throughout the film which again is something that strongly insisted that tarantino was deeply inspired by this film and other stuff like this but what this film builds up to in the third act is quite astonishing considering how ambitious it is with the scope of these giant action sequences because essentially the third act of this film is just non-stop action but it's action that contains actual heart and substance to it that made me feel a whole lot more invested in it because you felt this genuine stakes for the characters when they were going through moments of peril but even on top of that there is just a lot going on with the amount of stunt work and coordination going on with these action sequences because there are tons of people on horseback and there's just horses falling over and people falling over and i'm i'm pretty sure horses got injured during this which is kind of sad but just what it took to achieve what was occurring on screen with that kind of magnitude is quite astonishing especially for something in the 1950s because to be honest none of the stunt work in this film and none of the action in here feels dated or cheesy and you would think that for something that was made in the early 1950s that there would be some element of datedness or cheesiness to it but it's not like it's all very believable it's all incredibly convincing and for seven samurai to be able to achieve something like that over 70 years ago is really impressive and it's something about the film that i truly admire and one thing that i just thought was really cool and funny about the making of this film which is something that i have to give cynic credit for because he's the one that informed me about it is that apparently um akira kudosawa went over budget multiple times during the making of this film and then when the producers were were hounding him about it and basically telling them that like we're not gonna invest money into you anymore he would just be like okay and then he would just dip and then he would go fishing and which already is just like my kind of guy because i love fishing but like eventually the the producers would be like okay fine just just here just just take the money god damn it and that apparently happened multiple times throughout production and i just think that's a really badass and hilarious fact i thought was slightly bothersome when i was watching it and it's just the fact that some of the writing throughout this film came off just incredibly on the nose like in terms of the dialogue like there would be a handful of moments in this film where something would already be pretty clear to the audience whether it was shown visually or it was something that was demonstrated to through more clever writing and then there would be like another type of character that would ask an obvious question just to reassure that what was happening was really happening and there were moments like that throughout this film that i was like damn like why why do filmmakers feel like the audience just won't get something and maybe they're right but some of this stuff was just really really obvious and it just seemed like why would you take away from how beautifully you were able to craft that and convey that information by just forcibly inserting dialogue that just double reassured to the audience what was happening and i just didn't like that aspect of the film but it's a really really minor aspect and most of the dialogue they're writing is really well done it's just they were just little moments sprinkled throughout the film that would kind of have that element to it i'm actually going to go ahead and give a quick example of what i'm talking about because i just think for a film like this it's important for me to actually demonstrate what i mean so if you haven't seen the film yet i suggest covering your ears for the next 30 seconds to a minute i'll make sure to put a spoiler tab up top so you know when it's over but um this is what i'm talking about so when you have this great scene where uh kikichiro gives his rant this really angry soulful rant um where he's kind of chewing out all the samurai and how they're judging and viewing these farmers it was just an excellent scene like everything about it really came together and again what's so great about it is that it was able to tell you a lot about his character in the sense that he came from a farming village himself and he was raised a farmer and you know you didn't need any character to reassure that in order for someone to understand it but yet after we get that excellent scene where he just goes on this rant you have the other main samurai the film basically ask this really obvious question where he's like and it was just little moments like that that happened throughout the film that would be bothersome to me because it's it's kind of heartbreaking sometimes to see something be so excellently portrayed and then um kind of diluted a little bit by having something like that in it but again it's it's a really minor criticism it's not something that really dragged the film down for me at all but it was something that was noticeable when i was watching it because overall i still think that this is a [ __ ] magnificent film especially for something that was created in the early 1950s and this is something that i actually love like i actually love this film regardless of that flaw and it's something that i really really want to buy on criterion i heard this is like the second criteria never made which is really interesting i'm gonna buy the hell out of that in the next november sale so i'm going to give seven samurai a nine out of ten [Applause] one thing that i forgot to mention about this film is that the camera work and the lighting in this film is just immaculate like there are some shots in this film that i was just in awe by because i was like that is a beautiful shot how the hell were you able to frighten that so perfectly especially like it just seems like something that is so incredibly ahead of its time and um for those who follow the channel you know that i love me some brilliant aesthetic work and this film has some brilliant aesthetic work so that was something that i really admired about the film as well but anyway i hope you enjoyed what i had to say about seven samurai if you really enjoyed this video please give this video a thumbs up and
