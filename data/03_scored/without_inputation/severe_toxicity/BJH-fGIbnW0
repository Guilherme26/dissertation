hi everyone and welcome back to roll the credit my name is Hana and this,0.01405134
is a channel for everyone who's interested in film TV and pop culture today we,0.026065886
are gonna be talking about a play that is currently running at the null coward,0.16384271
theater in London and it is all about Eve starring Julie Madison and Lily James,0.01861716
in the main roles I saw this performance about two weeks ago now for my,0.030366298
birthday and I was actually quite surprised how good it was and I'm someone who,0.034863606
doesn't really go to the theater a lot but I love love love Gillian Anderson,0.057020873
so it was a guaranteed success for me and I'm just really happy that it,0.019174583
didn't disappoint me because sometimes when you have a favorite actress or after a director,0.035544753
and you watch something that's a little bit different to what you've seen them in,0.041322537
before sometimes you do end up getting a little bit disappointed but Gillian Anderson is,0.042104796
a master at theater she is absolutely stunning when she's on stage and doing her,0.12706138
thing I have previously seen her in streetcar named desire but I saw their like,0.038685087
national theater and live performance and not actually saw it in the theater and she,0.04722405
is amazing so we're gonna talk a little bit about Gillian understood and her amazingness,0.07621142
and also discussing obviously the entire play and the ensemble and just the scenography and,0.039328318
everything about All About Eve before I get going to that if you do enjoy,0.020717144
this video and you want to see more of my reviews and live reactions to,0.059245247
watching TV series of films for the first time then make sure that you hit,0.10587329
the subscribe button down below and if you do enjoy this video make sure you,0.14748119
give it a thumbs up so yeah let's get into discussing all of my Eve,0.04284847
so I can't wait into this play and performance only knowing that it was about,0.029395796
this woman and her understudy that was all I knew and that is pretty much,0.21679798
what the play is about so it is called All About Eve and Eve is,0.007849832
played by Lily James and she he comes into the life of Margo I can't,0.032450985
remember her last name Margo Channing she comes into life on Margo Channing who is,0.041651804
a Broadway star and a sensation she comes in to her life after one of,0.026835503
her performances Eve has been standing at the stage door and has been to every,0.06055699
single performance that Margo has done and she starts telling her the story about her,0.020463044
life on how she aspires to be Margo and it just it kind of takes,0.08018589
on from there Margaret kind of takes eat under her wing and lets her come,0.090490915
into her home she stays in her house and comes to the theatre with her,0.040468443
to work there and eventually she becomes Margo's understudy so in the beginning you kind,0.0468123
of just feel that okay Eve is a huge fan of Margo and she just,0.040987287
aspires to be a good as good of an actress that Margo is the further,0.050681006
along in the play get the weirder it starts getting Michael has a boyfriend who,0.02778073
is a lot younger than her and Margo is actually in her like prime years,0.017033357
so she is getting a little bit too old or she feels that she's getting,0.14012226
too old in her world or in her like in her career and uh seeing,0.076599225
Eve coming up and kind of flirting with her boyfriend she does get a very,0.088553905
very insecure and when her boyfriend comes back from a gasps la they throw a,0.16837926
big birthday slash welcome home party for him and it's just a very odd situation,0.061741017
because they have all these friends and family over but Margo just doesn't really spend,0.022104718
time with him she gets meeting any junk and she doesn't like the life that,0.35470605
has become of her since Eve entered her life and I think that is pretty,0.10913668
much the main trigger for her look since Eve came in and started becoming like,0.050663713
more and more attached to her and starting to take a bigger role in her,0.04377507
life or in the lives of the people around Margo she starts feeling very very,0.078656636
insecure and eventually just spirals and she doesn't really trust anyone and she sees how,0.07203141
Eve just takes and takes and takes more of what is Margo's life and she,0.02522975
starts to and doubt the people around her and also doubt herself in who she,0.03424565
is now I'm terrible I remember things that happened while I watched them so that,0.021513369
is pretty much the like rundown of the story all about each is based on,0.03872433
the film that was all about Eve back in the day I think it's like,0.02318564
from the 60s we're gonna read a little quickly from Wikipedia yeah so let you,0.02530026
it is pretty much what I said Margo Channing is a highly regarded but aging,0.040252257
Broadway star and Eve Harrington is an ambitious young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's,0.019102745
life ultimately threatening Chinese career and her personal relationship and I just felt that I,0.14811312
don't want to give anything away from people who haven't like watched the previous film,0.041983064
or read the script or anything like I don't want to spoil the ending but,0.020479674
such a good ending I just thought it was like the perfect theater ending in,0.14203998
a way because I don't really like with theater ends and like a happy like,0.03152638
a happy ending you usually doesn't it is usually like it leaves you sat there,0.07170879
and received with something to think about and this play definitely definitely definitely leaves you,0.024182752
tons to think about before I get into my praise for Gillian Anderson I just,0.1224031
want to talk about the scenography and the production design of this because it was,0.02611644
a little bit different from any other theatre performance I've ever seen I think the,0.0425957
only other play or like adoption of a play I've ever seen I was very,0.010876418
different was 1984 that I saw in Cardiff once and I just having read the,0.026068548
book and seen the film seeing it on stage was just such a contrast and,0.011903461
it was a very minimalistic performance in that way and and all about II was,0.018398315
very interestingly like placed so so the stage looks pretty much like a room we,0.036746074
open up and it's an empty room it's got three walls so obviously we are,0.026652578
the fourth wall as always and eventually once the first opening like monologue is finished,0.05123311
all the walls come up and we get to see there's a door at the,0.03284211
end and on the Left there's something that looks like and there's a door there,0.0543016
too and then there's a door on the right side the walls hug dog come,0.06329422
up now become video screens which I thought was very very interesting and it took,0.04273938
me a little while to understand what was happening because I was very confused essentially,0.028272301
the video screams allows the audience to see what is happening in other parts of,0.07159372
the play the main stage is either her dressing room or her apartment and by,0.017426481
her I mean Margo's in the back is the bathroom and on the left is,0.047550652
a kitchen slash like entryway so during the big party when her boyfriend comes home,0.115823776
there's a lot of action going on in the kitchen so everyone's hanging out in,0.18763301
the kitchen drinking while all the action is happening on the main stage but then,0.043606114
there's also action happening in the bathroom there's a scene that I completely missed which,0.024389623
are very excited to see when I go back to watching it for closing night,0.0522535
but literally the entire cast is on the main stage and for some reason everyone,0.026258789
was laughing I couldn't figure out what everyone was laughing but in on the big,0.024991615
screen we see Margo in the bathtub she is wasted out of her mind and,0.11599539
on the big screens they show Margo in the back in the bathroom like falling,0.049907397
into the bathtub doctors added another dimension to what is usually seen in a theater,0.03245564
and I just thought that was quite a clever way of allowing the stage to,0.02904591
be extended in that way and also incorporating a little bit more video they also,0.060637478
used it in a fantastic way by by putting a camera in the mirror that,0.06876402
she has in her dressing room so when she's like looking at herself and being,0.056082964
like oh my god I'm old blown up on a big screen on the stage,0.105126955
and we get to see like up close and personal with her and then just,0.04797637
like it adds a little bit more dimension to a stage play and I thought,0.037824336
that was quite clever yeah I thought that was quite a clever way and a,0.026711114
nice touch as someone who very very very infrequently visits the theatre I also liked,0.058949906
this set design and how it was all one color so the bed and the,0.2143122
sofa and carpet and the walls they were all the same shade of like a,0.050898522
dark pinkish burning me color I just like when it's simplistic I like when they,0.35902748
don't try to add too much and like just lets the story tell itself but,0.012790151
I also liked how it opened up to everything that was backstage that that also,0.035746302
like the backstage area was a character of itself and that just really interests me,0.026281405
a lot if we go into the acting it was just like an all-around stellar,0.04635399
cast I don't think that anyone really disappointed me I am gonna talk a little,0.037354052
bit ma'am I am gonna talk a little bit about Lilly James I'm probably not,0.038754266
her biggest fan and I haven't really seen her in a bunch I'm literally just,0.09587824
seen her in Mamma Mia I wasn't the biggest fan of her performance in this,0.035589322
show I just felt that she was kind of bland but it could just be,0.18698777
that her character's not very interesting even though the play is called All About Eve,0.019817816
it's literally all about Margo and I don't know maybe that is like if without,0.026106462
giving away the ending maybe Margo was the same person Eve was what she was,0.043795027
young and she went to the theater and she saw this big star and then,0.028892918
she became her understudy and kind of took over her life I don't know maybe,0.10283074
that is what that is maybe why it's called All About Eve but it's literally,0.013656885
not All About Eve and I'm quite happy that Margo has the biggest role and,0.015701659
that Julie Anderson actually gets to like thrive in her role as Margo Channing because,0.04630942
it's just like it's such a stunning role and Gillian Anderson is as I said,0.08175972
amazing in this role and I'm so happy that she took on this task I,0.029934594
am very excited to go back to the null character and see it on closing,0.097239874
night because it is possibly one of the best plays I've ever seen and I,0.020928673
haven't seen a lot and it isn't just because Jillian Addison's fantastic in it the,0.011722531
entire cast is fantastic writing is very witty and I loved the stage setup even,0.039890397
though in the beginning I was very confused and kind of didn't like it it,0.018813388
was fantastic now that I think about a little bit more Eva Von Hoff just,0.045773946
like did a really good job in directing the ensemble like everyone had something to,0.05502266
do with all times and the people in the back while things were happening mainstage,0.03472658
the people are in the kitchen they were going full out and it was really,0.07332586
very impressive just to see like it created the life of a party even though,0.05652398
the party was in the back room and on the main room the party wasn't,0.027105568
really there it just added so much dimension to the play I also kind of,0.012255344
joy when they do break the fourth wall and they do break the fourth wall,0.13298817
quite a couple of times in this play there is a lot of talking to,0.022671454
the audience but it's more like the audience of the theater that they're doing I,0.013827838
can't remember which character or what significance her KarenT has I think she's like Margo's,0.052022684
manager or something like that and or the producer she talks directly to the audience,0.043973297
kind of updating us on what's going on and what's happening it kind of like,0.021899842
Annie's way in in a sense and I did quite enjoy that I do enjoy,0.036393527
when they break the fourth wall and through that making the audience feel like they,0.036429446
are the audience like they're just spectators they're not part of the play they're just,0.019262388
spectators and but still being able to address the audience in that way if that,0.012747579
makes any sense I don't even know I said but I think that made sense,0.036555167
anyway yeah Judy Madsen is fantastic she was just nominated for an over here all,0.103273086
olivia.olivia award I can say that so I'm very excited to see that all of,0.02778206
you your oliviere awards I'm definitely not a theater person as you can tell so,0.15310931
I'm very excited to see that and I have my fingers crossed for Jillian Addison,0.039918337
because she is stunning and as much as I love everything that she does I,0.08369008
want her to do more theater stuff and also more comedies so imagine her doing,0.12087052
a comedy play that would just be amazing so that is my review and my,0.033645652
thoughts about Oliver Eve that you can catch at the mill coward theater right here,0.16273917
