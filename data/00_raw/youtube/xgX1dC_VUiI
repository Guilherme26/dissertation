hey guys so today I am going to be talking about Thor Ragnarok the new addition to the MCU franchise I'm excited for this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it so let's just talk all things this is a non spoiler like all of my refuse there's no spoiler so don't worry because I know it hasn't come out in the US yet and like many other countries so I guess just get straight into it personally I'm gonna start off with the characters I thought they did a fantastic job with the characters in this film with new additions and also coming back to a lot of characters we already know and a style off with Thor Chris Hemsworth is such a hilarious guy in real life and I feel like Thor has had that he's kind of had this sort of fish-out-of-water sort of thing of about him throughout the franchise since event the Avengers so I've been kind of waiting for them to take this direction with him and I'm really happy that they did that they embraced his humorous side I think they did that really really well with his character so that really pleased me and Chris Hemsworth is Thor like I don't picture anyone else as Thor so I think it was fantastic again also the Hulk the Hulk I was actually really excited for in this movie because we don't get much of him in the previous film so I was like okay what's it going to be like and I think this is probably the best version of the Hulk we have gotten because we've seen so much of Bruce Banner and there isn't as much of him in this film as in Bruce whenever he is on screen majority of the time it's the Hulk which I was happy with because I wanted to see that other side to him and I think the banter back and forth and the friendship relationship between Thor and Hulk was just absolutely perfect they worked so well off each other I think they're different humor just reflecting each other and it just it worked then we have Halle who is played by Kate Blanchet fellow Aussie and I was excited for her as a villain because you know she looked like this serious like villainous woman that was gonna be like real strong and everything and I was just like can't wait to see her and she was a total badass I just loved her look her style and aesthetic just looked perfect I loved her whole costume and everything awesome she's kind of like this femme fatale sort of feeling to her I really enjoyed her character but she's not my favorite villain she wasn't in it as much as I thought she would be but also like just in the scale of villains she's not up there up there with me I don't know why she just didn't she was good she was a good villain but she wasn't like my favorite of all the time like it won't be lucky sorry sorry lucky he has the top notch he's he's up this Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson another awesome kick-ass female character I thought she was a great addition to the team but I just want to go straight on to one of my favorite characters of this film and another standout Loki Tom Hiddleston just his character as Loki is absolutely perfect every single time he is fantastic I love his character he's such a complex character that has had lots of time throughout this franchise to expand and flesh out his character so seeing him in this film you see even more of that especially his relationship with Thor you get a lot of those sort of moments as character moments between the two of them which I really liked seeing their dynamic again because he's not a good guy and he's not like an evil guy he's like that in-between and I love how they balance out his character in that way considering the direction that Marvel wanted to take with this movie I think Tiger OTD was an absolutely perfect choice the director for this film I think he was fantastic I love his style and I think that he works so well with the tone of this of this film overall the comedy hilarious the writing and the dialogue was just outstanding when it came to the humor each character had its own their own sort of take on it which I thought was really good and I was laughed out loud the whole cinema was just like enjoying it so much and it was a great atmosphere to be in I think Tiger bootys comedic style really stood out in this movie and wasn't like immature childish humor it's very smart intelligent humor which I really liked the comedy wasn't you know sort of toilet humor or anything like that it wasn't kiddush it didn't like bring down any of the comedy or anything like that so I think that tiger TT just nailed that criteria section of a Marvel movie the balance between fantasy in action with comedy comedy as well as sort of character moments I thought was really good I enjoyed that it wasn't it wasn't like a typical and Cu movie I mean most of them alike you have a lot of action and a lot of stuff between all the characters and sort of jokes sprinkled throughout the film whereas this one the action wasn't as prominent the action wasn't like a big spectacle there are a couple of scenes that were standout moments which were awesome but then the rest of it there wasn't a lot of action to go from so don't expect it to be nonstop action from what we did get in the action scenes I think was great because it showed off how powerful these characters are Thor and Hulk I don't think you get to see as much of how powerful they are I mean thought is a God and you kind of forget how strong they are when they're with the other Avengers because you have to pay so much attention to the other characters the CGI and green-screen um Hulk was probably the best most well done CG aspect to the film I think he looks so realistic but there were definitely obvious moments where as a little messy green-screen was like it wasn't up to par and the special effects just wasn't what I wanted and what I would expect so I was a bit disappointed in that aspect how it fits into the MCU it is definitely more of a standalone film it has subtle connections to the rest of the franchise obviously but its style and how Tiger BTT was able to implement his own style I'd have a little bit more freedom and flexibility I think makes it stand out from others so it's definitely part of the MCU no way is it just like its own movie it's not part of it but it definitely has its own thing going on so unlike so there was something a little different but you still have that and see you feel to it so if you're into superhero movies it's definitely still a superhero movie and there are some subtle cameos just put it out there so keep your eye out so before I see big movies like these I don't watch any reviews I don't read any I don't look at readings it weeks nothing until I see it so I didn't do that before this movie I didn't know I heard heard that it was getting positive stuff but I didn't know anything in depth no spoilers nothing so that's why I didn't want to do a spoiler review for all of you guys because I that hasn't come out everywhere so don't judge the film from just reviews that you've seen go in enjoy it hopefully you liked it hopefully you enjoy the comedy because there is a lot in this film if you have seen the film let me know what you think hope you guys enjoy it and I'll talk to you guys later [Music]
