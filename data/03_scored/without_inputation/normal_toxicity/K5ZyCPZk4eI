yeah sorry man get out yo,0.24844585
I really do not want to spoil this movie,0.10627536
i'ma,0.019852988
try my best to not give away too much,0.15002291
but y'all know I had to do a review on this movie I went and saw get out which is a movie written and directed by Jordan Peele and if you guys are familiar with who he is he's an actor and comedian he's most known for his show key and Peele which is like funny is oh now after seeing this movie twice I saw once with a group of people and I went to see it again by myself I just knew that I was gonna have to come on here and talk to you guys about this movie when I first saw the preview of this movie I was super skeptical one because I mean it was a black guy,0.34967548
he loved black people are in scary movies and definitely not the lead and when they are you know they in like two seconds,0.5887181
and I was also skeptical because it said from the mind of Jordan Peele who's known for you know for comedy,0.09669169
I saw that cat movie and if I mean it was funny but it was just like pure ridiculousness,0.672724
so I was really curious about how he was gonna jump from comedy into into like suspense thriller horror and for anyone who knows me like I love scary movies like horror thriller suspense is my favorite genre of movies so I didn't really I didn't really see the connection between him,0.13269162
and this genre movies but I went to go and see it anyways I'm gonna start by saying that this movie was both hilarious and terrifying and it was a hilarious in the sense that I felt like I was watching a comedy there was just a bit more comic relief than your average horror flick and it wasn't terrifying in that it was scary,0.1723682
it was just there were parts that make you jump,0.10275654
and this movie just made you feel so uneasy like I was in that theater stressed out like I was on the edge of my seat the whole time this just the emotions this movie brought out of me was just befuddling is funneling a word,0.10905906
but fettle funnily whatever but it is very clear that this movie is meant to be a thriller and not a comedy and honestly how this movie got made and passed through Hollywood,0.10154277
I have no idea but I'm gonna break it down for you guys,0.31583127
and tell you what I liked about it,0.0685768
and what I didn't like,0.07150213
now the first thing that I liked about the movie is that it opened up playing redbone by childish gambino like I love that song but the reason why I feel like this is important isn't just because like Oh much movie with song at like no,0.15372486
there's a lot of movies with music,0.036690254
I like this song,0.08529717
and this album in particular like it really gives you the feel of blackness that sounds probably really weird for me to say it sets the tone and it sets the vibe,0.2887545
the only reason I'm saying this is important is because the way he interacted with the other black Pete I'm try not to give away too much,0.44408774
but the way he interacted with the other black people in the movie like it,0.5580362
just gives you a certain feeling,0.1062379
and when you watch this movie you'll know what I mean I also liked the imagery the cinematography,0.17661285
it was very well shot,0.29280493
the shot angles the color,0.26645312
palettes was really really good um the way it was filmed,0.07411471
it was there was a lot of like symbolic shots within the movie a lot of nods to like older horror flicks which I thought was really really cool the performances were really really good especially Chris the main character and his real name is Daniel a poop,0.4437422
I don't know I'm sorry sorry his performance was really really good like he really captured the feeling that I feel like most people especially the black audiences I have to keep going back to black people but me with this move you kind of have to but he really captured the same feeling that we were feeling there were times in the movie where I was like this is crazy,0.52652013
I think he would literally be like,0.07954569
this is crazy,0.34931758
you feel me,0.10306812
so he really captured the feel of how I feel like most people would react if they were in that situation the best thing about this movie is the plot it is the writing like Jordan Peele nailed the out of this movie like he did such a good job the way he wrote this in the way he went about it was very very special like I'm gonna go,0.10809983
I'm gonna go into that a little bit later,0.31089434
but the reason why I'm putting emphases on the writing when you watch scary movies if you're someone who genuinely loves scary movies you know that scary movies for the past like decade have been asked for the most part that's partially because the writing is so trash,0.6297062
they think if a nut stuff pops out at you,0.46370196
and there's enough creepy sounds and the actors can look scared enough that it's a scary movie and a lot of people,0.23983687
buy into that that like Paranormal Activity cameras moving doors shut that is,0.3275369
it's not scary,0.07994148
the only good scary movie,0.12767324
I've seen recently that like automatically pops up off the top of my head is insidious,0.15564935
and ironically the producers from insidious were on this movie to the fact that the plot was so enticing is what helps make a scary movie scary or at least entertaining running away from the deal with a knife and door shutting by itself is not scary,0.099688135
the fact that you got comedians out here making better scary movies than scary movie people yeah study game up,0.2234913
now the next thing that I absolutely loved was low-res character Laura as a comedian his name in the movie was rot,0.29568842
and what I loved about his character was he gave a voice to every black person who's ever watched a scary movie literally everything he was saying in the movie is what we say when we watch scary movies and it was just refreshing to actually see a voice of reason in a scary movie scene on scary movies everybody are like they're all idiots,0.84898406
and it's probably why black people are never in scary movies or they kill us in like the first two minutes,0.69542736
because we don't put ourselves in these situation,0.07139618
we don't chase demons with video,0.27175635
cameras,0.076121874
if we hear a creepy noise we don't investigate,0.113072045
we don't buy dolls from the 1800s,0.06836536
we don't do that let's split a bullet and if we're running we don't fall,0.27797997
now what I didn't like about this movie was I honestly can't think of anything,0.12098061
I dislike about this movie I'm not saying it's the perfect film or whatever,0.14820954
but I really don't have any complaints like I think this movie was really well done,0.08793429
there are some things that were in the trailer and on the movie poster that weren't in the actual movie or that didn't quite like connect in the trailer,0.035735432
there was like this deer skeleton thing like 1 rawr or whatever and you didn't see that in the movie also on the movie poster,0.07597041
there's like a guy in like an old Knights helmet and there's a point in the movie where you see that same helmet inside of the car,0.16777472
it didn't really make that much sense,0.06548077
but at the same time it wasn't relevant enough that it leaves you really baffled or confused,0.06377263
if you don't understand this movie is not going to be because of that one 3 second clip in the trailer or that quick glance at that little Knight thinking so it's not like a huge deal,0.085953444
but you really don't want to see stuff in the trailer,0.11062154
that's not actually in the movie itself now something,0.060585573
I find very annoying,0.26777595
and it isn't even with the movie itself is with the people who like review this movie or review the trailer or just making commentary about it saying that this movie is race baiting and all that other stuff and it's racist,0.31571576
and it's just there's a difference between race baiting and calling out racism like that those two things are not synonymous like if you need clarification this movie was a psychological thriller that used horror and suspense to point out how racism still exists in a society that people are claiming as post-racial part of this movies intent was to show passive racism as opposed to blatant racism,0.2725739
a lot of us,0.052681632
who are sitting here saying that racism still exists and you guys are arguing it with us,0.25727314
because the KKK isn't ever,0.14903012
I mean they are around but because people aren't getting lynched they aren't getting which,0.33332005
and this is why I think what he did was very unique and special because the way Jordan Peele chose to point out racism was very clever,0.3154267
and it wasn't clever in a way that he was trying to be sneaky about it,0.31089434
he chose to point out passive racism as opposed to blatant racism,0.37751016
because when we see movies nowadays where racism is involved,0.22318996
it's very Leyton,0.12357839
it's very in-your-face and that's because in most cases movies with black people in it especially what a black lead is about slavery or it's about the civil rights era it's black people trying to overcome some huge thing because of their blackness even though that still exists,0.5876557
that's not our everyday blame racism for the most part is not our everyday,0.29788995
we deal with a lot of passive races of a lot of under-the-table systematic very coded language,0.24077928
that's the type of racism,0.5185767
we deal with on a day-to-day unless biro most of us would be a little taken aback as someone randomly on the street jumped into our face and caught us a like twenty thirty years ago that was the norm and back then black people most of them wouldn't even think of reacting to the way that we react to blatant racism now,0.52476794
and what was so clever and accurate about it is the way that he wrote the white characters and let's be real if you watch King pill,0.30965897
they know how to write like people but he didn't write them as blatant racist like you know before I'm not even gonna get into the plot twist,0.62862414
they weren't malicious,0.18113618
they didn't like imply black people were inferior to white people,0.81601006
they weren't saying I don't want this black guy in my house or dating my daughter if anything they were just really ignorant you know they kept saying that black people have special capabilities and their genetic makeup makes them better at this and that they were just saying a lot of ignorant,0.8037767
they were doing what a lot of white people do to black people,0.5154597
they always try to connect with us on a black level before they try to connect with us as just regular human beings,0.53490317
and sometimes it just goes too far,0.061755717
and so that's why a lot of people get so sensitive,0.07677614
when we talk about racism because they think we're automatically calling them a KKK member or Hitler or think that they're trying to exterminate the black population like no you're you're just a little ignorant like that,0.8317946
it's all we're saying just pull it back a little bit,0.14345123
so when we say this movie is about race,0.15471828
and racism is not about it in the same way that we're used to seeing it on TV and in movies there's certain things that were set in a moving you're just like like aha like,0.31189844
I don't want to give too much away,0.13632649
but there's like a point where he says it's a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture,0.09970112
when ironically okay I don't want to spoil it,0.1010192
I don't wanna give nothing wait there's another part where there's a party full of white people,0.659303
and the white guy says to Chris black isn't style,0.61191136
you know what I'm saying he's like black is what's poppin right,0.431717
now,0.031218953
that's not what he said but he said black is him style attack at the extra puppet um there's another point in the movie where Chris,0.5264422
the main guy,0.08992774
the black guy says why black people in the guy responds,0.6646178
it's a white guy,0.39033026
and he's blind,0.20987715
so I mean he doesn't know Chris is black unless someone tells him he's black so,0.6364068
it's not like Pele was trying to portray white people,0.5740919
as the white devil who are trying to single out black people,0.794439
I mean in a sense they were but again plot twist but anyway to wrap this up I really really enjoyed this movie I honestly might do a second video to kind of explain the actual movie because this movie was super intricate there were so many layers to it,0.08852085
and when reading comments and speaking to people about it there was a lot of stuff that they didn't understand a lot of metaphors,0.04833154
they didn't understand that like really popped out to me,0.096893586
so I kind of want to like open up the discussion to talk about it um,0.061010245
but that'll be for a later time but I'm just gonna say I genuinely enjoyed this movie I would encourage everyone to go and watch it,0.056720734
and I would rate this,0.077833734
I never know if it's supposed to be rating out of five or out of ten well already a four out of five or nine editing boom,0.15174788
