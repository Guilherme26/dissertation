The Farewell written and directed by Lulu Wang takes place primarily in China where a,0.027898468
family is visiting the matriarch of the family 9i the family is going to visit,0.115664795
9i because she's been recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer but the family agrees that,0.03143791
it's best not to tell her that 9i doesn't know she's sick she thinks that,0.14230938
her family is visiting her because of a family wedding which she's taken the liberty,0.076058425
of planning as each family member tries to enjoy the remaining time with 9i they,0.03395962
also hope to spare her from the truth all right so I've been really looking,0.046132483
forward to seeing the farewell for a while now I've seen the film be praised,0.016555091
pretty much everywhere and I've been like constantly checking my local theater to see if,0.048546433
they're actually playing it at some point since I live in a smaller area sometimes,0.031238355
8:24 films don't come to my area right away it's actually usually what happens and,0.05993238
that happened with the farewell as well I mean it took quite a while to,0.021468801
actually get here regardless I went in with high expectations and I have to say,0.021623125
that I believe those expectations were met for the most part I think that the,0.019116048
farewell is definitely a must-see primarily because it touches on a lot of important topics,0.025983404
such as tradition family personal identity and a lot of other things along those lines,0.023300054
but you could also argue that it's just a must-see because it's just a well,0.022494515
made film with the compelling story either way you slice it the farewell is an,0.025194496
experience that's worth your time and money because it's emotionally impactful the film was primarily,0.022321567
seen through the perspective of awkwafina's character Billy Billy is in an interesting position because,0.020802287
she's lived most of her life in America so her beliefs and customs more so,0.109155305
aligned with American culture more so than they do with Chinese culture she can't quite,0.114436865
wrap her head around why the family believes they need to lie to 9i about,0.27968943
you know her terminal lung cancer condition in America most families would never think of,0.071295045
doing something like this and there's even a point in the film where the characters,0.02186259
discuss how you know in America they wouldn't do something like this and how it,0.06396938
would actually be considered illegal in America at least in the film the characters believe,0.03265852
that Chinese culture is to you know spare their loved one from the truth so,0.042573083
they don't fear their inevitable death at the hands of you know their terminal condition,0.27366936
it's very almost heartbreaking to watch the characters hold true to this cultural tradition while,0.01023385
they have to internalize and live with the fact that they're not only lying to,0.067397736
their beloved family member but that their time with is very short as the movie,0.06336473
progresses you see the characters struggling more and more with the lying and coming to,0.07953135
terms with the fact that they're almost about to lose a loved one one that,0.021214036
they hold very dear to their heart and there's an unsettling feeling you get because,0.014705215
you and the characters all know an important piece of information that one of the,0.015057762
other important characters doesn't and that results in each scene feeling a bit tense and,0.016675489
with significant weight to it The Farewell also discusses culture and tradition insightfully Billy is,0.01761872
Americanized in many ways and she is often challenging the idea that 9'i needs to,0.017687233
be spared from the truth and I like to have the film focuses on how,0.024857912
culture can dictate what our ethics are and our overall decision-making what is deemed normal,0.037737865
varies from culture to culture and some traditions may even appear cruel to those on,0.042759337
the outside looking in one of the best parts of the film is the way,0.014468409
the characters have to you know grapple with upholding tradition and what they feel is,0.014870846
inherently right this is a constant struggle for them and it really is kind of,0.03390973
tough to watch but in an entertaining kind of way through and through the farewell,0.06137317
is awesomely performed I mean every character has their moments but as I mentioned Billy,0.023748387
is the perspective through which the viewer understands the story I think aquafina deserves to,0.02835678
be an Oscar conversation I think that ultimately she will become February she does a,0.02783195
really great job of showing the toll that this whole dilemma is taking on her,0.021635763
without actually breaking the wishes and respects of the family by outright telling 9 I,0.01213428
the truth so there's a sweet spot that Aquafina finds because her character is able,0.016504537
to show various levels of vulnerability based on who is around term there's another interesting,0.023298057
theme discussed in the film many of the characters attempt to uphold a cultural standard,0.0038574
that focuses on strength and sometimes not asking for help or omitting fears and weaknesses,0.03830327
this manifests itself and some of the characters behaviors and they ultimately suffer anxiety from,0.041437615
their issues that they just you know suck up and deal with rather than asking,0.4031058
for help but from a technical perspective there's two things I love about the fair,0.020250186
well in addition to what I've already mentioned I love how the film is shot,0.064164944
and I love the music the cinematography gives the film a unique visual style because,0.011680624
there's something just off about it but in an appealing kind of way many of,0.020878784
the shots are static a lot of them have characters in the frame with a,0.053888522
lot of headroom and the visuals help make the film feel off balance which is,0.0058336607
how the main character Billy feels for most of the film the music also helps,0.025305582
establish an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're experiencing something uniquely cultural and different,0.014042692
than what most of us Americans are used to the music helps create an atmosphere,0.05851421
that transports you somewhere else and it also helps make those emotional beats hit that,0.08986099
much harder there's really only one area where I feel like the farewell let me,0.017640006
down I mean you could argue that it is a slow film but I think,0.051419362
the payoff you get in the final act remedies that issue a bit my problem,0.026651913
is that I didn't love the second ending I feel like there are two endings,0.03667889
to this film and the final one feels like it almost goes against what the,0.033426143
first one did and also the weight of the story I mean the filmmakers didn't,0.012904563
have much of a choice and you'll see what I'm talking about once you see,0.030744122
it but it kind of diminished the impact for me just a little bit but,0.11999248
overall I really enjoyed the farewell I think it's one of the best movies of,0.03198469
the year and definitely worth the watch as for the pros cons for the pros,0.039510578
I think the characters and performances are awesome the film insightfully discusses a lot of,0.0058855447
important ideas and themes the cinematography and music are awesome and the emotion / fields,0.027810663
are definitely there as for the cons I'd say just a second ending exists for,0.040203035
a reason but I feel it does contradict the first ending just a bit I'm,0.07643559
gonna give the farewell a 9.5 out of 10 and definitely recommend you check it,0.031161193
out in theaters if you're looking for a well-made drama film this is the one,0.040682632
for you so did you guys see the farewell yet what did you think of,0.01823601
it and if not let me know why not also let me know your favorite,0.046393897
movie of 2019 thus far for me John wick 3 is still holding the top,0.018418936
spot but there's so obviously some time for it to be dethroned if possible either,0.018806737
