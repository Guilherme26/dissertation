Miles Morales finally gets to take the lead as spider-man on the big screen in an animated film like I've never seen before so let's talk about [Music] in the film Miles Morales is bitten by a radioactive spider in gains incredible powers before he masters his abilities he's thrust into an adventure to save all of reality from kingpins evil schemes along the way he meets several people who have powers similar to his own so I actually saw this one back on Saturday but as soon as I got home from seeing it I was just wiped out sick for a couple of days so I've been wanting to talk about this one and with that in mind go ahead and join me down in the comments section if you've seen it what did you think about it once you see that tell me what you thought about it let's have a nice lively discussion with that said let's get started talking about the good and the first thing that comes to mind with this movie is the look I have never seen a movie that looks like this before and that's very much a good thing they found a way to create this visual style that feels like a comic book come to life whether you're talking about the low framerate the way they framed the shots the way the characters are just animated and drawn all of it looks like a comic book and then beyond that inside of the story there's comic book page turns there's framing devices where it zooms in on a frame and that goes to another shot there's elements where words appear on the screen so many different things that I've just never seen something like this and so it's just a real delight to see this movie except for kingpin I did not like the look of kingpin we'll get to that and a little bit later but otherwise this is a movie that is just so creatively drawn in a new way to animate a film along those same lines the visual style meshes perfectly with the type of story that they're telling it's very comic book II when they're incorporating spider-ham and spider noir inside with Miles Morales and Peter Parker and to do that they picked a visual style that allows you to suspend disbelief in this context in a way and just go along with the story the combination of visual style and storytelling style create all these new opportunities to create a unique experience that is probably the most comic book II film I've ever seen another great thing about the film is the humor it has a very sharp wit in a very diverse sense of humor a lot of the humor comes from kind of poking fun a little bit at the Spider Man movie franchise but other aspects kind of tie into the different individual characters so spider-ham has big broad humor and then spider and war has this very dry self-serious sense of humor but in general it's just a clever script where the setups the running gags and then the callbacks they all pay off including a fantastic after credit sequence but of course with ties it all together are the characters Myles burrows leads the pack and it's fun to get to see this new spider-man take the lead and how his family dynamics shift the way this character becomes a here and what that looks like inside of his life perspective but all the side characters are given their unique moment to shine the unique spot inside of the script no one's annoying in a bunch of them like spider-ham spider noir Aunt May are all scene stealers my personal favorite was Peter be Parker I went in a little bit skeptical from the terms like what are they doing with Peter Parker but inside of the story they explain where he's coming from certain choices that he's made that have brought him to a specific place and they give him a really powerful arc that I thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end once I saw what they were doing with the character but what really surprised me was how developed the villain set was kingpin is impressively threatening as well as characterized for a PG movie what table to get away with ends making him a dangerous villain where there's real stakes while keeping to a PG rating is actually pretty impressive for the modern era beyond that his motives are clear we know what he loves we know what he values we know what he will do to get what he loves the other villains and the mix some of the side villains also tie into the story in different ways that I don't want to go into for spoiler reasons but all of it feels like a great set of villains from there let's move on to the mixed aspects of this film and the big thing that comes to mind here is that the film follows certain familiar formulas and templates in regards to team-up movies as well as story arcs about a new hero on an adventure with more experience here as you've seen some of these beats before you can predict generally when certain things are going to happen in the mix and it's obviously not a good thing I don't think it's a particularly bad thing because the rest of the movie has a lot of creativity to it but if you're someone that's very sensitive to kind of familiar beats and things like that it could be a problem for you from there let's move on to the negative and the big thing that comes to mind is the design of kingpin every time he showed up on screen it was distracting for me because I just don't like the way they drew him with how physically wide he is it just looks out of place with the rest of the designs for me so I did not like it and the other thing is that penny Parker seemed underdeveloped the other characters seemed to get more of their moments to shine you got a little taste of who they were a little bit more and she seemed like the one a little bit further in the background and so she should have gotten a little bit more time on screen that's it this is a very fun movie a very unique experience I have never seen a movie like this before it's very cool that we live in a time where a movie like this gets to exist before I give you my final scores go and tell me what you thought about it down below in the comment
