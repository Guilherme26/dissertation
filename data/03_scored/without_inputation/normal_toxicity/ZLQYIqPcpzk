hila,
I went to my review of DOMA,0.07276929
so if DOMA is the new film by acclaim director Alfonso column who is best known for making masterpieces like children of men and gravity and Roma is an amazing film is a film which is one of his best works,0.09880883
and it is truly truly different and personal and interesting so called writes directs photographs produces and Eddie's Burma and so the horror with his vision is exactly how he wants to tell me stories exactly how he sees the world and it's a really fascinating personal look at a point in time and the film is so detailed and specific it's so clearly about one single point in history,0.050944883
so the film was set in the early nineteen seventies embezzling just follows a few months in the life of a maid who worked for a middle-class family and that basically is the extent of along with about the fact that there is of events you've been it basically over Volga probably it's just a story this may live in this humble life working for this family,0.03139211
and there's all sorts of little and interesting things that Colin brings to the film he makes sure to imbue it with a real personal sense of history,0.046739288
it feels like a nostalgic dream like something that he reimagines from his youth the whole thing about Verma is that the whole thing was really crowded,0.10686473
there's a lot of characters a lot of movement and the film is constantly filled with people hustling and bustling around but the film manages to make us focus on the side poetry on the person who is just the servant,0.06727306
it makes us care about the people on the side the fingers on the side it make us care about the little details in the big crowds and Cole makes an effort to make this film about the little people that I'm present at like big events if over ideas in Burma,0.06569719
there's also this idea to do with women who are abandoned by men and having to grieve together grieve in a war where there's no time to grieve because they have to work,0.20881943
there's also this whole thing about struggle about people struggling to find where they are and in the end Roma isn't even really a cohesive story,0.07157361
it doesn't even have a real ending it just has an end point where they could I felt that there is no concrete ending to the themes struggle store go on work,0.074913494
store goes on just a scrapbook and a few months in the life of the character it's nothing more than just a collection of moment the collection of memories,0.07928838
it's not this great big expansive thing that has a concrete ending,0.19371238
it's not oh this is the end point of even that this fells be leading to not particularly it's just an emotional numbing continuation of everything that's come before,0.17705654
and it will continue after the credits at World,0.06318831
one thing the phone-- constantly reminds us is that the world is bigger than these characters even though they are small characters in relatively big events,0.053300053
those events are still themselves contain between the time and the setting but we see Coulter do things like plans in the sky and we have shot with your expansive,0.31089434
we see that with most of the world outside the story and yet it is all self-contained,0.07217673
the you thing had to say is that this is such a technically impressive film was,0.09213233
there's no,0.061242547
denying that I feel like children the men had innovative long takes,0.24067558
and the governor was a fantastic use of visual effects,0.10272042
I think Burma is probably quads most technically impressive work the when he manages to execute sermon in logistical challenging and technically difficult long tape filled with hundreds of people in stark black-and-white,0.24171343
it is amazing that was so shocked to me but I really don't know how he managed to do them,0.100094944
I also want to mention the sound design which is amazing this film is so incredibly cinematic,0.15543564
and the sound is like this big mesh of noise because the phone constantly thought of crowd we hear all sorts of sounds we hear the hustle and bustle of the city is so many scenes and he really makes the film come alive the technical aspects of this film are incredible and to send it to the film,0.08227494
in black and white about a pretty insignificant story,0.11318117
it is incredibly cinematic,0.11622882
I've also that vomit leaves me a little cold a little bit,0.4504468
although that really did when I watched it because it felt like a technically impressive showcase where the emotions were muted and I was expecting to feel more,0.0485371
but then after the first hour and a bit I really began to feel more and by the end I was moved and afterwards I can't think of the film without being moved by why we ultimately took me on the journey and so even emotionally it's a film which is complex in the film which seems distancing but it's actually not and so well not just works in every conceivable way,0.039090596
it's a real masterpiece a technical marvel and a really moving story that draws on themes and ideas that are fascinating,0.050142985
it's really personal,0.058486328
it's really really amazing,0.059278253
