liked the film and thought it was at least a six out of ten or,0.06041968
above and of course I'll get tomorrow rating a little bit later but what the,0.091454774
movie is about is it just about a girl in 2003 to the 2002-2003 she,0.101136774
lives in Sacramento California and she is just not happy with her life she feels,0.19624424

of listen or whatever so she's in high school you know they people start having,0.14989075
sex and all that and the main driving force of this movie is the relationship,0.61424744
that she has with her mother like I said it's being played by Laura MEC,0.154693
have no what the film did do right is giving a true interpretation of what,0.0567668
a teenage girl somewhere goes to in high school I'll give I'll give the film,0.150475
that they did a great job their film also did a great job with the,0.062497128

her mother Christine lady Berg my fierson she has the great well I want to,0.422162
say a great relationship with her mother but in the film it was a nice,0.14865437
exchange between two or whatever because they they get along but then they don't get,0.061991233
along it this isn't a Shirley at one point you know they're like arguing in,0.0706474
like a thrift store or a store or whatever like blah blah my mom picks,0.3298631
out a dressing like two seconds I know I love it and so they're just,0.15992013
like a lot of back and forth right there but for the most part I,0.055683978
did not care for ladybugs character she was getting on my damn nerves because she,0.7952147
was mean she was selfish she was inconsiderate and I can go down the list,0.49118313
name and more characteristics to describe her but she wasn't thankful for anything she was,0.13605195
always complaining and stuff like you know her mom and dad like were bending over,0.49735212
backwards for her but she just you know just took everything for granted and we're,0.12038405
just whine and complain uh I mean I mean seriously one scene she didn't like,0.31563973
the conversation that her mom was having I mean and it was kind of something,0.40336865

you know and I'm just like okay I don't see the you know that's a,0.11298907
completely unnecessary unless you're in bodily harm or whatever you know but like this movie,0.21702677
is only 93 minutes and I was so bored I could not wait to leave,0.114143245
it seemed like this movie was taking forever to end and like I said the,0.08538148
acting was fine you know the relationships was fine it felt realistic but I just,0.0587355
didn't care I mean I mean I couldn't relate to any of these characters it,0.04915378
