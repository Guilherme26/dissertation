hello everybody and welcome to reviews that don't matter what Jessica hit my name is,0.099317715
Jessica on today's episode we are talking all about Roma Netflix his latest bid to,0.06266811
get into the Oscars and guess what it did it got a whole bunch of,0.123758145
nominations and it's probably the front-runner now which is crazy because literally a week ago,0.19120926
I was like Stars borns the front-runner but somehow it's lost steam in about a,0.08640119
week and Roma has picked up major steam including a surprise Best Supporting Actress nomination,0.03700487
for marina date or vino I think is her name which her name has not,0.0975289
been anywhere in the conversation of Best Supporting Actress and it's definitely a little shocking,0.07182375
ELISA Aparicio obviously got nominated for Best Actress and she has kind of she was,0.115530305
kind of in that 5-slot wildcard of maybe sneakin somebody else in there but she,0.114563875
got in there you also have Best Picture Best Foreign Language Film I think you,0.091906436
also have Best Original Screenplay and Best Director and a whole bunch of technical Awards,0.041831158
I believe I'm pretty sure Best Cinematography which should definitely get there and I actually,0.057058357
think that it has a really good chance of winning that one but let's get,0.033938985
to what I thought about this movie I am surprised how much I enjoyed this,0.080159195
movie I I genuinely thought that I might be a little bored I don't watch,0.102092296
a lot of foreign language which is my fault I know and I also very,0.075401805
much you don't watch a lot of black and white Roma is a very quiet,0.35076335
story and there is a good like first 20 minute section of the movie were,0.040746473
like what is the plot of this like where are we going and then you,0.18588899
just kind of disappear back into the movie and then somehow you come out at,0.23974773
the very end just like really grateful for watching it it's a it's like I,0.054695148
said a quiet film but it speaks volumes it's a really corny thing for me,0.2896858
to say but I do think that is the case I think I believe I,0.057325564
haven't read a lot about this movie I believe this is Alfonso Cuaron's sort of,0.10619166
tribute to his mother which is really sweet I think that you leap to aparicio,0.4866196
I was a little skeptical of her because I knew that she hadn't really acted,0.16600686
before this but towards the end of that movie she's absolutely enthralling I do think,0.15210529
that Marina del Corvina I could be giving that last name wrong I'm sorry too,0.083725795
lazy look time to be I I think that she actually did a really great,0.44414178
job I watched Romo after I'd known that she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress,0.0848708
and I think she's deserving for sure there is a lot of those random movies,0.19756289
I have not seen yet so it's hard to say if I think that somebody,0.1494414
should win I think we all know Regina King is going to be winning for,0.05481503
Bill Street could talk and most likely Dame Judi Dench for the wife is gonna,0.09926335
be waiting for Best Actress one thing I will say is I don't quite understand,0.1507623
why it's in black and white I would really like to see this movie in,0.19322228
color personally I think that there are some scenes that it would really add to,0.06287247
it I feel like black and white kind of just adds that prestige Ness to,0.073633224
a movie which is really just like dumb which is why it like the Academy,0.6392944
Awards fail every years because they think that dramas are the only ones that could,0.08349302
ever be you know a Best Picture which is stupid thankfully it's changing a little,0.69542736
bit with you know Black Panther getting in there I think it's atrocious that eighth,0.50427574
grade is not in there and Bohemian Rhapsody is for Best Picture but you know,0.09005159
what some people liked it apparently this is also a film that surprised me in,0.08013708
the ending - with what happened to you Lisa and it was something I wasn't,0.061821185
expecting and I was like oh wait are they really doing this and that was,0.058859944
a moment in the hospital towards the end right before that final act at the,0.10261196
beach where I was like I'm really glad that this is not in color like,0.15345027
black and white makes this like easier to stomach and then it also is very,0.17288436
artistically crafted to make you feel anxious at times and in a way that really,0.04779062
surprised me as well considering this is a movie that really doesn't have much dialogue,0.090914175
and it's it's black and white and on top of that the foreign language so,0.13017486
I'm reading subtitles which sometimes you can get lost and reading the subtitles and miss,0.105074644
things on screen because of it but I didn't think I thought because there wasn't,0.034937665
that much dialogue it worked in this case and then that final act at the,0.058024853
beach with Alisa and the kids from the beginning of her kind of in her,0.10191321
own state of mind after what had just happened and the announcement that was made,0.06857598
by the the mother played by marina and then what happens at the beach in,0.07345661
a very much like oh no what is going to happen I mean you you,0.15121578
were just confronted with something that you thought was nearly impossible in this film and,0.060357224
then you get another moment you're like they're definitely not gonna do this right and,0.15254566
they do it in a way that that really like heals the souls of the,0.08078305
characters but also in my opinion the soul of the the person watching the film,0.059887424
because of just how hurt I think that somebody who's really into this movie gets,0.15474863
at what at one point and like how kind of just like shocked and like,0.049810037
almost bitter is a strong word but you almost feel a little bit betrayed by,0.3229519
this movie because you don't think it's going that way and then it shoves life,0.31089434
back in your face and that life isn't always fair and life is really hard,0.33070824
sometimes and then towards the end it kind of like shows back your your heart,0.1218908
back together in a really sweet way that makes you think that everyone's going to,0.09766966
be alright even though this terrible thing had happened and what I really liked about,0.12330134
this movie is it does not outright say anything like it really lets the the,0.07315778
person watching the movie fill in some blanks it has them kind of discover things,0.15049852
very slowly wonder about things it because there's not a lot of dialogue because we're,0.082751885
seeing it pretty much solely through he elites his eyes or Clio which is her,0.18004248
character's name Cleo's eyes we we kind of get snippets of snippets of conversations in,0.07958217
certain areas especially when it comes down to Clio she's a a main kind of,0.25517958
housekeeper she she lives in right next to this big house kind of connected to,0.17688595
it where her and her friend Adela I believe they're just friends there might be,0.10745382
cousins or something but I think they're just friends they are the housekeeper's for this,0.13001695
this couple who are both scientists one is like a biochemist and one is actually,0.12801664
a surgeon I believe so their doctors live in this really nice place and she's,0.1328385
part the family she takes care of these kids and you see at the beginning,0.062444493
there's something going on between the the mother and the father and then we kind,0.07744217
of don't visit that too much and we're looking more at what Clio is doing,0.08086972
and then you can another snippet of that and you're kind of placing it putting,0.20403539
everything together like a puzzle until the very ending where everything starts to make sense,0.08828739
then you start to escalate you see emotions boil over you see regretful actions taken,0.20060036
you you see the real loving care that this family has for Cleo it's really,0.095388144
sweet I would I would really recommend this to people even though it's kind of,0.08977972
scary because it's a four language film and it's in black and white but Alfonzo,0.102895744
Quran is one of the best filmmakers of our time especially working right now and,0.098376356
he just knows how to craft a movie really well and this is a very,0.07696449
personal story for him and I think that you know what I would not be,0.091527484
mad if Roma won best picture as well as because it's gonna win Best Foreign,0.19037141
Film and he's definitely gonna win Best Director in my opinion I mean you might,0.087274045
get Jurgis lamp the most coming in there's randomly actually is he even nominated I,0.27010968
don't remember it's a weird Best Director nomination like Bradley Cooper wasn't nominated I can't,0.06471425
remember if you're Atlanta most wasn't nominated they skip here freely which I Green Book,0.10424477
is the only of these Oscar films that I have not seen so I got,0.17077652
to do that before February whatever and but I do think Alfonso Cron's gonna get,0.06950885
a take Best Director and I think that it has a really good shot probably,0.24810931
the best shot at Best Picture but there are I mean a star is born,0.13026597
is still in the way green book I guess is still in the way I'd,0.063831545
be pretty shocked if green book won but there's still I mean in my opinion,0.07669296
out of the eight that are nominated I think black cap Landsman is the best,0.2607238
film it's what I would put towards it and to be honest as long as,0.10903382
Bohemian Rhapsody in I'm gonna be fairly happy oh with the Best Picture person with,0.07135797
the Oscars I would think that if Bohemian Rhapsody won I would probably throw something,0.15828563
at the TV but back to Roma because that's what this is about I do,0.050218
watch it please do it's on Netflix it's not very long it's like an hour,0.15999459
forty minutes just pay attention to it put your phone down during this and that's,0.08765273
something that I have a hard time doing at home when I watching movies putting,0.10382957
my phone down and I did during this and I very much enjoyed it and,0.07379276
yeah I think most people can enjoy I think it'll it'll touch a lot of,0.14170997
people's souls in a good way and y'all Souls need to be touched okay I,0.5034982
