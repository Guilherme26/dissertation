what do you say pal yo this is so tough i i just told you,0.10703527
that list listen i'm from the future how dare you point at me you you,0.18117976
were pointing they doing a boy first let me start by saying don't forget to,0.082613036
like comment and subscribe if you are subscribed hit the notification this was better than,0.07631545
i ever expected i mean they took a bunch of care and detail they placed,0.07777053
into this movie i mean so let's start at the beginning right so when we,0.069078006
first see miles and his family i'm like oh yeah that's a black dad yeah,0.39939746
that's hispanic mama yeah that's new york like the the ambiance and everything as the,0.38900575
father's driving him you just hear some spanish music in the background it's hustle and,0.08831293
bustle you see this new nlgger gentrifying ass shop um what was it like phone,0.80552804
party or some nlgger like that like you just see all this dopeness but they,0.5154597
wasn't putting a bunch on it right it just seemed natural and towards the end,0.09843619
of this film at no point this is what was dope about it at no,0.25672576
point did i even take into account yo he's black and he's hispanic until it,0.5876557
got to the end and i went this is some of the best representation modern,0.07977497
representation i've ever seen portrayed just period and for it to be in a cgi,0.06969923
ass cartoon ass marvel movie is like yo there was no patronizing at no point,0.7979127
did i even consider what kelly was and who he is plays a place in,0.06074107
the film it's not just there just randomly right even gwen her being a spider,0.24215245
spider woman or whatever it may it made sense right this was dope in the,0.24265023
beginning he's talking to people he talking to his boys and nlgger as he walking,0.5876557
down the block and you like yo that's what somebody would say like so from,0.2737354
then on at no other point was i going oh that's what they say now,0.07592705
i'm fully involved into it now i'm in this world and it seems real and,0.10737666
he speaks how a young black kid would speak from new york his pops and,0.6855679
his uncle like his uncle seemed like a uncle down now how he was dressed,0.37859467
down to how he acted like down to how his house look he looked like,0.15168457
a bachelor ass uncle right man this was so dope the way his mom she,0.91607404
would speak spanish randomly to him and nlgger like man it was dope then he,0.5876557
goes to uh he goes to a tech uh high school or whatever and it's,0.13309143
like that's dope like some of the most famous new yorkers that that we see,0.17978403
nowadays they've gone to schools like that where it's like this multicultural uh place and,0.09507143
it's like it's asians blacks white people and they all together and that these parents,0.5313885
send their kids there and it literally sets them off on a dope path right,0.1595058
so his mom is a nurse his pops is a uh i think she's a,0.5135173
nurse she could be a doctor the the pops is a cop and they they,0.07607424
strive to like get him into a better place and the pops told him like,0.09044561
hey man you the choices everybody has choices and he's like well what if i,0.08687291
choose not to go he's like no no you got to go right that's how,0.14044523
it is it's like he he wants him to do better and be better and,0.11361008
i just thought from the beginning from the very start of this it laid the,0.08663945
groundwork of who miles morales is what his family is what he came from let's,0.09609374
get into this artwork yo the colors mixing the comic aspect into it and doing,0.11927795
it in such a dope way it didn't sacrifice anything by doing it when onomatopoeia,0.26668763
was involved when thought bubbles were involved where um the coloring would change based off,0.07842984
of the fight sequences it all made sense and it wasn't there was no sacrifice,0.068466604
in doing that um the physics oh right so they could have just gone away,0.19066817
and played it straight let's keep this as real as possible but based on what,0.11776756
this was and what they were trying to convey the physics was just fire er,0.18169867
i maybe in the next film and i it based off that the ending it,0.10044471
seems there's gonna be a next film they're gonna go even more big but uh,0.051296495
until we got to that last part a lot of the fighting was it seemed,0.053979628
very closed in which was dope right because like it wasn't this spread out thing,0.23916446
even when they're running from doc ock and they're going through the forest it wasn't,0.07279759
this wide open area right or even when they were fighting against her inside the,0.29107463
building it's this closed-in sort of fight and i was like and then one of,0.17772119
the dopest scenes of the past however many years for me as far as action,0.41344532
goes is uh when prowler and uh the scorpion and the other dude they're inside,0.11202033
aunt may's house and they're fighting and they told him hey can y'all take this,0.10061803
nlgger outside you're gonna nlgger my house up and they tear the house up but,0.5558418
the fighting it was so dope i mean in this close little area so much,0.19193494
was going on it was like i would have to watch it multiple times to,0.07987363
catch everything that was taking place because it was all happening at once like some,0.08977198
they're like this is an aspect of like oh like some of these classic kung,0.15945572
fu films where they're able to do things at one time that it it just,0.31325564
it plays with your brain right but you can see the things that they want,0.44504845
you to pay attention to you pay attention to so well while he has the,0.13072504
goober and he's trying to escape whatever power's chasing him there's still nlgger going off,0.4516588
on the side and then every once in a while something would come in and,0.117985316
uh like spider girl spider woman whatever she comes she snatches the goober in it,0.4925342
all that was dope the story line with his uncle that was dope i don't,0.24728721
know how in my i don't know why i couldn't figure out who the prowler,0.1311053
was and when uh when he started talking i'm like wait he has a black,0.46239543
voice i still didn't get who the nlgger the problem was but yeah man i,0.2422264
still didn't get who the problem was this was so good um i should have,0.0691332
been able to pick that up though even down to the spider that bit him,0.24028906
the colors on it were like it was very colorful but it wasn't too bright,0.27556583
i can't really explain that this wasn't a very bright move film but the it,0.080567725
had so many vivid colors that it was like oh did they they did it,0.053326488
they did it right because this could have been a shock to the system if,0.057512775
it's too bright get like because it looks like a kaleidoscope when he's doing this,0.15533322
little inter-dimensional breakdown or whatever it was done perfect um the voice acting this some,0.16661112
dope ass voice acting every and everything they were saying it sounded so real and,0.83047426
so sincere and i really appreciated that even down to like how gwen was talking,0.16033167
to him uh uh peter b parker everything uh aunt may i liked that i,0.35832587
enjoyed this aunt may man it was and it was a bunch of things that,0.08613781
was dope to see right so i've been out of comics for a while but,0.1492737
it was dope to see all the spider suits in the basement or whatever in,0.23283869
the little layer or whatever um and then let's get to the dopest part of,0.3965178
the film all the different spider-man we got gwen we got peter porker peter b,0.18346372
parker spider-man noir which was fire i i want to see them do like little,0.30363014
mini like let's say the next film comes out let's do like some little mini,0.07633975
uh shows or whatever that like make it a mini series and each episode is,0.066043876
uh like some little issue that they're dealing with and it all leads up to,0.08347145
this to that to that film that would be so fire because i'm interested i'm,0.25833854
even interested in peter porker i i found that amusing that when i first saw,0.14885083
him i go yo is this even legal like that's clearly a rip-off of of,0.40322813
porky pig and like he has these like acme tools he has a a mallet,0.76844484
he has the um anvil and it's like for them to acknowledge that at the,0.21550822
end that was fire um man storyline was just dope man like i i had,0.39923954
no problems with it right i'm not expecting nothing too crazy but for as far,0.39750582
as the origin story fire and based off what they showed at the ending with,0.084635004
uh uh that uh other spider-man going to earth 67 yo we in for some,0.28567263
fly nlgger right man this is for me for me this is my favorite off,0.31089434
the first watch my favorite cgi thing i've seen i don't really enjoy those type,0.097537935
of movies right like i was even thinking to myself am i going to watch,0.12524505
seoul when it comes out this month i'm probably going to end up watching that,0.11094845
but that's probably a little played into a little bit why i didn't watch this,0.09617364
until so much so much further but man this was good this was good um,0.0991545
i want to know how they're going to take this though because this is so,0.09316687
um cool and they could have made it cool how can i put this to,0.07780592
the point where it was cheesy but they understood what people would want to see,0.09011999
so to see peter parker peter b parker see mj again and be like you,0.15286984
know awestruck or whatever you're like oh that was you know what i mean or,0.12004202
to see like for for me right i don't read the comments i don't know,0.10953144
if this is this way in this comics to see doc och reveal this doc,0.09805827
ock it never even crossed my mind that she was doc i'm like oh that's,0.3388636
tough right because my whole life has been some old white guy with the glasses,0.4802779
and nlgger only thing they changed was her sex it's an old white chick with,0.76829773
glasses man dope they they knew what they were doing on this the people who,0.2799651
worked on this understood the material and you could tell and they loved it and,0.07049018
nlgger with it and they understood what they were trying to convey and i got,0.40311512
it this was fire hey this actually makes me want to start watching some more,0.24844928
like comic uh like bass movies and nlgger like the uh rise of the superman,0.48849994
i plan on watching that maybe um they uh the and the x-men anime with,0.23591073
the wolverine anime that's coming on netflix soon i haven't watched that so i may,0.109022565
