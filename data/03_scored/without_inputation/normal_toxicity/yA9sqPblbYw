short pixar short called lava as we get to hear this wonderful hawaiian song and,0.11342949
we get to meet this volcano that is just full of love and full of,0.038441725
singing and this short had so much amazing beautiful textured animation i think this is,0.15034899
definitely one of the best pixar shorts i have ever seen i felt so much,0.08457517
emotion and i almost want to see a whole movie about what i just witnessed,0.08077106
it was just so magical and wonderful and beautiful and i really loved the song,0.0397816
what an amazing return for this great studio at least for this short i'll get,0.1284587
into my feelings of inside out in just a few seconds but i just really,0.23961705
want to focus just a little bit of energy right now and i'm almost done,0.06848091
about that beautiful short talk about in the comment box below what did you feel,0.15274349
about lava did it touch your heart it touched my soul and i actually clapped,0.43719193
afterwards i was one of me and my friend we clapped we were the only,0.112712674
ones in the studio clapping and i know this the animators weren't there nobody was,0.07500536
there to listen but i was just like wow thank you that was a amazing,0.045118872
short all right everyone let's talk about inside out this is the brand new animated,0.13559906
film two years of course we're getting more and more after this i'm a huge,0.08306141
fan of pixar i love their movies i think they're classics masterpiece great and good,0.06651337
yes you probably know what i'm talking about cars too i like it i don't,0.09533296
think i'll ever watch it again i'm not looking forward to cars 3 but for,0.07424679
me pixar's really never ever disappointed me they're one of the best animated studios if,0.15237562
not the best animated studios working today and maybe work forever i hope they i,0.1143621
just hope they live on and we get to see so many amazing stories and,0.05403675
if they make mistakes so what they know they're going to rise up above any,0.08050556
mistake they made and hopefully make something that is great and that's what i was,0.10675807
hoping for with this brand new film inside out of course we get to meet,0.10111686
a young little girl named riley we get to meet her parents but what's also,0.23468995
important about this film is that we get to peek into her mind we get,0.11900099
to meet anger and sadness and disgust and fear and joy and of course all,0.354292
these little weird characters and emotions are played by people we all recognize there's no,0.09141787
need to mention them of course you know about them already you know all the,0.051201265
voices what is hopefully going to be important is that we're going to care about,0.059801165
the characters we're going to care about the journey that happens between of course the,0.033339627
humans and what is going on in their mind and that's the adventure we get,0.10902557
we get to peek into the mind of what's actually going on in our head,0.24076135
of course we get to see this through this little innocent little girl that's going,0.31076297
to her first day of school because she's just moved well she's experienced school before,0.17969601
but of course it's a new area because she lived in minnesota with their family,0.12538986
and for some reason they've moved to san francisco though i don't know if that,0.09414852
ever is made clear but that's okay uh that's okay not not no no issues,0.11643418
right there but the movie kind of flashes back and forth as we get to,0.05048544
see her and her struggles something weird is happening thanks to the emotions in her,0.115911685
mind and the journey that they go on to to hopefully bring her back home,0.088631704
and bring her back to who riley is the person that she is uh emotions,0.25064853
and feelings and joy and happiness and fear and anger and all those things that,0.11896258
we all deal with on a daily basis but we never really i don't know,0.099382125
if we ever had a fun and entertaining insightful look into our own minds like,0.09959937
this movie presented i had emotions i don't know if i ever felt disgust i,0.34747222
never really felt disgust while i was watching this movie i never really felt anger,0.2991046
while watching this feeling but i did feel sadness joy and fear i'll get into,0.08892144
fear first because fear maybe can be some of my nitpicking complaints that i'm not,0.08596712
going to go in grand detail because i don't want to spoil anything but i,0.09967266
do want to mention my favorite character in this film is bing bong see the,0.07681517
film you'll see bing bong is my favorite character i love all the other people,0.15303339
but bing bong i can't wait to own i know they're gonna that thing's gonna,0.18746266
sell like hot cakes people are gonna have bing bongs i'm gonna have a bing,0.25872424
bong i haven't had a i haven't had a stuffed animal forever i want to,0.18280391
get a bing bong so see the film then you'll know where am i at,0.14516935
okay um so yes i had a little bit of fear watching this movie at,0.12833628
times because we're enjoying uh this whole journey of going back and forth but sometimes,0.02866518
i was like where is this film going i mean there's so much animation in,0.05970725
this movie that i'm trying to control myself because i'm like wait what's going on,0.15725982
over here what's happening over here am i having any emotional connection to all the,0.05089711
crazy insane things that are popping up and peering into the minds of what's going,0.49305832
on in this little girl's mind and how she's dealing with certain things and how,0.34951454
this world might be coming down to an end because she's feeling so much anxiety,0.2422852
and it's just i just yeah so i i have to admit there were times,0.08155128
in the film where i felt a little fear like i didn't know what to,0.091841325
make of what was going on but i really cared about the characters specifically of,0.031770356
course sadness and joy because we go on this journey with those two characters and,0.071224794
everybody gets a chance to shine in this movie of course the voice work is,0.07253038
amazing i liked the human characters i liked the emotional characters i liked all the,0.059902422
little surprises that we got to go as we get really into the mind of,0.079792425
this character i mean of riley and we get to peek into what she's passionate,0.1381897
about what she cares about and that's where the joy and the sadness kicked in,0.30632237
pixar is so good and this is you know of course pete doctor the director,0.11685445
of up and monsters inc of course probably some of the best animated films ever,0.24526072
made just especially up up is one of my favorites of all time and every,0.05807996
time i hear that oscar winning score i cry i cry i feel sadness and,0.16343734
joy uh i just i loved the insight that this movie explored yes it's a,0.08970222
family movie it's animation and stuff like that and kids will enjoy all the colors,0.18319401
and and the characters and the bumbling things bing bong yeah they're gonna i think,0.2448989
they're just gonna eat up bing bong bing bong's like hero okay um but i,0.16311
think the adults will appreciate it too maybe on a nostalgic level of just like,0.08049248
remembering the memories you had when you were a kid yes this movie focuses on,0.09519158
a little girl but i think anybody who has a heart and a soul can,0.35754314
connect to this story that's what makes this movie so magical and i do like,0.056483902
that it appears into the minds for a little bit of the parents and see,0.081916064
what's going on and how it's kind of shaped their lives and how you know,0.31089434
they're kind of set in their ways but when you're a kid it's kind of,0.11814154
weird when you're a kid i guess according to this film joy and sadness are,0.1742071
like feminine qualities also discussed according to this film at least and then anger and,0.25037515
fear are kind of more male qualities at least according to this film so that'd,0.24491826
be cool true because i think i grabbed some of my joy and sadness from,0.12706417
my mom and a little bit of my anger from my dad so yeah that's,0.2897336
yeah interesting you know just in sight that's what i appreciate this movie so much,0.09228265
why i appreciate this movement so much is the insight into the into the mind,0.14196208
the human and how it works and how memories work uh i think after watching,0.13152806
this film as a society we're definitely going to every time we have a thought,0.08691002
or something go on our mind whether it's something that's important to happen to us,0.0659982
or just a stupid song or commercial that's stuck in our head we are going,0.85379225
to think about inside out and that's what's so great about this film what's so,0.14216751
magical about uh the message of this movie and this is a film of course,0.084808566
and probably a lot of people repeating a lot of people what people said this,0.08352793
is a film that is definitely going to put pixar on the map again we're,0.07422932
never going to forget pixar yes they've made some mistakes but this is definitely a,0.06862328
prime example of why pixar animation studios is the best they can bring out so,0.09213292
much emotion and give us so many memorable characters and then on top of that,0.041252118
some of the best animation you're ever going to see i could talk about this,0.117309764
movie for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours this is uh i,0.12529129
predict right now i i do predict that this film will win the oscar for,0.07463519
best animated film i'm gonna leave it at that because i think it's definitely worthy,0.13303263
