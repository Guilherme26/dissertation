there that's 8th grade the movie there's a little bit okay,0.17760544
so because I know you've all been waiting for it,0.086858116
this is my review of a crate,0.110746145
so I I know a lot now uh people been asking for this review,0.103154294
but there's a few interesting reasons why I thought well first of all I apologize because this is one I did have a screener for like I could have saw I could have seen it early but uh there's two reasons,0.06169585
why not,0.06731109
well one is that I I think I was working that day or something like that,0.07467927
but then the other thing was you know I saw the trailer for this movie and I said you know this looks good,0.08658076
it kind of looks like I feel like,0.069942236
I know what this movie's gonna be though and we'll kind of get to that in a bit,0.14836535
it's one of the reasons why I'm doing this review,0.07717236
so this is very much truth in advertising,0.14147359
uh this is definitely a movie about eighth grade or rather the last week of eighth grade,0.10485256
I should say but but it's very much that that age of being around eighth grade and a lot of people's enjoyment of this movie is going to come from how they enjoyed eighth grade,0.17390172
and my guess is there's uh there's three people they're gonna have a certain there's three main responses that I think three people three responses that this film is going to get what its gonna be people that see it is just,0.05949903
it was the point of that nothing happened screw it which I get,0.31447265
there's not many twists and turns or anything like that in the movie by I mean watching the trailer,0.062176593
I think you could figure out that that's not the kind of movie it is there's others,0.11367663
that's gonna see it,0.07465079
for kind of the awkward strange confused but very important time in you know a child's life that will very much impact them as they become adults very much about closing one door and opening another and they will say man,0.15984176
this really connects with me like this is so honest so truthful,0.12917438
and this just really really holds a deep place in my heart,0.07161701
and then there's the third kind which a lot of people have told me they don't want to see this movie for this very same reason which is that they've gone through eighth grade and it wasn't fun that age is an awkward age and it's uncomfortable and it's not something that a lot of people want to relive I'm kind of one of those people and that's the reason I kind of wasn't interested in seeing this movie because I said I'm sure this is done well,0.12906893
but I don't look,0.10731622
it's specifically that Graem,0.05650149
that's like the exact grade I really don't like because we moved around a lot when I was a kid because my dad was in the Navy and so like he kind of it kind depended where we were if I fit in well or I didn't fit in well if I was popular I was not popular and 8th grade was just like just when we moved to a new place it from a place that we've loved and we moved to a new place that we did love and we just have we were all kind of miserable there,0.31089434
we just we did not fit in or at least,0.15233377
I didn't fit in to the new school,0.099641114
I was given to so given to but then when high school started and you know things got better,0.049097613
I got to know people better and stuff like that but eighth grade was not a happy time for me,0.098147795
and this is a movie that is not,0.06586984
it's not like a miserable movie or anything,0.3639775
it's not like welcome to the dollhouse but it is a movie that definitely very well taps into the insecurities of that age,0.1209995
and if I'm guessing correctly again I'm not an eighth grader but it seems like it's connecting it very well to like today's technology to the way kids talk now which I don't think it's too different from you know like when I was growing up but the but definitely the technological angle and the social media and and the putting videos online and stuff like that and finding kind of different outlets for what you're going through,0.083927356
so I knew a lot of people,0.09162087
I have a lot of friends,0.04986273
they were saying like,0.057571355
well I don't want to see that movie cuz,0.14760306
I hated eighth grade,0.3217475
I've knowed a lot of people that that said that so and they weren't interested but I had this one friend who was telling me over and over you gotta see this movie and on top of that Rotten Tomatoes was just praising the hell out of him even had this thing,0.31339577
this is why you should ignore the are rating on eighth grade and I know if they're talking about I mean it's like it's,0.15714595
it's are for a good reason,0.049951617
I mean don't get me wrong but I mean it's like I can't remember they say that many swear words,0.12897897
and there's a see if they do talk about like sexual stuff,0.57937413
you know easy freighters talking about sexual stuff,0.5639106
I think there's even a scene where like a woman's holding like a dildo or something like that you're like,0.80625576
yeah,0.040847696
if an instruction no so so this is very much,0.10143061
this is very much kind of letting people out there who aren't abating whether or not to see this movie like trying to help them figure out,0.097810045
what kind of movie this is you know is this something they would like if some people say it's very depressing other people will say is very inspiring,0.25371435
a lot of people say it's both,0.07475612
and my opinion is both,0.049792983
but it's it's kind of exactly what I thought it was gonna be,0.07075003
so if you're looking at this trailer and you're saying man that looks like a lot of uncomfortable awkwardness,0.18301351
you know and sort of like kids that you know are trying to figure things out but talk like they had things figure down,0.11879812
they're gonna embarrass themselves but it's also part of growing up and they're not gonna be liked by a lot of other kids or they're gonna be ignored,0.31089434
but then they're also gonna be liked by a couple other kids,0.13063991
and they have a sweet moment with like you know me the parents and stuff,0.06527389
it's that kind of movie but it's not done like,0.068008386
I don't know like American Beauty or something where there's like clearly a three-act structure where this thing that happened the beginning is gonna happen at the end,0.1366051
there's a lot of things,0.055468637
that technically don't go anywhere,0.09560953
there's a lot of stuff,0.06350219
where like she'll meet a new character and have a very unique scene with that character,0.09129327
and then just you never see that character again,0.07492976
there's kind of stuff like that,0.074328296
and and it's good that's like that cuz a lot of a lot of film is very much building up this very current you know time and place and personality and who you are there's even like a weird thing where she like puts away a memory box like from sixth grade and they opened in eighth grade,0.100930795
it's like what is that something that like only two years but but that's something a lot of it is you know sort of like,0.10293629
it's taking these steps and Serve going into,0.06977143
you know the next step,0.093134426
you know it's it,0.077257365
because you're going through tough stuff doesn't mean you give up on it,0.064824246
there's a lot of good things,0.05157769
and yes a lot of it I related to you know I think because we have moved around a lot,0.057950176
there's a lot of times where you know I I was kind of everything,0.07017937
I was the popular kid,0.06856237
I was the total loser,0.7141227
I you know ashamed to say I made fun of kids but I was also made fun of at you know some points,0.30417895
it's one of those things where it's like depending on where I was and how well I fit in you know that they were different experiences but that's also part of growing up,0.030953234
so I think it's also one of those things where if you look at this I like let's say you say it's greats the best time of your life let's just say you were the school jock,0.18251713
you know we're a sports team,0.10586455
and you did awesome,0.07819201
everybody loved you and stuff,0.104703225
you still gotta have something awkward like everybody goes through something awkward,0.4986577
I think everybody can find something in this that they can relate to in terms of like that confusion or even if you were super successful you know at that age you may think I got everything figured out and and of course you don't but but a lot of people have a age,0.050179776
you know,0.07163658
I think they do have a lot of stuff figured out or more things than they're aware of,0.051662043
and this movie very cleverly ties that in with her kind of video,0.27269438
v,
logs that maybe two or three people watch I mean nobody even watches them but she puts him out there to kind of figure her own stuff out very clearly and one of the things I like most is that the editing in this is very good is if she's invite to this party that this girl has ever already made very clear does not want her at the party is only inviting her because I think I think it's her mother because she's like what's your name again,0.18219106
it's kind of weird but um but but she forces her to invited to this party and she does a v-log saying like you know I I was having this party,0.15154289
and my dad want me to invite this friend,0.13881563
and I didn't want to but I did anyway and you know when I met up with her though I found out she was actually really nice and really kind and I'm glad that you know he made me invite that person over,0.084426925
so she's clearly changing things too you know almost play,0.07135706
it out how she wants it to happen in her mind and they're playing this video,0.1604463
while she's walking up to the door of the party which is very clever,0.13723347
because again it really taps into kind of what the mindset is at that age where you're kind of playing in what will happen,0.095480755
what you want to happen,0.07750533
you know hopefully making it,0.06831459
what you think will happen and you know if that's kind of what's going through your mind and me very much taps into like you know this person that has kind of social anxiety and she's not I like it because the the kid does not seem like your stereotypical geek,0.52157646
you know in a lot of these movies like the geeks are making fun of super super all the time,0.23793463
and it's just really you know just constant,0.058351025
and this kid just seems like a normal shy kid who wants an identity and she's still trying to figure out her identity and the videos are kind of her hobby in figuring it out,0.23320377
but it's also not like,0.069587775
it's clearly a journal,0.081989534
even though the videos are set up to like give advice,0.05786053
and I also like that there's kind of little victories in this like her going up and singing karaoke at the party which you never hear her sing which again is very clever,0.1884126
uh is a victory to her to a point where it doesn't matter how she sounds and nobody boos nobody rolls their eyes and obey or anything like that she sings and that's it and a lot of the time the movie the reactions of the other characters,0.13738373
it's not as much about that as much as her reaction how she feels about it,0.13118002
there's this scene near the end where she finally tells off,0.1273003
I guess not really a bully but she very much you know let somebody know how she feels about something,0.31912917
she does the whole thing without looking up at them,0.17021783
I mean I get very clever and we don't see how the kids really react we see a little bit while she's talking but when she walks away she just gets this little smile and it's like it's it's not,0.18398564
she told the person off in a really great way,0.1498971
it was super odd and awkward and uncomfortable but she was proud of it so it's it very much sort of hits those little victories and I will say it does not end on again kind of like welcome to the dollhouse a park Imperial a lot so that it doesn't really end on a note like that you know when I operate it back to that again,0.10204199
when I first saw welcome to the dollhouse which s where this is now review of uh I didn't really get,0.057172157
I didn't see the point of it,0.048860975
I'm like okay we're just seeing a person get made fun of for a couple hours,0.2040294
why is that interesting,0.06345212
why is that fun or anything,0.11346522
and when I got a little older I appreciate it a little bit more but it's still not really my thing,0.18264833
I have an appreciation for it but I don't really like it but I get why other people enjoy it,0.10741039
and I do get the comedy of it too,0.11850385
and I admire the harshness of it but with this film I feel like it's it's not quite doing that it's just combining enough a new stuff with having this kid can be someone that can disappear,0.26893198
but it's not like you know what the hell's that drew Barrymore comedy was it never been kissed or whatever where it's like in high school,0.52067864
I just disappeared and nobody noticed me yet nobody,0.18003224
noticed Drew Barrymore weird,0.22398357
no,0.06626663
it's not like you know just kind of a typical teen comedy,0.31089434
I mean it's done with a lot of heart and a lot of thought and watching this even though hobbies I grew up a boy I'm watching this,0.102659024
I'm saying okay,0.07550944
well I recognize that feeling,0.06026993
I recognize that moment I recognize but something like that happened,0.06983081
but I also recognize the nice moments,0.05437739
too so very much,0.05118557
the reason I want to do this review is anyone that's like if you see this movie and your thing,0.27975383
it's either gonna be all a downer or it's gonna be super sappy about and uplifting and stuff uh it's something kind of in-between and ultimately ends on a positive note,0.10604686
but it is I'll even say half and half,0.07435809
I'll say 70% of doubt or 70% a anxious uncomfortable awkward,0.08123485
you know that's probably better way of putting it because I mean there,0.106884494
there's a lot of movies about childhood are much more aggressive,0.1661784
and this is not an aggressive movie,0.07227908
this is very much focusing on sort of the awkward stuff that can happen and how it can impact a person,0.12586875
without necessarily having to spell it out to you it can just sort of show what they're going through when she goes to this party for example you know she she has this one-piece suit and nobody else there is wearing a one-piece and it's something where it's like she never says that she never mentions it but but you notice it it's like oh well like all,0.10775131
the other girls are wearing like bikinis and stuff like that,0.37800384
and she you know does not have you know the body's like what they have in stuff is a clearly a different friend group,0.14899614
but then like when they're taking the picture,0.10136568
you know taking the picture of all the girls together and they're all game together and they say oh we can't see you you know main character,0.16507846
we can't see you come to the front and you're thinking like well Kay they're gonna do the thing where everyone rolls their eyes or they push her off and they play some sort of mean trick,0.1513499
and then she turns into Kari and zaps everybody no but you know what I mean like does some sir,0.48088855
a mean trick and they don't I mean they just let her be a part of the picture okay whatever they they don't really like her but you know it's they're trying to be more realistic like that's what people would do,0.10951632
they just love being the picture and be like whatever you know,0.04680678
and that's kind of the feel,0.065363616
it's like most of it feels very legit very realistic there's one or two moments where they don't,0.053307503
sometimes the father does something like after he drops her off in them all he does something that I thought was very odd and kind of out of character even for him you know there there's another weird scene where like this,0.1518143
this boy is driving this girl home,0.36313477
and I mean you can see it's coming a mile away but he obviously tries to hit on her and tries to get with her and the way he does it even for eighth grade actually think it's 8th grade,0.15558703
I think it's like ninth grade this kid is very odd,0.26105055
and I don't know that felt very like the way was done when it was very very strange,0.09796263
but you know it didn't seem like yeah that's that age like now that's just weird um but you know once in a while they'll do a shtick that's like oh it's that stick way like I've seen this in a comedy but it feels mostly pretty genuine,0.15256053
and when somebody actually does want to hang out with her or she actually does get a friend that's really cool and she's super anxious and she practices how to say hello and stuff,0.27149203
you feel good that she actually like is connecting with someone and then you feel just as bad when you know something really uncomfortable happens and again a lot of it is kind of done through the performance and done through,0.12074067
you know just the various ways that they show what this person is going through you know visually,0.11180265
so yeah I guess what I'm trying to get across is that this is a very genuine movie it feels very much like eighth grade and even if you were super popular in eighth grade like everyone can find something in this movie they can be like,0.09438405
yeah,0.040847696
I went through that,0.04912228
yeah that's something I can relate to but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get into the movie you either say you want more twists and turns or a more traditional story or you'll say that this is a little too real,0.037957933
and I just that's not something,0.05361604
I'm interested in seeing for me,0.08347387
I'm glad I saw it,0.07447355
uh I don't know if I'd see it again for all the people that were saying like yes,0.16636702
this just a movie that shows the genuine awkwardness of eighth grade yeah this and it does it well but it isn't 100% downer it does bring up some positive things as and you know genuine joyous stuff but like I said it's 70% awkward uncomfortable you know stuff that maybe you'll really connect with um,0.065971576
I think it's no reason really one to talk about because it is a movie where I feel like there'll be a lot of people,0.08391275
there just like this is not the movie for me,0.062284883
and I I would kind of be in that category I just be like,0.040219095
I remember eighth grade fine hey you know,0.1079658
I don't need,0.09001829
I'm not someone that likes to go back and watch all home movies of myself or anything like that,0.14888099
I don't like remembering how awkward I was and I acknowledge it,0.24110784
I know I was but it's one of those things where I'm just like I don't like reliving it um but a movie like this very much can sort of take that feeling,0.063869834
it can say it's okay to you know everyone went through this,0.09248526
you know everyone went through sort of these different stages of awkwardness at that age,0.1026348
you know that's really that age and for some people maybe they forgot about it,0.07819138
and this kind of brings it back and it's very much about moving forward,0.038681336
and you know again there are some clever things,0.083411045
even though I don't know why it was two years that that time capsule memory box or whatever you know it's very much about that happen,0.08860502
now you know moving forward to the next step and they they do that in a very clever way,0.12181135
so this movie is a shot very clever,0.31089434
it's edited very clever that the sound design as well with where they put the audio of like her videos explaining stuff and what she says and why and and so forth is really good when she's upset when they have it go quiet,0.13018563
you know maybe you have her talk or just certain songs or whatever I mean it's stuff that you definitely recognize and I'm glad it doesn't take place in the 80s or the 90s,0.15268227
I mean don't get me wrong,0.12853672
I when something like that comes out,0.14288904
it's like cool,0.06273663
that's when I grew up but it's really everywhere right now and I think if you're gonna do something with that it's fine,0.05162662
people want to do something with that but they really have to have more to it,0.057668425
you know just a coming-of-age story in the blank decade it is getting a little old like you really really have to put a different spin on it which I think people can do and are doing but we're seeing a lot of kind of just ooh references the 80s the 90s or whatever,0.14500235
so I'm hoping that people kind of wake up more that there has to be more to it than that,0.090923846
and there is a lot to this,0.051294833
and like I said the fact that it's set now and it does address technology and sort of the different hobbies that people have I mean people are on there they're on their phones a lot you know in this and they're on their laptops and everything you know I feel like it's there's gonna be a large peep a large amount of people that really do connect with this movie,0.060635764
and so I kind of wanna make that clear to that is this is a very very good movie,0.07943624
it's a very very well-done movie,0.08487868
and if you're looking at this and you say I really want to relive what eighth grade is like or experience,0.14303072
what eighth grade was like this gets several elements even it's not exactly your childhood,0.24107754
it gets several strong elements of it,0.097792
but there are going to be people that just don't have an interest in that I'm a me for me the stuff,0.10238927
I like to I know what's ironic the guy that plays in this now a critic but the stuff I like to relive is you know things like movies and shows maybe see a toy I grew up with or something like that or a place or an environment,0.11376363
I like seeing that because that sort of brings back a lot of emotions and a lot of feelings that I connected to those certain objects when they actually bring up the actual emotions and and topics and stuff like that you know that's where I'm like because it's I don't know it's just strange as some people have different things they connect to you know when they bring up like the exact emotions I like talking about those emotions,0.07568778
I don't always like reliving them I like reliving them through you know objects and movies and you know places and things like that you know that stuff is fun,0.15371571
but like if you were to show me like a video of me watching that movie being in that place or whatever,0.24156007
I wouldn't want to see that you know it's a,0.08899232
I don't know man maybe it's too rose-colored or whatever maybe it's just,0.18815032
yeah,0.040847715
I don't always like looking back at how awkward,0.13757233
I am even though I acknowledge I'm awkward back then and everything but it's everyone's gonna have like a different reaction to it,0.08491145
and I've known a lot of people that have said they don't want to see this movie because of that they're like I'm sure it's great,0.13386178
I'm sure it gets down eighth grade I just have no interest in sitting a very accurate portrayal of eighth grade so um,0.13073504
yeah it's I hope it's a very strange thing to kind of say but you know like go see this movie even though didn't really want to see it,0.109603204
and you know I'm glad I saw it,0.07837379
I guess but I really feel like there's gonna be a lot of people that do connect with this film,0.09254412
um ironically probably not eighth graders I currently although you never know it's something where I feel like they would see it,0.08737262
and I'd be like okay cool,0.05887228
I mean but it's it's that age like you don't want to admit you're going through a lot of that stuff,0.18949737
you know but some people do and Ken and it's I don't know it's an interesting movie it does deserve to be talked about it does deserve to be celebrated because it is very very,0.09765549
well done it very well captures you know that that that time in life for a lot of people,0.08179512
but if Fame was watching the trailer thinking I don't know I just don't want to relive that you do relive it,0.09685527
it's also the positive with the negative,0.104783624
but it's it's a fair amount of negative to jazz,0.09298732
it's just not welcome to the dollhouse make um,0.43543437
so yeah I like I said that this was a movie I really just saw because a friend of mine was really recommending it and Rotten Tomatoes was was really praising praising the hell out of it and it deserves it,0.280909
and I really think it's worth saying you know if this is a very good special movie I think a lot of people are gonna have a strong connection to it,0.08954473
