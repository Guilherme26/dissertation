me want to call all my loved ones and I swear as soon as I,0.13659595
left this theater I called my grandmother tell her I love her hey everyone is,0.1901954
sure under for paperweights and today i want to be reviewing the farewell which is,0.10212266
directed by lulu lane the film stars aquafina who portrays the character Billie as the,0.003247381
centers around her family I'm her Chinese family who finds out that her grandmother is,0.16513936
ill does not have that much longer to live and so because due to tradition,0.14872892
they cannot tell her what is wrong with her so as an effort to get,0.15053296
two families together one last time they just basically stage a fake wedding to get,0.14863193
the family to come back into town to see ninety nine and to basically pay,0.09189692
their respects without her knowing they're pairing their respects because she doesn't know that there's,0.15473087
something wrong with her and so one of the interesting facts about this film is,0.11378813
actually based on Lulu Aang's life as this situation happened to her she found out,0.19966848
that her grandmother was actually ill so in the beginning of the films that says,0.31089434
that it is based on an actual lie so for those of you who are,0.403093
new to my channel I tell you what I liked about the film what I,0.057367694
didn't like about the film is should you pay your wait to see this film,0.08810644
in theaters so I actually had the pleasure of viewing this film earlier in the,0.0673793
year at the Sundance Film Festival when I wanted to see it a second time,0.03695638
mainly because I was dying of a viral infection when I saw this at Sundance,0.10943465
but I would have to say that I really really enjoyed this movie this is,0.079107165
definitely one of my top movies of 2019 and so going into what I liked,0.07278932
about this film I would have to say that aquafina who plays the character Billy,0.111941025
she just such a fantastic job and really one of the first romantic roles that,0.064358234
we've seen her and we know her more as this comedian this rapper that we've,0.100951046
seen in crazy rich Asians we've seen as some of her YouTube channel stuff before,0.5221062
she I'm started doing films and I think that she does such a great job,0.20029636
also more so to the point where I want to see her in more dramatic,0.24128091
roles I think that she really brings you in on this journey she made me,0.11241764
feel like it was my grandma because that's how sad I was watching her but,0.1332345
she finds a great way to balance kind of the drama the sad aspects of,0.1508203
this film because it does deal with grief and it deals with how not only,0.09669753
family does with grief but what happens when you know that you're losing someone close,0.10737544
to you and you know the that time together you know it's very limited and,0.09272158
I thought that she did a very great job of conveying that on the screen,0.12998638
and actually making you feel the same type of emotions that she was feeling but,0.09563462
also to do to the scripts they do a very great job of balancing such,0.054818355
a heavy topic and balancing throwing some comedy in it whereas like we know there's,0.12856726
a sad moment but there's something funny that happens where it's just like okay I,0.07901939
can laugh I can breathe I'm happy again but I would have to say what,0.08087684
are the other standouts of this film and I want to make sure that I,0.096908264
get her name correctly the Xu Xin xao who plays nine night Billy's grandmother she,0.24087872
just such a great job on screen of you really understand why everyone is so,0.07972095
sad not just losing you know a close family member like the potential that you,0.115121394
could lose her but she just has such a great and warm spirit on screen,0.15428407
she's funny she's nurturing you just wait I want her to be my grandma not,0.3169748
saying that I don't love you grandma because you're my favorite grandma in the whole,0.18454233
wide world but she was great I was just like hey grandma I want you,0.20313574
to be okay like I don't want you to go nowhere but yeah like I,0.22007371
had a really great time watching the farewell I think that I learned a lot,0.05488769
about Chinese culture I didn't know that there was a thing where if you were,0.12396566
sick with a certain type of disease that instead of telling you the family chooses,0.44727486
not to tell them because they don't want fear to overcome and take them out,0.14873229
early you know a lot of people when they hear hear that they're sick it,0.4032096
does something to their mental state and they really give up before even beginning the,0.24978611
fight and so I felt as though that even though this movie is based on,0.15153977
a Chinese family I learned a lot about their culture but also too there were,0.12062497
a lot of ways that I was able to relate to their situation as someone,0.060425706
who I lost one of my grandmother's a couple of years ago I've lost my,0.10650649
father I found a way to relate to them the situation very relatable if no,0.048078436
one's gone through this I'm very happy that you haven't had to go through this,0.10471191
yet but also to seeing the generational differences as we see how her father deals,0.061296508
with this situation as her mom deals with this situation showing how people deal with,0.14965376
grief in different ways some people are very emotional one of the reasons in the,0.070253976
film they don't want some of the children to be around because they feel as,0.13474153
though they can't hide their emotions and even also to how we talk about those,0.050933905
who find it hard to deal with grief and to show grief and to show,0.08478145
emotion as dirt dilling you know with this sad circumstance but also to I did,0.22932386
enjoy the aspect of showing how you know Western culture versus Chinese culture is so,0.15132526
different because in America you know there's no way that you cannot tell someone that,0.12511116
they're sick or they're ill on vs. as Billy's trying to understand her Chinese culture,0.60456264
that this is a way of life this is what everyone does as she kind,0.15423016
of learns how to deal with the situation but if I had to say anything,0.07910737
bad about the film there are a few points in the film where the pacing,0.09938178
is a little off that the movie starts to fill I'm a little bit long,0.14893907
but it happens very few and far in between in the film but overall for,0.041101016
me I had a great time watching The Farewell I cried I laughed I cried,0.1583445
again and laughed again and it really felt like a therapeutic experience kind of watching,0.08276934
someone deal with this grieving process I'm even resonating bringing up some of some of,0.11667721
the different ways that I dealt with grief over the years of my life but,0.090017565
yeah what I would tell you guys to do with you and Gert coins for,0.1407626
the farewell I would tell you to pay this Cephas film in theaters aquafina blows,0.31742588
it out of the park a little um a little own way I can't wait,0.07452289
to see what she does next I think she's actually working on a sci-fi project,0.110430285
NYX but I had a very great time with a farewell I would recommend this,0.08348562
movie to everyone to go see it right now in theaters but those are my,0.056176037
thoughts on the farewell as always my name is sure honor from Pierre awaits and,0.096838705
