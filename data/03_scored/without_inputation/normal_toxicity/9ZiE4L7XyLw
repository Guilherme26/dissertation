now finally i can't get over you two,0.08546914
she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous,0.18547557
it's so awkward at this table yes i don't wish to be the one to say it but it's late his last note is who is laszlo not catching up to the fact that elsa and rick got like a little thing,0.18258274
oh i really can't say though i saw him quite,0.07380771
often in paris saw him quite,0.060496606

if she loses that that's dirty,0.54075646
you know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands he's gonna leave elsa,0.150082
there must be some reason,0.041357435
why you won't let me have them,0.10309295
there is i suggest that you ask your wife oh threw elsa right under the bus,0.4445361
i mean you're not as good as sam but whatever makes you happy,0.28221586

oh thank you very much [Laughter] observe that in casablanca human life is cheap,0.286418
you had to make a choice girl,0.15078008
and i would choose rick did he give him a reason,0.08665966
he suggested i ask you yeah girl you know were,0.13114382
you alone in paris,0.13798973
yes victor,0.056125116
i was i know how it is,0.047724843
oh yeah she was lonely,0.24102803
i thought he said were you alone and i was like,0.089656465
so that's why she said he was dead because she really didn't think he was because he was in the concentration camp of course,0.21708193
i'd be careful so he's probably gonna die tonight is she gonna go see rick,0.69542736
i would talk about a late night booty call,0.40320823
richard i had to see it was,0.05225783
richard again we're back in paris,0.048455168
he is so sheisty,0.18736674
i love it fighting for anything anymore except myself i'm the only cause i'm interested in,0.2411792
that's what heartbreak will do to you girl you did that to him,0.15789138
you knew what really happened,0.07764601
if you only knew the truth i wouldn't believe why don't you tell him,0.23391862
she has a gun,0.31800205
i also didn't come to play all right,0.085218124
i'll make it easier for you she won't,0.10023353
no,0.06626663
she won't do that ah she's pretty even when she cries uh can't relate,0.3185887
and if you need proof go watch fried green tomatoes you knew how much,0.09727044
i loved you,0.07784015
well tell him how much i still love you,0.06722962
oh they kiss it why weren't you honest with me,0.26434955
why did you keep your marriage,0.15148278
a secret it wasn't mice,0.093949884
well she didn't keep him a secret,0.13140635
she said that she had a man but he was dead all except one he won't,0.24166541
have you,0.054184206
oh they're back together,0.07779421
oh i love this,0.05559734
so i wonder if laszlo is gonna get the the transit papers and then he's gonna leave elsa like and it just all magically works out like that,0.07307818
oh wait i forgot that laszlo doesn't know that elsa's there if we stop breathing we'll die we stop fighting our enemies the world will die good point,0.5876557
it's perhaps a strange circumstance,0.0917507
we both should be in love with the same woman,0.2201987
oh so he does know we use the letters to take her away from casablanca do you love her that much yes,0.1385762
i love her that much wow i didn't expect that from laszlo you're not very subtle,0.24023028
but you are effective,0.08070735
i i get the point,0.070448525
i respect that you get something really big something that would chuck them in a concentration camp for years quite a feather in your cap wouldn't it,0.46873167
oh would you really do that to him though but you were never interested in anyone she isn't just any woman i see he was in love with her before you don't know his story,0.19149391
and by the way call off your watch dogs when you let him go i don't want him around this afternoon,0.34655863
i'm taking no chances louie not even with you,0.35686424
i mean telling him your full plan isn't that kind of taking a chance on him be rick's without them well so long you're not gonna take sam with you,0.14864728
but sam was with you in paris,0.13202645
i'll never be the same without you ricky i know what you mean but i've already spoken to ferrari you'll still win at roulette is everything man,0.17961037
this is when elaborate set up quite often we'll tell him at the airport,0.027480608
he hasn't told him that he's stealing his wife not so fast louie nobody's gonna be arrested not for a while what i didn't see this coming under the circumstances i will sit down,0.5766033
good idea,0.080782115
gun is pointed right at your heart that is my least vulnerable spot,0.444751
i wasn't ready for this plot twist,0.14439946
i had no idea airport,0.05609961
huh this is captain reynolds speaking there were two letters of trash and he called the german sheriff guy it all adds up to one thing you're getting on that plane with victor where you belong,0.5245894
no what oh my god what what about us we'll always have paris,0.08120712
but she's gonna miss you for forever just when i think the plaque couldn't get any thicker,0.18911168
and the german officer is coming i would advise you not to interfere,0.31089434
i was willing to shoot captain rhino,0.5910444
and i'm willing to shoot,0.6682515
oh suck it,0.8988335
oh,0.046070345
my god,0.043388672
oh my god okay major strut has been shot round up the usual suspects and he protects rick wow i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,0.12019187
that's another famous quote it's over let's talk about it,0.05398084
oh my god that ending,0.15043448
what an amazing ending there was so many double croc oh my god it was wow the relationship between rick and the french officer louie they're best friends at least now they are i'm very sad that elsa and rick didn't end up together but it had to be hold on but it had to be that way so they could go to america and continue to fight the good fight,0.10606094
and now rick's getting a little all inclusive vacation to lay under the radar for a while to lay low and he gets to keep his bar sam stays employed carl stays employed,0.06287969
that's really a happy ending for everybody except the german officer who got shot but like you know history bad things,0.44692177
were happening this movie had everything,0.113037914
and i've heard that quote here's looking at you kid and i feel like we'll always have paris is another memorable quote,0.063650295
and then i believe this is am i sweating that bad oh lord i believe this is the start of a beautiful friendship,0.11097593
if i'm missing other any other famous quotes,0.051431157
please let me know in the comments it had action,0.07636404
it had romance it had suspense it had double cross and two time and no gooders but also double cross and two time and good gooders hold on which one was humphrey brogart,0.15367319
i i hope it was rick because rick's a cutie humphrey bogart was rigged and let me tell you something humphrey bogart could get it that was such a good movie it's just a classic hollywood feel elsa was beautiful rick amazingly handsome,0.205271
and it was funny,0.0925974
that's another thing i haven't touched on it was,0.11227908
so witty the dialogue was so sharp and funny and i had a great time beans are we gonna have to get our hvac redone if you keep sitting on the ductwork i'm gonna give casablanca five out of five stars it had a little bit of everything wit humor gun violence two timing a cutie as the lead male acuity,0.12455018
as the lead woman i couldn't guess the ending the plot got so thick i couldn't breathe oh the tension the tension between rick and elsa,0.16906065
oh the timing was never right for them,0.111803256
