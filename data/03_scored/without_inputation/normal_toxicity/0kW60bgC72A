oh my the liberties taken with the Marvel Thor mythology I was very surprised but I guess when you've made over 12 billion at the box office this,0.093880855
Kevin Feige has done wow that's quite a that's quite a feat,0.068450615
he's a Hollywood superhero,0.15247053
you can do whatever you want,0.10551808
and it does saddened me to some degree to see the comics become the cart rather than the horse,0.10116639
when it comes to these characters,0.09650351
but that said I did feel it many times while I was watching this movie from the very opening scene that I was reading not just a Thor comic but a very good Thor comic and while Warner,0.058466308
Brothers is trying to learn Taika Waititi away as we speak for a live-action akira which I totally get by the way many times during the film when I didn't feel like I was reading a Thor comic,0.071689986
well just really on the planets a car basically but for the four fleeting moments I was like a live-action Akira oh there it is again,0.05512996
I mean he's kind of in some ways already done the groundwork for it,0.11062049
but I would really like to see Tyco with TD stick with Thor as I think he'd do a fabulous job exploring the nine realms and all its fantastical elements like frost giants light and dark elves etc,0.102537
I already said oh my when I opened this review,0.15197712
but if you're reading the current Jason Aaron run on thor ragnarok with rustled ottomans artwork shout out to wrestle daughter min the artist on my my own comic super via but I think Taika Waititi would do a fabulous job bringing that that very colorful fantasy stuff to the big screen which is kind of to some degree what he's done here,0.088127665
now this is a non-spoiler review,0.06954387
and I was again genuinely surprised a handful of times while watching the movie and I think that it was a mistake for Disney,0.08581682
Marvel to release this film across the globe and what's essentially a two-week rollout,0.087331034
that's such a slow rollout because I feel that without the surprises this film is going to seem weaker than it is,0.21568203
and the surprises are too big too important too,0.05094882
well I think that what's really without giving them away,0.12289402
what's really a big deal about them is what they're going to impact there gonna have on the MCU going forward,0.06795356
so there's no way that you're gonna be able to avoid them,0.116013154
I mean good luck to you but it's just not gonna happen,0.1516475
I mean I already went in as early as I did knowing some stuff,0.0698464
particularly about the end credits sequences which you know really are known on and credit sequences,0.0545839
and I would I wish that I had not known even that and it did lessen the impact for me so good luck to you and Marvel Marvel and Disney really shouldn't have put you in that position,0.090374105
now why would,0.05698338
thor ragnarok seem weaker without it surprises,0.18455938
well that's because Taika Waititi is still growing as a filmmaker,0.08448858
what have you correctly interpreted,0.06965291
my emoji pre-review right when i got out of the theater,0.09867082
and that's the thor ragnarok is a colorful funny party with good music,0.06914803
it's like the first guardians of the galaxy,0.10679442
and I'm very specific with that distinction the first over the second and I'll explain that in just a moment but the very first trailer for Thor Ragnarok which rocked the world made the movie seemed a little grander,0.06769565
a little more epic a little more revolutionary than it actually is I mean when Kevin Feige said he was gonna take more cues from James Gunn,0.11527487
I had no idea that meant he was basically gonna duplicate James Gunn and if Taika Waititi is indeed following in James Gunn's footsteps and that means there's a knock out emotional moment like with yondu and volume 2 on the horizon for him,0.06487309
but it's not in this movie there is a difference by the way I want to clarify between James Gunn and Tycho with TT James Gunn is more lowbrow frat boy humor whereas Tycho with TD is more quirky highbrow humor which I prefer,0.24848197
so that's why I like this,0.06272381
I like this much better than the first guardians of the galaxy although that was a huge hit so I'd be curious to see how this one comes across,0.06635672
now again,0.041201644
this is a colorful party with good music,0.07195512
and I wore this shirt by the way intentionally for this review because I feel this is this would fit in with the movie very well right it's a big bright loud pig shirt that's fun to wear,0.31089434
but I would like to add to that description cuz the more I thought about it what I'd like to add to that is it is a colorful fun funny party with good music and good friends,0.04055197
that's a really important distinction that is something I did not expect in the film that was a really pleasant surprise,0.039413404
and that's the camaraderie,0.06549293
I mean we're sixteen movies and a decade and at this point when it comes to the MCU Wow and the tremendous payoff there which I only notice with this movie Taika,0.110207334
Waititi is the first to do something with it,0.07196395
and that is the depth of the relationships that have developed between these characters the shorthand that has developed what they still don't know each about each other which is very telling and also their relationships with us,0.058419313
all of those things seem very real in this movie for instance,0.09319359
they're some of the quieter moments in the movie particularly when Thor and banner catch up really you know that was the closest this movie came to kind of like emotionally hitting me and the more I let it wash over me,0.18131053
the more of an impact it kind of makes,0.05480837
I think this you know I wonder how this movie would do with repeat viewing I want to see it again,0.09892758
it could actually you know,0.055076607
I think maybe I think it's just a fun as I said a fun party who doesn't want to spend more time at a party but these little moments do shine and I think that I wish that Captain America Civil War had had had a better grasp of this because that was supposed to be a whole newly about relationships these specific relationships,0.11027331
but perhaps the problem there is that that will be focused on the - that's right - most self-involved members of the team Steve and Tony Steve is,0.06306429
very self-centered and so seeing the Avengers not only as,0.307701
a team,0.059149906
but as an experience through the eyes of Thor and Bruce that was fascinating and I'm telling you that yondu moment is coming for Taika Waititi if he could do that here,0.087254226
you know what he did achieve,0.13913159
now another reason that Taika Waititi has to stay is that I didn't get it off of anything the movie goes by very quickly at a very fast clip and it has a huge cast,0.07516135
and so I could have used more time with each and every character,0.084060885
in fact it really is two movies as many of us suspected,0.05970136
I would have preferred that they had had an entire movie about hella and an entire movie about Planet Hulk it's Planet Hulk,0.15799168
and I almost you know I felt I'm sure Hulk fans will feel feel it right,0.070866495
here,0.053441156
if you want to you're gonna have an emotional moment when you see Hulk you know perhaps his greatest storyline taken away from him and given to Thor and also stripped of a lot of the emotional heft and seriousness of that story but you know it still it was good you know I think considering the problems with the universal situation and a Hulk movie could only be distributed through them,0.06292471
this is the best we're gonna do,0.0659028
but and I would like both those movies to be directed by Tyco over TD so again because no spoilers here are my quick impressions of the top characters in the movie Chris Hemsworth as Thor I've always said when I especially you know right after the last Avengers movie I was like you know age of Ultron,0.08388773
I say Whedon gets it he's the only one who gets it the strength of both Chris Hemsworth in,0.091516554
Thor is comedy,0.15438421
well Tycho would Tina gets it too,0.084068514
and it makes such a difference,0.027104354
I mean he's here the character is finally realized to a degree that allows him to stand shoulder to shoulder with cap and Tony cap and Iron Man the way they were supposed to in the very first Avengers movie Thor is always lagged behind boy did I have fun watching him fly with me on earth,0.13157688
that was just a side note that was a great no saw some great moments,0.06112789
but you know again you know truly realized on the silver screen finally a cate blanchett as hella it was such a joy to see a female character with not only so much raw power but who wasn't afraid or ashamed or hesitant even to use it,0.13853392
it was so great if I was going and cost you this year for Halloween I totally go as hell up just the way she walked into a room and owned it just the way she forget face acting,0.3544497
Kate Blanchet does I acting,0.09488894
it's amazing,0.06327286
I hope she's part of the MCU for a long long time Jeff Goldblum as the grand master one does Jeff Goldblum not improve a movie although even more impressive was that there were a couple of times here where he didn't just seem like space Jeff Goldblum but he actually blended in with the movie that was pretty neat,0.07180966
Mark Ruffalo is the Hulk I'm sad to tell you that you've seen most of his role in the trailers and the clips that doesn't make it any less fun,0.08281525
but I would have preferred more I mean he has actually pretty small role in the movie and I'm getting pretty tired of his almost relationships Banner you tease and then Tisa Thompson as Valkyrie she did as much as possible and makes quite an impression with what is a very underwritten role,0.14761095
and as it's presented here quite frankly unnecessary,0.11785008
some of you have asked me about that her her saying that Valkyrie is bisexual in the movie no,0.53490317
she's not it was never hinted at once and I don't know why she would say that it just it distracted a little bit from her character actually to be honest with you because she kept waiting for that other shoe to drop and it never did,0.14952116
so in some ways,0.17453761
she didn't feel fully realized because Tisa Thompson put that out there,0.10661272
I will talk about all of them and everyone else in the movie more in the spoiler review,0.15814361
but finally the last thing I want to talk about here is the score which I just purchased it's so good by Mark Mothersbaugh,0.1275996
it was one of my favorite,0.06263853
things about the movie in fact that I can talk about in the non-spoiler review and it's the perfect fit for I wrote this down very specifically for a quirky offbeat sci-fi fantasy that wears it's hard on its sleeve downs me to buy the very large mug and laughs with a glimmer in its eye as it Pat's you heartily on the back while telling a good story,0.09468357
that's what the score is like that's exactly what the new,0.08504054
Thor is like,0.05216168
and what his new movie is like,0.07801701
and it's perfect,0.05992885
I actually do feel that this movie could be captured in the in the glimmer and Chris Hemsworth's eye it's perfect,0.075668804
so I highly recommend thor ragnarok just realize the stage at which this movie is in and also with the stage title with TD is in as a storyteller,0.05057555
I'll get there,0.027442766
but this is very very promising,0.08610473
it is one of the most entertaining MCU films I've ever seen,0.11273259
and I really I hope that Kevin Feige can hang on to Taika Waititi and that the Thor trilogy starts here this just seemed like a fresh start for the character,0.06633256
and I would hate for this to be where he I mean if he has to go out on this note with in terms of his solo movies fine but I can't you know speaking of cap and Iron Man of the three of them no one deserves another movie more that I think Thor I was very very happy with it,0.17462061
I want to see what Taika Waititi does next specifically with these characters,0.11405586
so that's my non-spoiler review for Thor,0.0724978
Ragnarok leave your own thoughts about the movie down below,0.16803855
please don't put any spoilers,0.1511742
