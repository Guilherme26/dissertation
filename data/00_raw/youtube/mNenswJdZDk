you know maybe just maybe we've been a little too hard on M night Shyamalan because apparently coming up with endings for thrillers is hard just ask Jordan Peele who in my opinion is now 0 for 2 although I do like his nifty new title a car door opening sequence for monkey paw productions it's so Wes Anderson 8 but back to M night and I suspect by the way we're gonna be seeing a lot of monkey paw productions just like we've seen a lot of at night and we used to love M night remember that the sixth sense with alt was also nominated for a slew of Oscars and Peele just like M night has quickly become a master of coming up with very cool intriguing ideas what are they differ though to be honest as the peel leans in heavily to social commentary which makes I think it not only makes you really root for the guy while we rooted for M night at one point but you know PL seems to be doing I think in some to some degree is doing so much good that you're not only rooting for him but it makes a little harder to criticize but I do it with love and I have a lot of good stuff to say here too so I hope that it washes out and it's constructive criticism I believe I feel like the ghosts of Hollywood future if these shadows remain unchanged this is the future I see for you Jordan Peele learned how to write a third act alright so anyway on the one hand when it comes to opportunities for black actors and representation for black audiences peel is doing truly extraordinary work it really is cool to say it's like yeah I'm so happy and it's good it's really good work which we'll discuss however peel has admitted that us the movie is a Rorschach test like that teaser posters you might recall and he intentionally has no clear answers or message for his audience some of you might be like oh I love that but here's the thing if you're if you're gonna have if you're gonna be really loose on the message and maybe some of the answers then your narrative has to be stronger in terms structurally right you got to have got to have something that's sturdy and I feel the last half of this movie is just all over the place but anyway this isn't a spoiler review so it's it's hard it's gonna be hard for you to believe this especially as you watch the first half of the movie which is so freakin amazing you'll be like how could this go wrong and then you'll be like oh yeah I see what you're talking about now it's kind of shocking how little answers you get you're like you're not gonna really explain any of it alright so Pele has put out there that he has given some thought while making this movie to the duality of the black experience his words are not mine in America I think that that's I don't really see that reflected anywhere in the movie I think he's just kind of pushing the mentality of people who are seeing it in that direction being like you're like what is this about Jordan he's like you know what it might be about and I'm like make a commitment I think non-committal I think it's a very good way to describe this movie in terms of what it's what it's about right because as I said that's barely represented in the script beyond the central conceit that's what I get for trying to use a big vocabulary word the central idea of people discovering that they have duplicates right in fact if this was truly a movie about duality including the black experience in America and even beyond that because I think duality is a concept that everyone can relate to and everyone would want to confront right then that would permeate every aspect of the characters and the story that's how you make a movie about duality and this is not that a bottom line as I said Pele puts together a first half of a movie that's pretty much perfect and then the thing just starts to unravel significantly and quite quickly until it just stops with a non ending like movies over and you're like really hmm I think whether or not you love us and some people love it to be fair depends on two things one you don't see the other end twists coming I figured it out about 15 minutes into the movie so the big reveal couldn't distract me from the third act problems and I suspect it well for many others and two if you can successfully project your own social commentary of choice under the moon then you're gonna obviously be like I love this movie it represents everything that I wanted to represent because Jordan Peele just made a really loose construct for you to do with what you will but again as I said to me I think the film is just so non-committal I don't really feel you can reward a film for being so likes so non-committal like it's not a it's like I almost feel like it's refusing to take a stand rather than being a tool for you to use it's like you can do that I don't think so I don't see how it can have a message if there's really just nothing there to build on I mean it's it requires so much projection the message is entirely personally generated and I guess you know that is a valid form of art one could say like abstract art but uh it's it's not very rewarding in my opinion as if it's a piece of entertainment we'll talk about the entertainment value of the movie in just a moment but one other thing I want to add is that I thought the film for the first half of it was really progressive in that Lupita Nyong'o gets to play a Toni Collette hereditary type role and Winston Duke gets to play and both of them do it quite well Winston Duke is like a Clark Griswold type dad I thought that was so wonderful so if us though it turns out is going to be more about you know race politics right and Nyong'o and Duke in these roles is more a commentary than them legitimately just getting these roles and acing them well I mean it's like are they actually I guess what I'm trying to say it's like are they actually just playing these characters is it that kind of cool opportunity for them or they like what you know black actors ironically playing these roles I don't like that I don't like the latter I think the former to me is really exciting and the latter is like I think arguably less progressive but okay so all this aside how was the movie as a piece of entertainment well I think it's wildly entertaining for the first half as I said perfect and well peel his writing needs some work some he might be like god damn it grace peel us an Oscar he's very good at coming up with an idea as I said at the beginning of this review and also don't forget the Oscars are very political and they sometimes you know democratically dole out awards to different films and really the best the best Oscar forget out to receive was for writing and it allowed the Academy to give Jordan peel something for his work even though he just could not win in other categories because again the politics of it all but I think his writing needs some work but damn has he quickly evolved into a master director the opening sequence of us has to be seen the opening scene is so good that it races the entire film up to such a high degree that it carries the entire rest of it even the third act you're like yeah this is not great but I just I still have that opening in my mind it was so good I'll tell you how good it was when I went to film school I had this professor who taught us filmmaking by just having us watch sequences from Spielberg's jaws again and again this sequence is that good so one I can't wait to see it again I don't know I didn't even as you can see I have major problems with the film and I'm excited to see it again I don't have my tickets then all the way through the Wilsons leaving their neighbors home about halfway through again the movie is shockingly good like in terms of the shining when it comes to being well constructed I love by the way that Jordan Peele has been walking around doing interviews dressed as Jack Torrance from the shining and intentionally it's so smart he loves Easter eggs this movie has tons of Easter eggs in it and that and then in that regard it's a little bit like scream and then it's very clever and meta both in terms of pop culture but I also really liked that it had a lot of nods to african-american history and culture which I thought was a really nice touch again it's not really a message but it's again really cool Easter eggs and I think gives the film I think not only a level of authenticity but I felt like legitimacy again they are not ironically playing these roles it's really about this really nice family and this is the types of things they would have in their home like for instance like from a Howard sweatshirt to Alvin Ailey Dance posters I thought that was great the movie is also terrifying so scary I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to scary movies as you know but I hit my eyes a lot and the idea of being attacked by yourself is truly disturbing like you kind of get an idea in the trailers but trust me you have no real idea of how disturbing it is until you see this movie and it's heightened by the entire casts fantastic ability to hypnotically play to very different sides of the same coin I was like wow you really are like very different I love it and while everyone in the cast does a great job this is truly Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Dukes film their performances are truly captivating funny and charming and they both come across like true movie stars I love it I also love the Wilson family as a whole and their likability relatability and spunk you'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie I think helps to soften the blow as the film or disappointment let's say as the film begins to unravel you're like ah but at least I'm still with the Wilson so what a cool family and we'll talk about all that the unraveling and the spoiler review but as I tweeted earlier today despite being deeply flawed I feel that the first half of us is so good that it truly is a must st. so that's my review of us my
