hello youtubers this is Sheridan Davis again and welcome to pretty dicey and girls PG,0.14047445
ok I am coming today to do a movie review for the film Selma iris,0.078505225
lee it came out maybe two weeks ago I think everybody should go out to,0.08516643
see this movie I get an A and the direct I loved her work she,0.08514404
is also the one she speeds up and slows down things I love it so,0.12583001
make sure you guys go out and see something i have on a coat because,0.19594763
I'm so um anyway so everybody go see summer it was very good now when,0.06621718
you go see make sure you have tissues ready honey cuz i cried and i'm,0.31609368
not one of those people just cry at movies a lot behind I was in,0.22660325
tears the first five minutes of this film like I was like bad when you,0.15451011
like that man in tears like the first time thinking like maybe I shouldn't do,0.13136315
this review but then I thought yes I should it its history it's not like,0.098427154
I'm selling a film yeah by the ship pretty much caught what happened so anyway,0.07476861
what one thing that idea learned about the film is that they highlighted the women,0.14998801
in the movement so like obviously Chris got King this Nash Ralph Abernathy is wife,0.22840877
you know things people liked it so I was super excited that she um that,0.19145791
they highlighted the women because i oftentimes when you hear about civil rights like we,0.26489323
only think about the me and plus rosa parks slider and there were other women,0.15397806
who were involved in this struggle and in history you know with these marches and,0.05794547
things of that nature and sometimes even if they weren't on the front lines they,0.06372372
were organizers they were getting ideas they're giving the talents all that so i think,0.10430433
we often we do need to give them their activation and who are not dr.,0.13823986
king give him them Escalades as well you know not to take anything from him,0.19211185
but he wasn't after about himself so I think it's amazing to just give these,0.09922445
people highlight them if you say it was so much action in this film but,0.083206214
it will make you because of where we are now in history it'll make you,0.06295611
appreciate where we are be grateful for those who have come before us and it'll,0.06911442
make you know that we can't overcome like we have made some get strikes in,0.15205552
this country we have a lot more to do so it made me appreciate feel,0.09099921
it made me know that the air gardeners Trayvon Martin my ground situations that we,0.06013871
cannot become them too and I know that we have had a difficult past with,0.059197567
racism in this country you know with I watched it with my best friend and,0.44419935
we were sitting there thinking like man God truly it's awesome because he clearly selects,0.14882565
when we were all born like he chooses the right people to be worn at,0.20254998
the right time because i was thinking like if i were born during that time,0.09948221
when I have been able to march with them like what I have been able,0.08024532
to like stay in that race like what I have been able to be nonviolent,0.31383285
I don't think I'd have been able to do that I don't know if I,0.0983122
would have had the courage to be able to not slap a police officer at,0.1297704
ease let me or tonight um you know challenge a police officer who called me,0.2700537
girl and now i'ma 40 year old woman you know so I think those things,0.28915083
are really important just to see like how far we have them and like it's,0.0711223
just crazy to me to think about the fact that man beast is not just,0.34523097
a movie that's not just a story that came out of someone's butt this is,0.69542736
history this stuff really heavy and it didn't happen that long ago because these folks,0.10918013
are still alive like a lot of you people are still alive to talk about,0.25355086
what they did and some of them weren't kids like 16 17 18 years old,0.15592055
and for them to have their college at that type of them to have that,0.075723566
courage to march and not just to march and that's one thing i love about,0.07882255
this that error they weren't just marching to be marching because i found that a,0.07055859
lot of us are marching to be marching but we didn't march they talk to,0.03948489
legislators they were talking to people who can actually make differences like if you're marching,0.081923805
with nothing Andy no um no attention all media attention no attention from your government,0.14885834
where they flip state local or federal we're just taking a walk and saying nothing,0.10835642
talking about saying nothing but I love that they have some force behind them they,0.23120084
were talking to the president they had something they had some but there's nothing else,0.10542982
I can take away from this family it's something that the Bible says faith when,0.1415821
our works is dead so no we're not just marching but we're marching for change,0.10509092
and we're not just march and we're getting everybody involved and i also look because,0.06104453
we cannot in school these days we are off we kind of thought that everybody,0.101751894
was with dr. King on Malcolm X and that is not how it went lips,0.087519564
and I history way and if you go back and research you'll find that you,0.09658189
know we always talk about black people being United and you know everybody has a,0.40327114
different mind it was not going to think like you and so there were several,0.14984912
leaders right several leaders different races different sexes different colors I don't everybody one way,0.24111812
dr. King if I did not agree with dr. king he was not the spokesman,0.08955577
for the entire Negro race there were other leaders but i did use him you,0.6345427
know despite his flaws and his moral issues God used him mightily and I think,0.27454728
that's a great thing to point out I want to have his daughter you know,0.25235498
so she was at the Opera screening of this film I wonder how she felt,0.12077204
watching this you know it can't I mean he is deceased iris lee but it,0.19363667
can't be a good feeling to know that the FBI has you know half pounds,0.14364085
of your father shooting on your mother like I wonder have that feels is there,0.8465248
a filament he's being passed along I wonder if her mother and we talked to,0.24030139
them about it was there something that or if she ever dealt with it or,0.09371931
is it something that she just like trying to like not talk about not deal,0.14962289
with in order to say the movement and what to keep her family you know,0.19257908
because she could have left I wonder how this my history would have been had,0.11625913
these wonder who are on the front line with their hello who were fighting with,0.1246763
their heads when during these movements and their husbands were stepping out on them I,0.24153292
wonder how different history would have been if those one would have left them because,0.07542499
they had grounds to leave them I wonder how and being like it's careta diverse,0.104738
nothing like what we have been able to what he still had been used as,0.091119505
he was like when he still had been a prominent figure that he looked i,0.08204094
really wonder it so I don't know it was a really great movie I think,0.10082061
everybody needs to go see all the african-american me to go see it man forget,0.46457538
about I don't want to see the word stand black movies like honestly honestly there,0.40332574
are not the Moon moves out about our history we don't make that any movies,0.0776223
period through the year so we need to go see it and supply if we,0.05452703
want these actors to stay in Hollywood we want Holly watch your continued to an,0.15508059
hour store everything we need to go support our people and let me say this,0.16560577
as well I am so disappointed in the Academy Awards I am not watching it,0.070806324
I am not watching it for there to be no people of color nominated for,0.49432722
their acting I think that is utterly ridiculous data or yellow desirable nomination for this,0.48053917
movie as far as I'm concerned so that the young man who play I who,0.08686175
play a James Brown you know there were other movies who are deserving of Oscar,0.0651301
nominations they had oscar-worthy performance if nothing else James Brown will should have been nominated,0.11932956
for a costume and makeup honestly I am disappointed Academy Awards you guys I'm horrible,0.32444343
animation up since it's a hug it's a racial ballgame period point blank because you're,0.41924798
kind of saying then no african-american no Asian American or Latino American actors and actresses,0.25879622
our desire of ice cuz this year's no matter how how good of performances they,0.08296693
cool during the box offices or on the big screen I do not appreciate it,0.09121672
so Academy I can go sit down I will not be watching out this year,0.11441803
I hope that I only hope that Selma Texas the way this oscar for best,0.13525493
friend but it's not and um it should have been nominated for best director as,0.09204877
well but whatever i'm not doing this we can take away yet i'm just not,0.08500642
