I realize that the propaganda war movies in Hollywood was making during the 1940s we're,0.047004536
not a good idea right that's that's not good for anyone although of course when,0.041250035
you see what Christopher Nolan has done here you understand why they did that because,0.028995356
I think that hooker boy the pendulum has totally swung too far in the other,0.62618107
direction with this film and I am genuinely shocked at the way Christopher Nolan has,0.014475062
decided to portray British soldiers in this film he's British why would he send us,0.06803365
about his own military and his fellow citizens who who put their lives on the,0.03800793
line to protect England I mean it's just absolutely incredible as I tweeted he swaps,0.039135415
Band of Brothers you know that idea for world war ii with every man for,0.11103644
himself and some people when i tweeted that row like well that's what it was,0.02537742
like grace it was really tough out there you know it was all about survival,0.023791624
particularly at Dunkirk but I'm talking about every man for himself against fellow soldiers against,0.031201769
allies against civilians I mean after this movie if you saw a British soldier you,0.16493295
would be like I don't know if I'd make it out of this encounter alive,0.23544918
because that person is all that for himself and I realized that there might be,0.035788875
some soldiers like that but to to say that all soldiers are that way I,0.038944505
think it's really a disservice to the incredibly heroic and kind majority of soldiers that,0.102808125
exist which we know because of the stories and the medals and the real stories,0.019686775
this is a fiction so the fact that it would try and change that narrative,0.03351129
to me is really odd and there were two deaths in the movie in particular,0.085352376
that really bothered me you'll know when you see him and actually even made me,0.040379975
angry because neither one had to happen and it shouldn't have happened they were both,0.021686317
just cold human cruelty and selfishness for British soldiers against people it was just crazy,0.3187983
and again this is fiction nolan wrote this and if he's going to portray british,0.15597957
soldiers in this manner he better damn well back it up i'm very curious to,0.25608304
hear how people feel about this down in the comments who have a military background,0.015044458
are currently involved in the military both if you're overseas and if you're an American,0.05545104
military person I think in May I'm just I really curious to see what the,0.02780135
reaction is because mine was not good now no one of course wants an Oscar,0.021094969
and he clearly was aiming for Spielberg Cameron territory here to fellow wildly successful directors,0.049236227
commercially who were ignored by the Academy until Saving Private Ryan and Titanic but instead,0.0401292
because of the flaws that have kept Nolan from being nominated to date and he,0.022862362
just can't help himself you know I'm surprised he wasn't more self-aware to figure out,0.03862189
what the problems where it's hard to be it's hard to do that anyway I,0.07186644
think he should have studied Spielberg and Cameron more carefully but instead of going in,0.057837717
their direction he ended up going Mallik Terrence Malick The Thin Red Line specifically mixed,0.19379593
with Pixar and I'm not talking early Pixar I'm talking you know the really obvious,0.040629417
Pixar of today that is aggressively bleak and emotionally manipulative like I was watching this,0.13413428
movie and I'm like oh I bet this is going to happen now because that,0.05022735
would just make this even sadder then I was like oh yeah I did okay,0.06478423
on and till you but you don't cry can you just annoy and it just,0.13059351
makes everybody in the movie unlikable now I'm sure some of you right now like,0.09122728
but I like the thin red line Greg you're horrible why aren't you more self-aware,0.34143874
I know you guys well some of you we don't want to paint everybody with,0.049959283
the same brush like Nolan does right and that's great I'm glad you like the,0.036561154
Thin Red Line but the film was not successful with mainstream audiences it made just,0.022314915
like 36 million dollars domestic and this one will obviously do much better than that,0.027502017
because it's a Christian for Nolan movie and it's so well reviewed and has all,0.16578771
this Oscar talk we'll get to that in a moment but I do suspect will,0.023471005
be one of his least successful because I think that a lot of people in,0.06733189
Middle America will not like it I mean people who like American sniper aren't going,0.35014772
to like this movie I'm sure some of you are like well I hate it,0.35944512
in there I mean war divides people and we'll see we'll see how in box,0.26272592
office dollars how many people like this really bleak negative portrayal of it with all,0.05531667
the heroics isn't sucked out of it and kindness I also think that it won't,0.12841836
be successful just for some other reasons there's hardly any dialogue and oh the dialogue,0.027444147
they do have it's very hard to hear like an remember an interstellar Michael Caine,0.05567853
he was like I have diseases we really important to you and like everybody in,0.13481942
the theater was like woody say did you understand it that happens for a number,0.031703983
of lines here as well although I'm going to get the shout out to the,0.07763026
sound design person in a moment mostly for the vs the the sound effects also,0.023971222
we use a nonlinear storytelling device three different stories to take place over different periods,0.038508147
of time like a week like two days or something in an hour or a,0.01858124
day in an hour and they don't make it very it's very hard to follow,0.045723394
and I don't think it pays off even or not at the end of the,0.037970677
movie you're not like oh that's why you did that good show you're like yeah,0.12585807
you could have just totally got rid of that and then also let's just again,0.24661323
very aggressively bleak and negative and its portrayal of soldiers I was also surprised that,0.054652818
upend hardly any attention to the civilians who willingly drove their boats their tiny little,0.073446915
boats into a war zone that's the narrative hook for this movie the Dunkirk story,0.04781739
Spielberg and Cameron would have recognized this and you know that's where Nolan messed up,0.031193787
I think and that's why I think it's going to ultimately cost him the Oscar,0.030321065
and I will talk to you more about that just a moment when we get,0.023435751
to know himself but interestingly a movie came out just a few months ago called,0.02883172
world's finest from the UK as well Chris Nolan's British and not understood that was,0.09467426
the angle that was the human interest angle that's the word of the Dunkirk story,0.020892752
and this movie doesn't do that I think that Spielberg and Cameron would have realized,0.040520992
that what you need to do is to get the audience watching the movie to,0.02010584
ask themselves they would do such a thing today let's say the military was like,0.020658609
you know whatever country you're in your government said we have soldiers stranded behind enemy,0.11153068
lines and none of our vehicles for some reason are working we need you to,0.010607018
drive your own car and pick up a bunch of them would you do it,0.073394366
what you know in an active war zone where you were in mortal danger and,0.092610195
from soldiers to - well as you'll see in this movie but anyway I will,0.051377453
say to be fair that this is a stunning achievement when it comes to the,0.019282343
film craftsmanship outside of storytelling in fact think this is the best that no one,0.055987842
has ever achieved in that regard and I have no doubt that this one will,0.021428226
be nominated for numerous awards particularly in those categories also its IMAX cinematography alone is,0.029780272
revolutionary and if you are going to see this film you would be doing yourself,0.23300885
a disservice not to see it in the IMAX format a real IMAX not a,0.06418955
fake baby IMAX I mean it just fills it the whole screen and it's just,0.25624272
a breathtaking picture it was truly it was truly an experience in every sense of,0.039166015
the word and I think it gives the movie a lot of leeway especially toward,0.03593322
the beginning until you just crumpled under the bleakness of it and the ability to,0.17609075
follow the story I also feel it Hans Zimmer who I just finished the other,0.034656733
day saying has never produced a score that I think is particularly memorable he does,0.040549595
his best work ever here I mean in fact I think the movie succeeds because,0.032108415
of Zimmer score points in who attend with cinematography and Richard Kings sound design specifically,0.04018707
the sound effects it's just a really good trio they do they do amazing work,0.034710612
and then I think for best score back to best score right now I would,0.03899107
say that the Oscar you know award season it's going to right now it's between,0.015317849
Zimmer and Michael chiquinho for warfare the Planet of the Apes the the work they,0.22591512
both do is career-defining I feel there's a chance that Noland still won't be nominated,0.021272574
here though for director I think that could be the case or you'll be nominated,0.028682718
and I don't think I think for sure he won't win unless things get political,0.04741828
unless everybody decides that it's time for Nolan to win another Best directing Oscar but,0.018989664
I think this film especially because you have to consider that so many people who,0.045554437
are trying to change the voter ship particularly to the Academy Awards a lot of,0.01604556
them are from the greatest generation I think they would be particularly offended by the,0.08715502
way those soldiers are portrayed and he should have thought of that when it was,0.01968877
making the movie how every Weinstein whatever although he's not doing through all these days,0.06011597
either available no one is not just the director but also the writer so it's,0.0063664727
his fault that the film misses the mark storytelling lies both in terms of the,0.056076977
ability to follow it and also emotional payoff and engagement so those are the reasons,0.032868054
he usually has it nominated so he still has the exact same problem now acting,0.029308656
wise there's nothing Tom Hardy can't do he's just such a profession it's a joy,0.033749424
to watch him work he's not asked to do much here I mean this is,0.05454506
the kind of role that he could do in asleep and be warned he has,0.053486086
a very very small roll back most people list movie have a very small role,0.0366004
and again when they are on screen there's no dialogue for the most part so,0.014562201
you have to look at the actors most of the time and in that regard,0.0177471
Hardy's fellow pilot played by Jack Loudoun was really cool looking he had this really,0.028508442
old-fashioned bunch of 1940s Michael J Fox look like it was just like you were,0.281335
like oh you don't really see that anymore I mean he's just perfect for the,0.045572396
movie so he just looked great I really thought he was fantastic I can't tell,0.05126105
you how good of an actor it was because it was gonna have to do,0.059868522
very much acting but he was better than Harry Styles I'm sorry to say because,0.026491605
I was really excited about Harry Styles in this movie I was like oh he's,0.03687911
gonna be bigger than Justin Timberlake why isn't he in the trailer more I know,0.021087652
why he wasn't in the trailer more he's not a good actor I never once,0.09924673
believed he was in any real danger or was actually at war especially when he,0.084658585
was next to his co-stars you were like ah those guys seem really just in,0.038026553
despair you know Harry Styles was that he was just told to seem like he,0.018444877
was in despair and he was doing the best he could also he played such,0.029156994
a despicable human being that if I were his management team I really would have,0.26194155
advised him against taking a role I know it's Nolan but I think he did,0.056905795
not come out particularly well I mean I his fans will still love him but,0.07693181
anyone who's new to Harry Styles would be like that jerk from Dunkirk ah now,0.50506246
I know a lot of you won't be able to resist seeing this film partially,0.061506204
because the number of you won't believe that what I'm saying is true because of,0.03179245
Nolan's reputation in fact when I was walking out of the theater I asked another,0.032784242
critic that I've seen it number numerous screenings I said would you think of the,0.014300783
movie he said I liked it of course but it's like like who could dare,0.052447736
not love a Christopher Nolan movie like why add me of course it was was,0.052508265
very to me because I hated it so much Emperor's New Clothes kind of a,0.10512762
mentality oh I similar problems with baby driver in fact and I think if you,0.17308743
like baby driver you might like Dunkirk maybe you know I'll put you in that,0.24697123
category as a movie goer in the first 45 minutes of the movie or so,0.019527132
are very good because they're so over the technical craftsmanship and so again you're like,0.0221127
oh it's pretty good and like it's bad but I could also tell you though,0.04384824
that I had plans to see it again on Sunday night but I cancelled them,0.1016966
after seeing the presque reading because I was like I just can't sit through this,0.03152771
movie again but I know that some of you could you've already seen it I've,0.024424214
enjoyed it and I'm sure that many more will enjoy it but I think many,0.02452133
and more will also agree with me so let's keep it civil in the comment,0.021987645
section down below as we discuss our differing opinions on Dunkirk and also try to,0.060220405
see it not just from your perspective but it's lighted you know from an awards,0.022581654
perspective do you think it'll do well during award season and not just because you,0.022448618
think it deserves an Oscar but knowing how the Academy votes who votes etcetera the,0.05326591
politics of it all try and keep that in mind as well and their history,0.043578178
of voting the patterns that have emerged all right thank you so much for tuning,0.026180297
