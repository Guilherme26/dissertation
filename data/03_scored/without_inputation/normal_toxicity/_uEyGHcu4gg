the three main actors are the best reason to watch this,0.07162367
I thought Gene Kelly was good Julie Andrews was good but I felt like my standout was Donnell O'Connor as Cosmo Brown I just felt like any time he was on screen eight elevated the movie a little bit more maybe more interested and I thought the story was good it was definitely easy to follow along with now on to the negatives even though Julie Andrews was good I just felt like she could have done a little bit more,0.07215928
and another big problem of mine is that the even though the movie to a lot of people,0.15014742
it's considered classic to me it just isn't very memorable,0.10073346
and it's not a movie that I would really watch that many more times and it's just yeah there's just nothing very remarkable in the story it seemed just like you knew where it was going and all that overall I'm going to give this a three and a half out of five,0.08102991
