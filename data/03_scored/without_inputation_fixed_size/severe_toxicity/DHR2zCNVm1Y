hi Shane here you're watching Sam for God's this is March check around so hi,0.02687741
guys how you doing today I will talk about a film that I've been wanting,0.077002324
and waiting to see for so long I can't speak to how excited I was,0.036315702
for it to finally come out of the UK because it came out in the,0.12821215
UK about a month and a half dated in America which what is this like,0.047561962
why does America get everything early anyway I'm the 24th of July 2015 Pixar's new,0.024104925
film inside out finally came out of the UK and I went to watch it,0.09846581
that same day it was a Friday and I absolutely loved it okay so if,0.036160715
you've read anything about inside out you'd probably know that this film has been getting,0.078761734
positive reviews after positive reviews after positive reviews hardly anyone in fact there having been,0.015321175
a single negative review about this movie and so I was very excited about seeing,0.070410356
it because I was like whoa everybody is giving this film like amazing reviews I,0.07242586
was also a bit apprehensive because I was like surely there must be at least,0.11537943
something wrong with a film like this movie can't be so good that no one,0.0643339
said anything bad about it so I went in hoping for the best but also,0.03502591
being open to things I didn't like in the film there weren't any the film,0.017044665
is perfect if you didn't know inside-out is about a girl called Riley she's like,0.0908581
11 or something and she moves away she moves from like one place to another,0.1408094
to another state or whatever she actually moved to San Francisco which I thought was,0.017246217
really cool because I've been San Francisco I mean like San Francisco so it was,0.026266107
cool to see that in the film but she doesn't like it fair enough you,0.052964583
know she's young it's not really easy moving from one place to another because like,0.04385822
she didn't have her friends anymore she doesn't live in her old house where she,0.07188706
liked her room and whatnot so the whole room is a bit difficult on her,0.07687128
and yeah basically if we go inside Whitey's brain and find out how her brain,0.5292368
is controlled doing this move it's genius it's the coolest thing basically the main characters,0.03492547
in the film involve characters like joy and sadness and anger and fear and disgust,0.11108966
and the movie is just so unique so original and I honestly wasn't sure how,0.025563672
they were gonna play out like because they is quite difficult you know you go,0.035542756
back and forth between seeing Riley in her life and then seeing the emotions in,0.0421181
her brain but they did a great job at it like there were no moments,0.20115153
of boredom no moments of confusion it was just done very very well what I,0.035066485
love most about the film is that it's just so clever and it's so deep,0.021660374
it's so meaningful there are so many underlying themes go on and it's something that,0.019128686
I genuinely think adults would enjoy more than children like kids can go and watch,0.23279418
the film and like it because it's entertaining and funny and there's loads of colors,0.038931202
in the film but they probably won't understand the deeper meanings behind the film and,0.0162072
those are the things that adults going to watch the film would notice and they'd,0.015394345
be amazed by them like I was if you're actually in psychology even just a,0.05006305
little bit you're gonna love this film because it just goes inside your brain and,0.39107764
it explains how brains work in a very unique way obviously that's not necessarily how,0.07793424
brains actually work this is fiction this is a fictional story it's a fictional film,0.071679525
but it's just so clever and unique and amazing ingenious how they've come up with,0.022754602
this system like it's a whole system in your head according to this film and,0.11907918
all these emotions are like characters who like have to work hard every day to,0.023349276
make sure you know your levels of emotions are like balance and everything oh I,0.023767676
just loved it so much every single character in the film and there's loads of,0.014190363
them was great to watch there weren't any annoying people there's actually one character called,0.1313618
Bing bong and he easily could have been annoying like I remember watching him at,0.06993541
some point and thinking to myself why am I not annoyed that this character because,0.02187789
he did some things and he said some things that could have become a bit,0.029192915
annoying but somehow they don't seem annoying like you still absolutely love Bing bong and,0.18836737
Bing bong the character Bing bong is actually one of the reasons that I cried,0.022426002
a lot during the film because there are some emotional sad moments I'm not going,0.022690745
to spoil for you but yeah there was one point involving Bing bong that made,0.03116851
me literally cry like a baby it was ugly crying it was the most I've,0.3256447
cried missing him in a very long time they've got joy is probably my favorite,0.053718902
character just because I related to her I'm somebody who normally likes even very happy,0.0249384
and joyful and tries to see the best in every situation and tries to make,0.021577893
everyone feel happy like I don't like sadness which is kind of what joy is,0.03628976
about the character of joy of the feeling of joy and to like whenever something,0.016855089
sad all that happens instead of like being sad I like to avoid it and,0.060633484
like tell people to not be sad and just be happy again which in the,0.15493457
film you learn that that's not necessarily the best thing to do sometimes you need,0.054055482
sadness you know in your life sometimes it's good to have a bit of a,0.08012736
cry or just feel sad for a while oh it's just so clever thinking about,0.044309214
it just makes me you think like whoa it was amazing sadness has the character,0.032669164
was was awesome again she does quite a lot of annoying things in the film,0.09659465
like in the beginning I was like I'm not sure if I'm gonna like her,0.05725701
but as a film went on I was like she's awesome she's apps the awesome,0.032962512
she made me laugh a lot she was just the voice I'm acting as well,0.113420464
as done really well in the film throughout the whole film every single character was,0.008070673
brilliant there isn't a villain in the film which is another thing I like in,0.020392535
a lot of films especially kids films there always seems to be a villain that,0.06521128
the protagonist of the film has to go and fight against or something but inside,0.0343727
out does not have a villain they go on an adventure but the adventure doesn't,0.02959801
have to do anything with a villain it's just things happen and they get to,0.074138045
a point where they have to solve things basically I actually have some of their,0.016547108
inside-out characters with me right now in tsumtsum form so we've got joy over here,0.0563058
she looks pretty joyful they've got sadness she looks really sad lesser or blue and,0.2068189
sad this is fear it was actually one of the funnier characters in the film,0.01733136
they've got anger looks pretty angry I'd say and this guy's is Bing bong who,0.256626
I talked to you about earlier yep he's like a half elephant half something else,0.11170895
kind of thing I'm not gonna give anything away but yeah this is Bing bong,0.031388022
taking off steam assumes actually if you want me to do a tsumtsum collection video,0.17280607
at some point do you leave a comment down below and let me know anyway,0.07712671
back to the film um honestly I was so amazed by it I loved it,0.02198565
so much I loved so much there are so many funny moments in the film,0.03223613
so many great lines for visuals are just amazing like ah Pixar Pixar just knows,0.013731386
how to make films like I'm probably one of the biggest Pixar fans out there,0.06493723
as much as I love Disney with Pixar it's just something else I've always preferred,0.034414608
what Pixar do to what Disney does without big star and they just did it,0.035071142
with this film like it's been a long time since Pixar Sports out of film,0.06991546
that's good as inside out I will say it's probably as good as Toy Story,0.06731792
1 or at least nearly as good as that and that's a lot coming for,0.024543947
me because I adore Toy Story I think it's one of the best films ever,0.06608999
made be it inside out especially in terms of originality and uniqueness is probably Pixar's,0.035901956
best film I'd say it was just awesome I could not find any faults with,0.050937768
their like just go and see it please go and see it I mean you,0.059849232
don't really need me to tell you to go and see you probably already have,0.038643178
seen it yourself because it's doing really well everyone's saying good thing about it but,0.054342177
even if you're not a fan of Disney and Pixar give this one the girl,0.07431964
because it played with my emotions I cried I laughed it was just for me,0.040701922
I say he's probably the best film I've seen in 2015 and I've seen a,0.013293695
lot of films this year like I don't know if you remember or not but,0.027805341
one of my name is resolutions was to watch as many films as I could,0.034751188
this year and I have my mom's a member in the cinema the cinema so,0.10302298

since January of this year different kinds of films have been join us and stuff,0.027462106
but oh my god inside that was the best one I've seen so far it's,0.027575187
definitely gonna be an Oscar like no doubt it was just done so cleverly like,0.035113048
I came home and I could not stop thinking about it and I loved every,0.07601785
single character and also I want to mention lava as well lava was the short,0.020373244
Pixar film before inside out in case you didn't know any Pixar film that comes,0.049234234

you've seen the film if you've seen things I haven't seen are but you know,0.02053688
which is on I'm talking about but the whole short film is basically taught through,0.020624684
a song a ukulele song a very simple song but a very effective and cute,0.045035593
song and that goes something like I have a dream I'm not going to sing,0.058689155
it for you but just look it up if you want but it's such a,0.03434809
cute song and it's a very basic story which is why I don't thing is,0.02707763
one of the best short Pixar films and because normally you know the short film,0.057835057
short because of films have a twist and there was something just one didn't you,0.02493574
have a twist it was quite predictable but it was still so cute I felt,0.044324514
