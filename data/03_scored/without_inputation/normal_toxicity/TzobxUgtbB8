all right,0.052336607
so I just got out of the quiet place or a quiet place sorry a quiet place and before I get into anything any kind of specifics obviously as per usual beginning of the review no real spoilers,0.12071622
and then I'll be very clear,0.042896595
when I say that there's going to be some form of spoiler but before I get into it,0.0711308
I just want to say go see this movie like this is the best movie I've seen in ages possibly in in like years like obviously those movies that have come out that are like that I love that are like Marvel movies or just like you know fun movies and stuff like this and stuff like that,0.11669095
but this movie has hit me harder than and then any movie in a really long time for being kind of like a horror movie it hit me in the same kind of way that something like The Green Mile would hit you in terms of like an emotional scale,0.31089434
but also an addendum to that if you don't do well with tension at all like if you're somebody who really can't handle any kind of tension,0.15126766
hi rocket,0.06151585
maybe don't go see this movie or at least wait until it's like you can watch it at home and kind of separate yourself from the moment obviously when you're in a theater,0.11770981
it's very hard to to exit to pull yourself out of a situation to do something to kind of remove yourself from like negative feeling emotion,0.48054215
he knows my face is red I'm gonna get into that this was like my job,0.26376423
it was just either way,0.03759887
it was it was very very very good,0.06433552
so for those of you who don't know a quiet place is a movie that was directed by John Krasinski,0.18621449
and if that name sounds familiar it's because he played Jim in the office yeah that's right Jim from the office is now making really really serious movies and well some of you might be like isn't it isn't it just a horror movie isn't it just like a run-of-the-mill kind of horror movie it is so much more than that this movie managed to build tension and character development,0.1498343
in like such an absolutely amazing way that you're like right from the get-go you care about all the characters you care about their well-being,0.11107033
and it just it just continues that tension bill just the entire time it's I honestly can't think of a movie that did it in a better way,0.06892572
the last time I saw a horror movie that kind of had that level of tension and intensity it would have been it follows,0.09645516
but this goes so far beyond that in such a beautifully amazing way which is kind of interesting to save for the stuff movie is if you guys saw the trailers just to give you a basic rundown you just you get the idea that something has happened to humanity we're kind of a little bit into the future probably not too distantly in the future,0.09283857
well yeah I know for a fact it's not too distantly in the future,0.06427488
but some things happen and basically humanity's in a state where you you can't make any noise if you make noise things attack you,0.4051188
and obviously the movie goes through,0.08430511
oh it doesn't go too far into detail,0.11581473
doesn't it doesn't do,0.055949997
one of those like de0 type things and build it into what led to where they are now really it picks up about like 89 days into whatever,0.07626011
this disaster is it tells you right like it actually says it right on the screen it pretty much picks up 89 days into probably what I would presume would be the first incident or whatever happens and it doesn't it doesn't pander it,0.101151384
it doesn't go over it for too long,0.09993711
you basically just rocket you basically just see kind of like posters like oh like newspaper articles lying around that kind of tell you with a brief idea of what happened,0.34338993
but then basically it's just John Krasinski and his family are trying to survive through this ordeal,0.0903137
and John Krasinski specifically describes it as being for his kids,0.109693065
and I was when I heard him say that in an interview I was like this is kind of looks like a pretty scary horror moving its horas kids,0.35829318
but I guess the idea is is that it's supposed to show exactly how far he or you know a father or a mother would go to protect their children to go to protect their family,0.06702877
so it was just kind of like an ode to them and honestly when you see it you'll you'll be like wow that's that's really spot-on,0.0799434
so it's it's very it's very simple in nature,0.06787274
when comparing it to something like annihilation just because similar undertones obviously annihilation is way more of like a sci-fi focused adventure,0.3013383
this kind of just has a sci-fi undertone to it,0.06917355
but you this is way more of a self-contained story and while there is clearly a larger scale thing happening in the world you are very much just focused on this one family and what they're going through and and how they're trying to get not out of the situation but just try to live through the situation,0.10713823
so I would 100% recommend it even if you're not necessarily a horror fan if as long as you don't hate horror as long as you don't hate tension,0.16752918
I would definitely recommend going to see this in theaters,0.10499024
because I honestly believe that this should be supported I think John Krasinski did an amazing job I'm a huge fan of the office and I had a really hard time seeing characters in the office outside those roles or at least outside comedy roles especially somebody like John Krasinski,0.053588007
it's very hard to see him as anything other than you know in gym and and this movie totally totally you know just just kicks kicks that out of me,0.53490317
and his wife in the movies actually his wife in real life Emily Blunt and that itself seemed to just really add to things,0.118920706
it was just like a very beautiful project and to know that he was involved in writing the screenplay to know that he directed it and just really put it all together and how beautifully it was shot and how like the cinematography and just like little little things that happen in every scene and how it was directed and flow flowed as a movie it was actually so amazingly well done and obviously you had some jump scares but it didn't really go for anything,0.116913185
cheap,0.22365457
it kept,0.04277775
you kind of on your toes the entire time because you had something like you've got a horror movie where the whole point is that people can't make noise so you figured they so that tension that normally gets built in horror movies when they stay quiet things down so they can jump scare you that doesn't always happen here because there's just so much silence because they there's just so there's actually one character that really exemplifies that silence even to to a higher degree,0.2290199
so because you can't rely on those usual,0.10946377
auditory cues that you would in a horror movie I honestly felt sick for like the first hour of the movie and I know that sounds bad,0.2415242
but it's because I was so tense and just waiting for things to happen that I felt sick and I don't want to say that in a bad way I want to say that that means that the movie did such an incredible job building the scene building the tension just building that whole emotion in the viewer and it was everybody was the same way anytime anything little happened,0.07732813
like people were reacting,0.091573074
people were like putting putting their hands on their heads,0.7093121
just honestly just,0.031777184
so so amazing and it wasn't in like a cheap way that horror movie usually our that was just specifically going out of its way to like psyche Wow creep you out grossed you out it was all just done because it was like shot incredibly well acted incredibly well and you were just totally immersed in this world that they had created that John Krasinski and the other people had created and I honestly blown away by it it's definitely something I'm gonna buy on blu-ray because I want to support it,0.24120304
I want to support ideas like that things that are kind of unique and different,0.09149367
and just things that can take part of one genre and and blend it with under on I'm tearing up because it was so good like it was just such an emotional ride,0.08020976
it was amazing,0.06680872
so please definitely go see it if you have any kind of interest in it whatsoever,0.12667017
if you like horror movies if you like dramas,0.31555676
if you like just any kind of just like good movies just go check it out it was absolutely amazing,0.15869178
I think that it is going to be at the forefront of its Jennifer for many many years to come,0.056520842
I would say that like 10 Cloverfield Lane would have tried to have a similar feel to it but couldn't hit it on the same emotional scale like I think this is gonna be a forerunner in its category which is so unique in that genre and also very unique for something directed by somebody who came up in the world that's a comedy actor so absolutely incredible now we're going into a few more of the spoilers I'm gonna talk about things specifically that I really enjoyed that they did,0.08371838
so this is this is heavy,0.22606257
spoiler territory III honestly implore you if you have not seen the movie yet and you were planning on watching the movie just don't watch past this point,0.10695351
please don't watch past I never say this,0.09865527
but I'm actually like I would really encourage you to just click off this video,0.22370921
if you haven't seen the movie yet and you're planning on seeing the movie,0.0746743
please,0.054873075
click off this video,0.24470401
this is just me talking about things that I really like I like even if you are the type of person that likes to oilers,0.1692792
please just click off this video,0.260683
please,0.054873075
please,0.054873057
click off this video right,0.17337897
now okay we're going into them,0.11589074
so right from the get-go,0.06969376
you you kind of get the you know,0.2329591
what happened it just starts off and kind of like a drug store,0.112478845
one of the kids is sick,0.40330783
and they're just kind of looking for some kind of medicine that would help him with whatever he's sick with so at this point in time,0.2422817
it's you know mom dad,0.17511679
three kids sick kid a girl and a younger younger son there isn't being this moment where that kid except a toy the younger one picks up a toy has batteries in it and the they take it away from him,0.2421856
they take the batteries out,0.07231925
but then I leave the toy there,0.07607398
but then the daughter or the sister ends up just giving him back the toy but not the batteries,0.082425825
but then he grabs the batteries before,0.10619344
he's leaving and they're walking home,0.1037276
and for some reason he's at the back honestly that was probably the only not believable thing is that if this was that kind of world and you had the youngest son I'm pretty sure that even if you weren't carrying him he wouldn't be at the back you'd probably have him in the middle somewheres just because for one he's young too,0.123143
he seems to not fully grasp the severity of the situation,0.119992256
and he's like the smallest,0.1463849
one,0.052165568
he's more prone to walk off,0.24169849
and he's in behind,0.31089434
the sister who I didn't mention she's deaf she can't hear anything,0.25474823
and that actually adds a really interesting dynamic to the whole thing,0.05180924
because she can't hear she can't even necessarily tell how loud she's being she can't necessarily hear what things going on around her,0.18106921
so that's an interesting dynamic,0.06188781
but I feel like you wouldn't put the youngest kid behind the deaf child that's just my and he's like pretty young,0.29175335
I would say he's probably like five or six years old,0.119377635
he was pretty young demands of turning on the toy it starts,0.13788944
making noises and everything just,0.11404253
it's like that whole scene was shot so incredibly well everything just stops nobody's saying everything,0.2983712
everybody is just like you get it,0.15231897
you get a close-up on emily Blunt's face and like you can tell that she knows it's too,0.19159918
late John Krasinski is just flat out running just running to try to catch him and like when he's I don't even know from like like from here to the wall away from him,0.11985066
something it just crashes on the wood and grabs him and then it's done and like right there from the beginning,0.15289947
they established that nobody is safe not a single person in this family not a single person in this movie is safe,0.121470094
if they are willing to kill the youngest child nobody is safe in this movie so that's at 89 days in and then it cuts ahead to like 472 days in so it gives you about a little over a year in between when that happens and and later later on so right there that really set the tone for everything,0.27690217
that's set an emotional tone right from the beginning and then when it cuts ahead,0.06375767
you find out that you know mom's pregnant with another baby,0.5621388
and that whole thing is like what happens,0.09180353
when the baby is born the babies are allowed how are you gonna deal with it just just oh my god it's just dealt with so well and then there's obviously that deals with there's like a whole tension because the daughter blames herself,0.23485728
so that turns into its whole other dynamic and and oh my god and then you have like you know,0.11139676
John Krasinski as a father is trying to his best take care of his family provide for his family,0.10250364
but obviously he gets a little Stern because he's just trying to protect people and she kind of gets the idea that maybe he blames her for you know the son the son dying,0.2609763
but then the mom blames herself because she could have been carrying him,0.27315897
and it's just oh it's just such a good view tafolla dynamic as it as it goes through there and and that just because they take that kid dies so early on you're like okay absolutely nobody is safe,0.3445167
in this movie,0.07704352
so every little time,0.07818821
something would happen,0.0654744
you just be you'd be waiting it'd be like,0.15350537
there's like a TVs that showed everything going around on the perimeter and at one point she's watching you know John Krasinski's character you know going to get the other kids and you're like oh my god she's alone and she's just watching these tipi something's gonna come up behind her because it's like they're trying not to make noises so they don't shut doors they don't they don't do anything that can make that extra amount of noise,0.15260386
so when these things get into houses they just they can just walk in but it's they just usually don't because everything so they're completely blind,0.15530296
everything they do is based on sound in terms of the monsters themselves you find out they're aliens which I you know it's cool,0.28238025
they can go like that and pander,0.088062316
they didn't go into too much explanation,0.07364202
they just say they're heavily armored,0.08318529
so you can't really shoot at them,0.494861
nobody really knows what the weakness are,0.08793465
they can't see anything and literally,0.07580117
they're there,0.032626756
they just have super,0.03562258
hearing,0.065182224
so the second they can hear you they can basically find you,0.06518594
but otherwise you're not really a jeopardy from them,0.11954815
it's very it's very interesting,0.06359221
but I was actually surprised that they showed them and they showed them really early when when the kid gets attacked you see it you kind of get the idea what it looks like and then it progressively kind of shows you more what they look like as the movie went on more so than I thought but it's really so that they can kind of exemplify,0.15803759
what happened I actually really liked what the with the weakness ended up being,0.07538593
and it actually made like if you have something that can hear so incredibly well obviously something with high frequencies would probably bother it,0.11848588
so that was really cool,0.050068676
I like that it was self-contained,0.08795896
I like they you know he has a whiteboard with all the information they think there's three in the area by the end of the movie you're left in a situation where you think that okay they could probably take care of this,0.14557555
but there's like this super emotional moment with John Krasinski protecting the kids,0.09838902
and it's like I start crying in the theater thinking you better,0.15454537
right,0.04255815
now I want to cry and I'm like I said when I go see movies I try to feel whatever the director and the creators are trying to get you to feel if I feel like I'm gonna cry,0.09045346
I don't try to hold the tears back,0.08791204
I just let him happen because that's what they're trying to get you to feel,0.07376644
and yeah here I go I'm actually crying because it was that emotional,0.15550345
it was so amazing like I said certain parts of this movie really like the only other movie,0.112151235
I can think of that elicited this kind of emotional reaction was Green Mile and Green Mile is like one of the saddest movies in the world,0.16340819
and this is suppose to be a horror movie but it's just it's amazing,0.17690027
so I think that those were some of the really strong moments,0.06832509
I know this is the spoiler part but I'm really hesitant to even talk about more spoilers because I know some people can't help themselves some people can't help themselves,0.109240495
but I just go see it,0.05345317
it was amazing,0.06680872
it was so well done,0.06856015
it wasn't one of these things where you're trying to figure out how to save the rest of the world,0.08701026
but you're left in a situation we're like hey okay humanity might end up being okay,0.29523474
but it really is just focusing on this family their struggles and how they're gonna make it out in the end,0.07342461
so honestly fantastic job like literally the second I finished watching the movie I like tweeted said amazing job two drunkards in ski cuz I honestly think that he needs he needs an award for this,0.40336677
he needs an award for this,0.073681206
if this is not nominated for an Oscar next year,0.05483845
I'm gonna be super pissed off,0.49476552
you guys are gonna see a video about me,0.11126881
yelling have a ye quiet place was not nominated and I'm talking Best Picture I'm not talking like cinematography,0.14873491
I'm not talking aside stuff,0.1730862
I'm talking best picture because this is the best movie I've seen in years I think honestly because oh my god go see this movie it was fantastic,0.10915
don't judge me for the emotional reaction that's gonna do it for today's video,0.09086496
so thank you all,0.051315196
so much for watching have a fantastic day and we'll catch,0.07175356
you all later,0.08572434
