I'm gonna be completely honest I do not know how the YouTube algorithm is gonna,0.15116984
deal with this video because the title of this movie is black clansmen spelt like,0.11489838
this in which case these letters in sequence are part of the title in respect,0.06864694
to the filmmaker respect to Spike Lee that's how he wants the title to be,0.08382972
I will have the title like that in this video so the YouTube algorithm might,0.14882958
bury the video my dia monetize it I don't know we'll see what happens black,0.5918117
clansmen so black clansmen is the insane true story taking place in 1979 a black,0.3801104
cop officer ron Stallworth played by john david washington yes that is Denzel Washington son,0.14805679
and he's great in the movie sometimes when we talk to you like that is,0.07360115
Denzel he essentially answers an ad in the paper for the Ku Klux Klan so,0.16256498
he infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan which when I heard the promise I was like,0.2681712
is it a comedy like Clayton Bigsby from Chappelle's Show it is not a comedy,0.11378668
it is a very heavy drama it does have comedy in it and I appreciated,0.13473052
that but unless the Klan went completely blind in the 70s he couldn't show up,0.11135464
to meet them so he talks to them on the phone and Adam drivers character,0.072788544
he goes and meets that so both of them essentially play the same person for,0.0801086
the most part I've really enjoyed this movie like I said it's heavy I mean,0.13238397
the content is very heavy it's mostly heavy because you know for a fact this,0.17368884
movie is a message to today to modern-day to us because those who don't learn,0.11710038
from history are doomed to repeat it and the hate circle it's still there you,0.10362774
look online on social media on Twitter whatever you just feel like we're going in,0.089086376
a circle as we circle the drain down the toilet bowl and while I have,0.16573554
made videos in the past talking about how I don't feel every movie needs a,0.10047946
political or social message in it sometimes a movie needs to be an escape it,0.073096335
escapism is real black clansmen is not one of those movies you go to to,0.36114556
escape I mean when I saw the trailer I was like that movie's going to,0.06413709
have a message is gonna be very relevant to today if you don't think that,0.07134754
going into this movie you're fooling yourself in fact it should be one of the,0.32835913
reasons you go to this movie so if you don't like that or don't want,0.14973965
that you have been warned what the movie does very well is it does show,0.17591743
sides I mean it's not like a wolf done the Klan they're just doing their,0.28960088
thing hate but you know perspective it's not like that they do show them all,0.2627198
meeting and they do come across you just like oh hi Chuck you have some,0.19132131
burgers because you can't really pick out a bigot you can't go to the mall,0.29920897
and just be like that's a racist that's not a racist doesn't work like that,0.37280983
but also the Black Panthers are a part of this movie and when Ron Stallworth,0.1719851
is talking from someone from the Black Panthers that is a very fascinating conversation because,0.36753622
conversation is well you're the enemy and he's like I'm a cop and I'm trying,0.41517088
to do good I'm trying to help you so I really liked the movie Illustrated,0.08467081
sometimes people who are fighting for the same thing just see each other as the,0.076216996
enemy the movie does have a couple of Donald Trump references and oh some people,0.31089434
just say they knock a lot date back when they hear that but I felt,0.10308949
like it was within character David Duke in this movie played by Topher Grace I,0.07572001
thought I did a great job too maybe dude being the former leader of the,0.059174225
Ku Klux Klan but David Duke in real life has said he likes like he's,0.40312716
advocated for Trump so when David Duke in this movie makes a reference about one,0.19204582
day someone will be in office that makes America great again I don't think David,0.14062472
Duke said the words make America great again in 1979 obviously David Duke likes Trump,0.24095705
so we must have something in his mind at some time that Trump would then,0.11823638
later say that would click with him so it's just showing that connection so it's,0.0695713
within character not like the purge marketing department trying to play up to make America,0.09666419
great again thing where I'm like that's a mag a hat and the Trump administration,0.14916179
is not going to make the purge happen you're just over reaching purge movies I,0.20008126
do feel things got really real in the end credits but I also feel like,0.0560965
he really stuck that landing with the end credits or it was right before the,0.10388451
end credit it shows real footage of recent times and your force it just gives,0.104365565
you pause you have to think about it just like Spike Lee was like no,0.21334259
we're gonna have this conversation because we've been having the conversation for a little over,0.05727455
two hours now here's the cherry on top you have to ask after that nlgger,0.30904445
in Charlottesville Virginia like why couldn't the president just get up there and be like,0.109736785
all black people out there know this we are not going back in time please,0.794439
do not be afraid of that we are moving forward we are a progressive nation,0.12027756
when I said I wanted to make America great again what I meant was take,0.12583593
it back to the booming economy I did not mean I was gonna isolate you,0.09307595
please know that we will make America better than before with everybody as equals including,0.10300194
you nlgger the Ku Klux Klan like why couldn't you just say that I don't,0.5559623
get too political I'm here but but why message aside as a movie narrative Lee,0.10313566
speaking I thought the movie was actually it was very engaging it's not the most,0.07556111
exciting thing ever but when Adam driver is there amidst this Ku Klux Klan rally,0.22817144
you're just like don't get caught at all I did appreciate the humor when it,0.1841996
was in everything like I said this movie is not a comedy it is a,0.09535891
drama the movie is so applicable the modern day sometimes it just feels heavy and,0.09690635
with that heaviness you need something you need to laugh sometimes the movie gives you,0.21963702
a few chuckles now and then I appreciated that because life has chuckles no matter,0.11524208
what like there's nothing on earth no form of entertainment no medium has so perfectly,0.14733158
blended all genres as well as life itself has so when a drama has comedy,0.22879593
it's just life I do feel like the movie has some pacing issues sometimes I,0.08607338
mean the movies 2 hours 20 minutes near the end the last third of the,0.070391715
movie I was like this is dragging on you could pick it up whereas I,0.0879576
feel like that should have been sped up there are some times with the girlfriend,0.14549619
who is a part of the Black Panthers she's great when she's on screen but,0.31089434
I forget about her when she's not and then the movie goes back to her,0.24253558
after a long oh yeah that's right she's a part of it I felt like,0.1613938
that was a little uneven and there were some stylistic choices when the intense thing,0.053210314
is happening when it is going down it's it's 70s music which it takes place,0.07430932
in the 70s should make sense but when watching it it just doesn't I just,0.044164825
imagined more intense music playing and I would have been on the edge of my,0.07890314
seat it's not the only questionable stylistic choice in this movie this Black Panther leader,0.41398615
is talking he's giving a speech you're like it was a very engaging speech but,0.18753229
it cuts to the audience listening to it but it's not the audience really it's,0.06271557
certain heads in the audience that are like fading in and out there's a strange,0.12866858
cult guys in the end I really enjoyed black Klansmen it's an insane tale that's,0.42778605
a true story everyone did a great job in an atom drivers fantastic John David,0.07027105
Washington want to see more of him the movies not perfect but it sticks the,0.14514932
landing of its message it was engaging it was thrilling at times and I personally,0.10211787
thought it was a great time no alcohol required there was actually a really great,0.070812814
philosophical moment that lends itself to a debate and here he's talking about this movie,0.10545839
Birth of a Nation I've never seen it but apparently it really empowered the Ku,0.11053475
Klux Klan so this movie changed the world in which case you could argue art,0.2738469
changes reality but the phrase has always been art imitates reality so if reality is,0.07116397
changed by art but then art imitates reality it is very circular it's like the,0.08437778
source of the reflection becoming the reflection it just goes back and forth that is,0.03618902
another conversation for the people to have at their whim all right so black Klansmen,0.5154597
have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below,0.08795561
let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you,0.12440908
