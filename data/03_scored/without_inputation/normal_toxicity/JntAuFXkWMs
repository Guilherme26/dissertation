so for the positives of the godfather,0.15500207
there are a bunch most first and foremost you got the story which is just so enthralling and investing you really feel like you're a part of the corleone family and you really just want to know what happens next if you it's three hours in length,0.1551239
but it feels like two hours because you're always on the edge of your seat,0.16754627
you always want to know what's going to happen,0.07936842
next to these characters because they write the script so well that you're invested into their life and you feel like they're a part of your family and you just you care for them so deeply that you're like you don't want them to die,0.37381503
you want them to keep going,0.09386045
you want to know what happens next and that i think is just perfect writing,0.07348188
the script is absolutely phenomenal,0.048202943
it was co-written by the director francis ford coppola and i think it's just absolutely amazing adding on to that the characters are so amazing some of the greatest in cinematic history the two that stand out obviously are vito corleone and michael corleone which are both absolutely phenomenal characters i personally like michael a little bit better which is why i'm excited to see the godfather part two because that's gonna be all,0.06272048
michael since he owns the family business now,0.02949595
but i just find michael to be so much more of a badass kind of mafia boss which he kind of gives off that vibe,0.518349
when he's running the business near the like the second half of the film and it's just he i like him so much better he resembles a mobster a little more than i think vito did but having said this marlon brando does give a phenomenal performance as vito as does al pacino,0.1839153
as michael,0.071181916
so the performances are amazing,0.053478308
the characters are just great,0.035523184
and yeah those are my positives,0.08240124
now for the negatives of the film i really don't have any the only one is really with being widely considered as the greatest film ever made you would expect the cinematography and visuals to be like out of this world just blow your mind but it's really not having said that though it's not a problem,0.1976797
per se because they do their job,0.089680694
the cinematography is good enough,0.059078056
it does its job it makes you feel what you need to feel but it's just it didn't try anything special in my opinion,0.08903071
and for that reason i do give it a con because that is something about a film that i really do personally enjoy,0.13503522
but it doesn't bring the film that down that much with all,0.052728467
this being said i'm going to have to give the godfather from 1972 a 99,0.09280981
it is not quite a 100 film for me but it is 99 which is absolutely phenomenal makes,0.07877099
its way into my top 10 favorite films of all time,0.10660363
it was just so great,0.057514157
i cannot wait to watch part two and yeah that's gonna do it,0.12152799
