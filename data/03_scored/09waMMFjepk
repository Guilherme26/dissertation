debut 8th grade oh now 8th grade is a film that's kind of hard to,0.12756611
summarize because it's really about the network of things that go on in the film,0.09448762
essentially though the movie follows Kayla day in her final week up eighth grade she,0.1371861

you just kind of roll your eyes and go okay well not another melodramatic coming-of-age,0.60503596
film but this movie is anything but that it is a really impressive directorial debut,0.084133916
from Bo Burnham it's kind of a set of wandering episodes or experiences across Kayla's,0.08332931
final week of middle school and as you watch these episodes unfold it really develops,0.089026466
her into a complex individual you really empathize and feel for her fears and her,0.10106012
concerns and the things that she is going through she's incredibly easy to empathize with,0.1224884
the situations that Burnham has written into the film into the screenplay are really incredible,0.038742587

internet and online communication is becoming and has become a really important and meaningful part,0.057008192
of communication to a lot of people growing up right now and how the Internet,0.090855435
is an important part of the maturation experience and how that impacts the relationships that,0.052674428

their hands but outside of that the situations that Burnham has brought into this film,0.080360755
are really really poignant the relationship between Kayla and her father the relay ship between,0.0906358

these wonderful glimpses at the difficulty of relationships and the fears that come out of,0.09413441
relationships that work or don't work when you're in middle school going into high school,0.1543462
and the acting is brilliant LLC Fischer who plays Kayla is phenomenal and Burnham has,0.07403693
done a great job choosing a young actress who is not recognizable who can jump,0.18127644
into this role as this eighth grader who is is feeling insecure and unsure of,0.26627198
herself and looking for ways to grow into this world Josh Hamilton as the father,0.13338186

too cold and I can heat them up in the microwave from there okay okay,0.19953436
and the directing is really solid it's not spectacular in terms of catching your attention,0.09004043
but does exactly what it needs to and Burnham has worked with his camera and,0.06575634
his scimitars to do a really great job of capturing with such simple photography such,0.07287117
