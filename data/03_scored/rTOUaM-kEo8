one chick from the office who played Phyllis Lewis Black & Mindy Kaling and it's,0.010724661
about a young girl named Riley who's about 12 years old and lives in Minnesota,0.13378869
and she said incredible life friends family plays hockey everything's great until her whole life,0.12227187
is upturned by her moving to San Francisco and the movie instead of just being,0.05806396
you know drama about a normal girl as it is Pixar we've got to do,0.23749672
something interesting we've got to do something personified and so this movie is not about,0.07616496
Riley so much as it is about Riley's emotions Riley's brain the five emotions inside,0.2425625
her head that our joy sadness anger disgust and fear and through this you could,0.46367306
see how these emotions interact and how they influence one another which kind of makes,0.072950326
up how our brain chemistry works and its really really interesting take on how we,0.15067297
are able to make our own decisions and how the memories that we have in,0.03260133
our past affect us and how we forget things and our imagination and just so,0.032903086
many many incredible ideas that really make this film one of the best animated movies,0.06931569
to come out in a long long time now I've been disillusioned with Pixar for,0.11643828
a little bit because in my personal opinion I really haven't loved any of their,0.18629931
movies since 2006 I think cars is an absolute masterpiece in every single movie they,0.12065345
made before that was an absolute masterpiece ratatouille was the first one where was like,0.13107327
yeah it was okay and all the other ones really just weren't that memorable toy,0.24109654
story 3 notwithstanding of course so when people were acting oh my god pit inside,0.12059948
outs coming out in my mind it was like this looks really great I love,0.15800242
the concept and the premise and I was like you know what I feel like,0.041317213
Pixar's back and my opinion this is their comeback for me I like they've had,0.096877456
a dry spell for a while and I'm just as excited for the next movie,0.080143586
the good dinosaur but to focus in on inside out this movie is incredible it,0.15168561
is so well done I think it's probably at least in their top three of,0.06640067
greatest films that they've made first off the animation itself was just beautiful I love,0.17794459
how the emotions in the film look like they're made out of like this sort,0.08183938
of fuzzy sparkly kind of like imaginative you know brain matter or whatever the first,0.5555846
emotion that dough that is in somebody's head is a shot that Riley as a,0.2967793
child her mind is joy and when joy shows up she only has one button,0.21280985
the press and that's just flat because there's nothing else on this like this is,0.09613619
tiny little control panel and that's it didn't like little parts of her mind will,0.31089434
start appearing and it's like the brain is starting to develop itself core memories the,0.24019863
things that really make you a person the train of thought which a meat which,0.18999429
made me chuckle immediately as soon as they said there was a train of thought,0.12740675
I took a second and I got it the tracks disappear and literally that they,0.12134498
is described by another character as oh it just kind of goes all over the,0.041476913
place um besides the animation itself all the voice acting is great Amy Poehler just,0.11351087
completely its best role ever I've seen her and she's so good as joy and,0.07796729
her relationship with sadness was really interesting Mindy Kaling is really really entertaining is discussed,0.1285741
liked her much more than I thought I would and of course Lewis Black is,0.109865084
just completely perfect casting as anger who i'm sure all the kids loved when he,0.2538553
his head catches on fire my favorite character in the film was actually fear i,0.12714344
thought he was really really well done and kind of an underused player in all,0.05768545
of this bill hader plays him expertly part of joy and sadness adventure takes them,0.13443272
to dream productions which is at night when Riley goes to sleep there's this movie,0.056497738
studio that puts on these shows and they are watched by only one thing which,0.066838704
is fear ever anger disgust everything else is asleep except fear he stays awake okay,0.16802973
and he's just sitting there watching these things that basically it's just it's just hidden,0.10105678
reacting whether he gets afraid or not and it's just like him gone oh yeah,0.15336332
this is boring oh she's a bad actress blah blah and it was app that,0.4797371
was my favorite scene in the movie by far it was not just because it,0.05716827
was funny it was just so clever and the way they were doing it on,0.114106655
how like everybody was being played by like a thought figment of her imagination and,0.105963625
then they put on a rat reality distortion filter over the lens and it just,0.25226435
looks like they're all people uh and it was it was funny I also like,0.088403784
how they have a little bit they have a little joke about film predictability where,0.15646543
they were fears just going oh yeah her pants are probably going to be down,0.31089434
isn't it Oh yep fan sir down that was it's just the things that these,0.08468108
people must have thought up when they were coming up with this movie they must,0.083095305
have had a ball with it there is a really really powerful subplot or may,0.11251362
perhaps the main plot which is the joys relationship with sadness and how you would,0.11202771
imagine those two don't get along and how joy just really doesn't understand sadness she,0.15681694
doesn't understand her purpose why is she here of course and her mind said this,0.15544608
should just you know not really exist why should a person be sad and sadness,0.20711197
also doesn't really understand who she is or why she exists and that whole relationship,0.10329259
and the the coming to understand each other is a huge core of the film,0.13512807
and that and that of course at a time in a girl's life where she,0.19080128
is moving dealing with all these emotions joy and sadness are struggling with each other,0.048097566
that's exactly what would happen it's the exact point in time where an adventure such,0.08072047
of this would occur in her head we're both joy and sadness kind of become,0.31089434
lost to you know anger and fear and disgust and it totally makes sense during,0.24176314
a fight between these two characters they accidentally become lost somewhere in the confines of,0.11178347
Riley's brain and they must work their way through it try and find their way,0.48988882
back to the control center where they can try and make Riley happy again some,0.057542764
kids would see it as just a interesting fantasy adventure about these personified emotions but,0.1759582
it's actually a really really deep story and a really really interesting take on you,0.09940204
know the way a person reacts to change and the way kids sometimes have to,0.07456981
act a certain way in front of their parents versus the way they would act,0.096059985
in front of other people what would cause certain things to happen such as why,0.085743174
do you start crying in the middle of happy memory sometimes because it's nostalgic and,0.13238333
sad because you just don't have the thing more and they explore all these different,0.10571419
aspects of it and that was really interesting to be honest a lot of the,0.038119953
emotions were totally different than I thought they were going to be a particularly fear,0.11928313
instead of you know just being afraid of everything he's trying to keep Riley safe,0.10072671
no matter what he's trying to help her he's not actually a very unhappy person,0.27355275
her constantly afraid as I thought he would be he just has a tendency to,0.24023698
become afraid most of maybe he's just being cautious he's just trying to be you,0.14220974
know helpful and I really really like that I thought that was really interesting similarly,0.0725099
anger isn't just this villain one of the best things about this movie is that,0.15529802
they don't go that route and they don't take emotions like anger or sadness or,0.1090393
fear and they make them villains there is no villain in this movie and that,0.108599745
is one of the best things about it it's that the the real enemy is,0.11135892
just life and the problems we encounter like there's no enemy to fight there's no,0.073620856
bad guy to defeat there's just a situation that you need to overcome which is,0.16132428
that's the way life is there's no enemy there's no no one you can point,0.09498872
the finger at except this is just the things we're going through and I think,0.12432908
that that's one of the most powerful things about it and I love that and,0.050082117
of course where the story goes ends up being really interesting of joy coming to,0.050242193
terms with sadnesses existence and satisfying a purpose and it was really really really beautiful,0.14176303
and really really interesting and it just all came up and wrapped together in this,0.07407605
little bow and when I won't finish the movie I'm like that was perfect All,0.164507
Things Considered I would give inside out a nine out of ten thanks for watching,0.17992894
