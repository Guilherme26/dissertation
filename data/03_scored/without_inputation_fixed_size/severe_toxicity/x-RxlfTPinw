admit that my knowledge of the subject was very minimal and basic. Iím sure quite,0.02862019

"of information. The Irishman is an ambitious and huge film, tackling a complex and layered,",0.06821392
decade-long story. One of the most interesting aspects for me was not only just how,0.017587455
"well the different time periods were used, but how they were integrated with one another.",0.008131205
We follow Frankís story through three distinct time periods: as an old man in the,0.042806562
"late 90s or early 2000s, recounting the story, as a middle-aged man in the mid-70s,",0.0144497845
and as a young man just getting his start with the Bufalino crime family in,0.075056665

"minutes of the film and the story is told in a semi-nonlinear way, frequently cutting",0.021672348

"context to most of the transitions and, remarkably, it never gets confusing. The temporal context",0.011413886
"certainly helps with that, but the distinct visuals donít hurt either. The story spans nearly",0.037888195
"fifty years of Frankís life, so both deaging effects and old-age makeup are used quite",0.066654064
"effectively to show the passage of time. Speaking of time, I should probably mention the",0.019312942
aspect of this film thatís garnered the most attention in the months prior to its,0.021900507
release: its length. The Irishman is three and a half hours long. Iíd be lying,0.06042462
"if I said I didnít start to feel that length a bit, but it was",0.040418554
"never really to the detriment of the film. Keep in mind, gangster movies arenít my",0.1835867
"thing, so the fact that I only felt the length a bit is pretty amazing",0.039867118
and a testament to how engaging a movie it really is. There were a few,0.025789835
"dialogue-heavy scenes that got a little slow for me, but that was more a pacing",0.050249968

"expect from a gangster movie like this, but I was struck by the degree of",0.17059433
"humor present throughout. Itís certainly not a comedy, but it does have some entertaining moments",0.05523685
thanks to the editing style as well as Frankís narration. The Irishman was never gonna,0.04676374
"be a film for me, but I have no doubt that itís gonna go down",0.05525215
"as one of the greats of the genre. Alright, letís talk about the pros and",0.061409753
cons. Pro number one is the utilization of the time periods. A story as involved,0.019839767
as this one requires a lot of information. So much backstory and build-up is necessary,0.036936317
"for us to understand not only the events, but also the characters and their motivations.",0.009430309
"The multi-decade approach was the best way to tackle that, but it was also a",0.021666361
risky move. Nonlinear stories can be tough to get right and the need to age,0.01830652

"off, not only from a technical standpoint, but also from a storytelling one, maintaining the",0.019818481
audienceís interest and understanding from one time period transition to the next. The second pro,0.015875937
has gotta be the performances. Iím sure this comes as no surprise given the stacked,0.074343584

"based on a true story. Robert De Niro is the clear standout for me, but",0.017701868
"the whole cast really did an excellent job. On the con side, the only substantive",0.062485356
issue I had was the pacing. Iím sure many people will point to the filmís,0.053160146

con thatíll disappear for Netflix viewers who have the option to pause and take short,0.083082765
breaks if necessary. Iím gonna give The Irishman 3.5 out of 5 paws. Itís a,0.057905566
very well-made and surprisingly interesting film that many will surely love. Gangster movies just arenít,0.070128314
