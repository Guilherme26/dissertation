hey guys,0.05914233
this is my review for Dunkirk,0.07502053
okay full disclosure before the screening I ate a quinoa salad with a side of french fries,0.07502044
because you need balance in life and I had half a glass of roses my mood was rested and happy and my expectation for this film was very high,0.10743323
I didn't know much about the historical context of Dunkirk before I saw the movie so I did a little bit of research and that proved to be pretty helpful because the movie doesn't give much context about what part of World War 2 this is happening in from the first frame though it is relentlessly suspenseful the fighting scenes are intense,0.07186635
but they're not gory or gratuitous writer director Christopher Nolan really did an astonishing job of making it feel both real and epic newcomer Finn Whitehead and Oscar winner mark Ryland gave the standout performances but I have to admit Harry Styles he wasn't bad,0.11625319
in fact he was pretty good okay one small complaint I couldn't always understand the dialogue because the accents are really thick and they're competing with the score and gunfire and aircraft etc,0.09079482
but that is truly my only complaint,0.08104973
I think that Dunkirk is an amazing cinematic experience and it is worth seeing in 70 millimeter film there are 125 theaters across the country showing it that way,0.05778256
and if there's one near you it is worth speaking out,0.099359475
I hope you liked it,0.0835536
