meltdown but i just didn't know if my brain cells could handle that so i,0.10596309

some film advice some things that you guys can can watch and too many people,0.0174032
are just popping on netflix and watching the first thing that gets recommended like i,0.051412042

my best of 2019 video i was on the intercut podcast talking about my favorite,0.046661302
movies of 2019 but i figured that this was actually a good opportunity to talk,0.018895207
about some of those movies because at this point a lot of them are now,0.02832352
available either on streaming services or through rental or even purchasing if you're feeling extra,0.024838623
into it also before we get into this like specific 2019 list i do have,0.044228725
an overall social isolation list on my letter box that i'll have linked down below,0.05331181
so let's start with my absolute favorite of 2019 portrait of lady on fire the,0.20032671
latest from french directoris celine siama this is an incredibly beautiful movie about a woman,0.13722207
who is hired to paint the portrait of another woman who is being unwillingly given,0.0319215
away in marriage it's a beautiful drama romance but it's also just a tragic look,0.05720646
at freedom and a lack thereof this movie essentially has three endings and each one,0.053729545
stabs me in the heart a little bit more until i'm left a crying wreck,0.51125544
in the bell lightbox theater room and the number 28 will never be the same,0.014817631
this is now freshly available on hulu and will be available for rent in april,0.023645284
with the criterion collection has opened pre-orders for it and currently have a 30 off,0.03105676
sale going i believe until april 30th this one might come as a shock considering,0.06578932
how much i do end up making fun of some of the teen related netflix,0.053755485
movies but i really think that this particular movie is very pertinent to our way,0.02923083
of living right now so we are starting off with one of the finest selections,0.028360104
in the teen death romance category it is the movies that make romantic stories out,0.070465565
of teenagers dying potentially started with a walk to remember but has been popularized by,0.048656188
such novels by john green that went on to become things like the fault is,0.02832618
in our stars and most of them are a little bit weird but i'm recommending,0.17070808
five feet apart because even in the movie they're supposed to be six feet apart,0.06429466
which is exactly the life we're living right now if you ain't six feet apart,0.09320154
from the people around you you ain't here to party because you shouldn't be anywhere,0.0934603
to party so it's basically just a story of teenagers that have cystic fibrosis which,0.18606317
is a very serious lung condition uh they can't share their germs so that's why,0.019134672
they have to stay six feet apart and i just think that maybe we can,0.038669787
all learn a little something and honestly in terms of this style of movie i,0.046693232
didn't hate it i actually had a really good time watching it uh before the,0.03760549
year really progressed itself it was like shockingly high on my 2019 list another one,0.05280228
that i thought was shockingly fun was fighting with my family starring florence pugh who,0.08069809
just went on to tear up 2019 and stole all of our hearts with such,0.07392452
heartwarming roles like danny and midsummer i'm not a fan of wrestling so i don't,0.023769673
really know the intricacies of the situation in this movie and the family being portrayed,0.043671302
and i've heard some people complain about it but overall i enjoyed this way more,0.041466217
than i thought i would i remember they announced this as like the secret movie,0.018839996
at last year's sundance and everyone kind of laughed but i had a really good,0.026048591
time watching it 100 would recommend apparently it's available on hulu and you can rent,0.02363597
it touching on some horror related flicks we're going to start with the nightingale which,0.20638919
i do actually have an entire video about my experience last year's sundance it was,0.027239935
kind of a very wild movie experience all things considered and that's actually my third,0.053428214
most viewed video of all time which is kind of crazy it's a very brutal,0.16378617
watch and has a couple of very very rough scenes and i do think there's,0.031685356
some people that aren't going to be able to handle it so depending if you've,0.029144356
kind of experienced different traumas in your life it might be something you want to,0.052712478
look into a little bit more before you watch it but the movie is incredibly,0.1056764
well made it can run a little long i feel like they could have shaved,0.057860333
off some of the time on it but it's definitely worth the watch and if,0.02216924
you want a little bit more spoiler-free information feel free to check my video which,0.12373414
i'll have linked up below this is available on hulu and of course you can,0.053444844
rent it and of course we would not be talking about 2019 horror unless i,0.049977243
took a second and talked about midsomar and if you've seen hereditary you might as,0.030996893
well just continue with arya's mission of putting grief to film and lingering on really,0.030459424
uncomfortable imagery this is probably not the movie to watch with a significant other if,0.029375175
you don't feel like your relationship's going really well or maybe it's like a really,0.04042055
good opportunity to like kick your life in the pants and get yourself in order,0.8486256
i don't know i can't judge you you know swedish summer festival disturbing rituals fantastic,0.08470449
acting stunning visuals beautiful cinematography no one is doing what arya's doing in film right,0.08435393
now and that's probably a good thing because i don't think i can handle any,0.042452686
more than one movie like this a year this should be available streaming on amazon,0.026594708
prime in the usn canada and it's also available through rental first foreign film up,0.017719828
on the dock we're gonna be talking about takashi mike's first love which i've mentioned,0.018985007
a few times before this is one of my favorites coming out of tiff i,0.094027035
absolutely loved it it's a fun over-the-top violent movie about the yakuza feuding with the,0.09157916
chinese gang over stolen drugs and this girl who gets caught up in the middle,0.38540536
and this guy who chooses to help her because he feels like he has nothing,0.101273544
left to lose don't let the title fool you this movie is badass now do,0.23688865
you want a movie with an academy award-winning actress threatening a disney star with a,0.1778016
shard of glass and that disney star then goes on to bite the ear off,0.15663145
a zombie child and the whole thing is happening at a petting zoo in new,0.22441252
zealand of course you do little monsters was one of my absolute favorite movies from,0.23338431
last year and hearing the director talk about his inspiration for making it made me,0.026085177
love it even more academy award winning actress lupe sandiango is trying to keep her,0.08726278
kindergarten class safe from a contained zombie outbreak while simultaneously trying to convince them that,0.07710077
nothing is going on and then the whole thing is just a game we got,0.020730449
blood we got comedy we got taylor swift on the ukulele it's just good fun,0.15518601
and this one is available streaming on hulu and you can also rent it now,0.034177136
the lighthouse is a movie that actually gets better every single time i watch it,0.035939205
another incredibly stylistic horror director david eggers who also did the witch or the vivic,0.29283738
brought us the height of cabin fever and the downside to social isolations and just,0.037792407
being trapped inside this lighthouse while the world outside you falls apart is it a,0.046569508
good idea to watch this movie right now is a little bit too real i,0.12934163
don't know it could actually just give you the perspective that things could always be,0.01948323
significantly worse i did a light review on this video while also talking about parasite,0.22555153
and zombieland 2 and i do actually want to make an entire video talking about,0.14197946
all the different research and the inspiration that went into the script behind this and,0.012217428
all the different work that he does as a director when he makes these stories,0.019075472
we'll probably still do that it'll really leave you wondering about these old sailor tales,0.074716754
how much is true how much is just bad luck and it's also significantly more,0.031354096
hilarious at times than it has any business being and plunges right through your gullet,0.058158338
bursting ye all right have it your way i like your cooking defoe was 100,0.34007725
snubbed by the academy i would definitely recommend the watch now we're going to steer,0.06366805
into some of the more quirky stuff or just the stuff that doesn't necessarily fit,0.020979892
a certain genre and we're going to start off with that with the art of,0.028301569
self defense i don't know what i was expecting going into this movie but it,0.04917902
was absolutely wild it starts jesse eisenberg playing a pretty meek guy who ends up,0.11098057
getting jumped at the start and then goes on to take karate lessons to learn,0.07531143
how to defend himself everything that falls out after this is completely wild but i,0.037620127
do need to do my civic duty and let you know that something happens to,0.01886727
a dog in this movie but there is vengeance i think it's worth a watch,0.09013105
overall if you're in for something a little bit different i believe this is available,0.037976
to rent all over and it seems to be available on crave for streaming in,0.06626027
canada so maybe hulu in the us next up was one of the most talked,0.050269924
of the town last year that some people might not have had a chance to,0.022104718
watch yet and it is uncut gems unfortunately i do think this was recently removed,0.06489066
from streaming on netflix in the us but it is still available in canada and,0.03709064
i think the rest of the world on netflix so you can still watch it,0.03763343
there i'm still planning to do a full video on this movie but my best,0.046183035
description of describing how it feels to watch this is that you think you're starting,0.025141947
a movie with a guy who's just digging a hole and his life's just getting,0.2808912
worse as he digs this hole but then you quickly realize that he was already,0.17946522
five feet in the hole before the movie even started and we're just watching that,0.101218335
last foot go down this is an incredibly stressful movie to watch it's like two,0.07150192
hours of scott's tots there were two older couples in front of me at tiff,0.029226175
that had to leave halfway through because it was stressing them out too much and,0.061776936
one of my friends apple watches was alerting him to a heightened heart rate it's,0.039766673
easily one of the best performances adam sandler has ever given in his life and,0.04906062
it's a damn shame that he got no love from the academy for it it's,0.45684505
a wild ride next up is something that needs no introduction we're talking parasite no,0.13295491
surprises here won the academy award for best picture and it's well deserved this is,0.022996064
an incredibly well made movie by south korean director bong joon ho and it excels,0.17519142
everywhere the story is tight it juggles serious social commentary while standing on its own,0.037460484
as a great film something some other films have struggled with or downright failed at,0.029524175
in recent memory it goes through a multitude of themes from comedy to drama to,0.01904687
thriller with a sprinkle of horror the acting's incredible the shots are incredible the house,0.12372083
is incredible well worth getting over the one inch tall barrier of subtitles and giving,0.068185315
this a watch you should be able to rent this pretty much everywhere as right,0.039114796
now and for my last quirky recommend is under the silver lake which i actually,0.056969654
watched back in 2018 and then it didn't get any kind of push until 2019,0.022217134
and even then they still didn't push it this is an a24 movie the champion,0.028840367
of the independent film that does such a good job marketing its stuff and making,0.01202785
people fall in love with these off the beat films that usually wouldn't have gotten,0.089408666
any recognition otherwise so i have no idea why they failed so much with the,0.024638401
promotion and distribution of this movie because it does have a super dedicated fan base,0.02368586
this movie is basically a wild conspiracy driven film in which the main character sam,0.0796757
played by andrew garfield tries to figure out what happened to a girl that he,0.028009553
met at his apartment complex after she abruptly vanishes overnight it's wild it's got a,0.047118947
bunch of secret codes there's an entire subreddit dedicated to decoding all the different things,0.048332907
in the movie and trying to find secret meaning on things in album covers and,0.026346594
pizza boxes and symbols on walls absolutely love it i believe this is available on,0.035494864
amazon prime for streaming and if you have to rent it i personally think it's,0.06251063
definitely worth it especially if you're looking for something that's just a little bit less,0.12020201
conventional so now we're going to kind of get into the comedy drama related stuff,0.04384026
and we'll start off with one that i know is just added to hulu in,0.04280856
the united states big time adolescent starring griffin gluck and pete davidson again this was,0.1386522
one of my favorites from last year's sundance this is a coming-of-age story where a,0.022159263
teenager is looking up to an older guy as a personal hero and that older,0.040263567
guy loves having the teenager around because it makes him feel cool pete's character obviously,0.04491453
isn't the best role model and ultimately starts to corrupt griffin's character so really i,0.044889253
think this is a really solid hilarious yet at times very depressing coming of age,0.14735214
story y'all know i love my coming-of-age stories but if you have hulu no reason,0.051777896
not to pop this on but i would recommend the rent if it's available for,0.025269661
rent onto another coming of age no surprise we got book smart on the list,0.09316429
if you haven't managed to catch book smart yet i highly recommend it i love,0.09216385
the fact that this movie has nothing to do with friendships being ruined because a,0.048993435
guy gets in the way it has nothing to do with petty jealousy or competition,0.05744925
which is so refreshing obviously there's conflict but it's more to do with differences in,0.023466349
personal growth and becoming their own people it also does a really great job showing,0.04191056
that just because you think you're better than other people doesn't mean they're not going,0.039516564
to be successful the nerdy kids can be jerks too and the people that were,0.45746592
mean to you aren't all destined for failure the person who bullied me the most,0.14849693
is the heiress to an entire shipping corporation her life's gonna be fine this is,0.032974485
available on amazon prime another one that i have a full video for knives out,0.12835318
i love this movie we got good ol whodunit wrapped in a thriller it's such,0.22587204
a fun watch incredible performances from everyone involved i think it looks beautiful as a,0.037830323
movie and there are so many little easter eggs throughout the house and throughout the,0.049914714
film in general that you'll catch on repeat viewings very very fun watch next up,0.041317884
is jojo rabbit which is another academy award nominee and screenplay winner again get a,0.005473131
full video about this on my channel but it's essentially a satire taking a look,0.105794795
at how easy it is to indoctrinate people in hateful ideologies and how pertinent that,0.07404891
still is today and how easy it can be to change those views when people,0.03160354
are given the chance to confront the things they think they hate not many people,0.06116829
seem to dislike this movie so it's definitely a recommend for me another big nominee,0.08942662
at the academy awards we got once upon a time in hollywood tarantino's love letter,0.021063706
to hollywood as well as what might have been a meta look at his own,0.033611063
career and legacy movie follows washed up actor rick dalton as he stares down the,0.05672021
barrel of his own obsolescence at the turn of the decade this is another one,0.047745552
of tarantino's flipped history movies changing the events from the manson murders but unlike the,0.03827467
hunting of sharon tate this doesn't just turn into a weird exploitation horror on a,0.07142676
real tragedy and ultimately lends to a greater commentary on tarantino's own critics who constantly,0.045171957
come at him for the violence in his films the slower burn for most of,0.27240965
the movie but my god does he make up for that in his final act,0.069608144
now my favorite video on my channel remains to this day to be my shia,0.07804533
labeouf video and in that video i talk about peanut butter falcon so if you,0.12692435
haven't seen that video you should go watch it because i love it and it's,0.059470743
my it's my baby i love that video so much but peanut butter falcon specifically,0.0993199
is this amazing journey of a movie it's so heartwarming i went out of my,0.06754474
way to watch it in la and i'm from canada dakota johnson stands i know,0.10104472
you're out there watch this movie it's it's just great it's just so nice keeping,0.03877156
on that train we're gonna go into honeyboy which you guys should also know was,0.03333501
basically my movie of 2019. i've got i just got my alma jorel shirt she,0.07181123
directed it i've got like two different honeyboy shirts i fell in love with that,0.055610683
movie at last year's sundance made sure to prioritize it at tiff last year to,0.013257775
watch it a second time and i'm patiently waiting for the day that i can,0.033783346
buy a physical copy of this movie this is largely an autobiography on shai's life,0.043723185
as a child star while dealing with the abuse from his attic alcoholic father and,0.14887609
learning to let go of years of the pent-up pain that led to his own,0.13177022
breakdowns in life this is a beautiful movie i love it if you were in,0.23845959
the u.s this is available on amazon prime and i urge you to watch it,0.033557184
also watch my shia video i worked really hard on it another of my tops,0.16874844
from last year's sundance the farewell this is an excellent film by director lulu wong,0.012682391
starring aquafina whose family moved from china to america when she was about six years,0.03824141
old it's revealed that her grandmother is dying of cancer and rather than telling her,0.15692148
the family is staging a fake wedding in china to get everyone together one last,0.10049794
time in china this is seen as an act of kindness so the person doesn't,0.0212606
spend their last days worrying this is obviously difficult for billy who feels the pull,0.020875458
from each culture it's a beautiful movie and for something with such seemingly depressing subject,0.09213791
matter it's actually very funny i know this is available on prime in canada so,0.04494114
it's probably available on amazon prime in the us definitely worth your time now i,0.01624711
mentioned this in my oscar discussion video but i relate to nothing in marriage story,0.045255106
but my god what an excellent film that made me feel so much for an,0.032139014
area of the world that i just have nothing in common with it's such a,0.0796318
well-made well-scripted well-directed and well-acted movie about a family struggle during divorce adam driver and,0.013188596
scarlett both did such an amazing job here i've said it before but i wish,0.045844458
this movie had come out in 2020 because with the steep 2019 competition it just,0.024384301
struggled to pick up awards that it could have easily won any other year obviously,0.011771755
this was funded by netflix so it is available on netflix and should be available,0.019402742
on netflix worldwide then some newer ones that should be rolling out into rental little,0.06700528
women in which greta gerwig actually managed to make amy likeable character and allowed each,0.094414175
of the sisters motivations to shine as valuable which is kind of amazing considering how,0.046855535
many times this has been attempted i love the way they implemented a non-linear storytelling,0.07209593
and i really love that it infused some of what louisa may alcott might have,0.05208787
been truly trying to express but wasn't able to because of the time that she,0.04153074
was living in 1917 i know just came out this week and while i realized,0.03060909
it's definitely something better suited to a theater experience i do think it's worth the,0.040250927
watch at home it's a pretty simple story pretty simple script but the enjoyment comes,0.024011133
from the fluidity of the whole movie being designed to feel like one take i,0.03591659
think they do a really good job doing that amazing cinematography as expected the gentleman,0.059446134
i know it's a 2020 movie and i know that people are like it's like,0.05297057
if someone was pretending to be guy richie but it's actually guy ritchie but i,0.16022345
loved this movie i had such a good time watching it and then a few,0.07925064
other ones would be last black man in san francisco happy death day to you,0.6353475
the report loose waves ready or not and the velocipaster there are so many amazing,0.04784533
movies that came out in 2019 these are some of the ones i recommended that,0.03249289
i figured people might not have saw or i just felt like i wanted to,0.045362197
talk about it again so thank you so much for watching have a fantastic day,0.02931797
stay safe out there wash your hands maintain your six feet of space don't go,0.07571187
out if you don't have to have a fantastic day and we'll catch you all,0.090541475
