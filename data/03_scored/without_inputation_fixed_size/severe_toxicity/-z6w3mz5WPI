left this theater I called my grandmother tell her I love her hey everyone is,0.078965284
sure under for paperweights and today i want to be reviewing the farewell which is,0.035593312
directed by lulu lane the film stars aquafina who portrays the character Billie as the,0.0018777323
centers around her family I'm her Chinese family who finds out that her grandmother is,0.061407093
ill does not have that much longer to live and so because due to tradition,0.07682805
they cannot tell her what is wrong with her so as an effort to get,0.04876927
two families together one last time they just basically stage a fake wedding to get,0.05968427
the family to come back into town to see ninety nine and to basically pay,0.037385315
their respects without her knowing they're pairing their respects because she doesn't know that there's,0.052216917
something wrong with her and so one of the interesting facts about this film is,0.045571733
actually based on Lulu Aang's life as this situation happened to her she found out,0.12264789
that her grandmother was actually ill so in the beginning of the films that says,0.124239676
that it is based on an actual lie so for those of you who are,0.09271064
new to my channel I tell you what I liked about the film what I,0.024640398
didn't like about the film is should you pay your wait to see this film,0.028841032
in theaters so I actually had the pleasure of viewing this film earlier in the,0.027811993
year at the Sundance Film Festival when I wanted to see it a second time,0.015855983
mainly because I was dying of a viral infection when I saw this at Sundance,0.05843572
but I would have to say that I really really enjoyed this movie this is,0.029300675
definitely one of my top movies of 2019 and so going into what I liked,0.030372951
about this film I would have to say that aquafina who plays the character Billy,0.053361032
she just such a fantastic job and really one of the first romantic roles that,0.029689142
we've seen her and we know her more as this comedian this rapper that we've,0.03464875
seen in crazy rich Asians we've seen as some of her YouTube channel stuff before,0.2825186
she I'm started doing films and I think that she does such a great job,0.0979596
also more so to the point where I want to see her in more dramatic,0.11547655
roles I think that she really brings you in on this journey she made me,0.04824045
feel like it was my grandma because that's how sad I was watching her but,0.053883202
she finds a great way to balance kind of the drama the sad aspects of,0.057694037
this film because it does deal with grief and it deals with how not only,0.043779727
family does with grief but what happens when you know that you're losing someone close,0.022278996
to you and you know the that time together you know it's very limited and,0.03353257
I thought that she did a very great job of conveying that on the screen,0.06651969
and actually making you feel the same type of emotions that she was feeling but,0.0294836
also to do to the scripts they do a very great job of balancing such,0.022775888
a heavy topic and balancing throwing some comedy in it whereas like we know there's,0.056756794
a sad moment but there's something funny that happens where it's just like okay I,0.03733942
can laugh I can breathe I'm happy again but I would have to say what,0.032665174
are the other standouts of this film and I want to make sure that I,0.056883845
get her name correctly the Xu Xin xao who plays nine night Billy's grandmother she,0.103295706
just such a great job on screen of you really understand why everyone is so,0.026335286
sad not just losing you know a close family member like the potential that you,0.036207277
could lose her but she just has such a great and warm spirit on screen,0.067425676
she's funny she's nurturing you just wait I want her to be my grandma not,0.12727225
saying that I don't love you grandma because you're my favorite grandma in the whole,0.06404188
wide world but she was great I was just like hey grandma I want you,0.07579036
to be okay like I don't want you to go nowhere but yeah like I,0.09468889
had a really great time watching the farewell I think that I learned a lot,0.025326202
about Chinese culture I didn't know that there was a thing where if you were,0.053102277
sick with a certain type of disease that instead of telling you the family chooses,0.20681557
not to tell them because they don't want fear to overcome and take them out,0.079830684
early you know a lot of people when they hear hear that they're sick it,0.14060518
does something to their mental state and they really give up before even beginning the,0.09515385
fight and so I felt as though that even though this movie is based on,0.08943793
a Chinese family I learned a lot about their culture but also too there were,0.045014307
a lot of ways that I was able to relate to their situation as someone,0.018878577
who I lost one of my grandmother's a couple of years ago I've lost my,0.03548555
father I found a way to relate to them the situation very relatable if no,0.012623855
one's gone through this I'm very happy that you haven't had to go through this,0.03635029
yet but also to seeing the generational differences as we see how her father deals,0.01983112
with this situation as her mom deals with this situation showing how people deal with,0.06906336
grief in different ways some people are very emotional one of the reasons in the,0.021123571
film they don't want some of the children to be around because they feel as,0.068391524
though they can't hide their emotions and even also to how we talk about those,0.013134051
who find it hard to deal with grief and to show grief and to show,0.032381807
emotion as dirt dilling you know with this sad circumstance but also to I did,0.05742131
enjoy the aspect of showing how you know Western culture versus Chinese culture is so,0.061931923
different because in America you know there's no way that you cannot tell someone that,0.048610955
they're sick or they're ill on vs. as Billy's trying to understand her Chinese culture,0.23020604
that this is a way of life this is what everyone does as she kind,0.07379481
of learns how to deal with the situation but if I had to say anything,0.029196905
bad about the film there are a few points in the film where the pacing,0.050041765
is a little off that the movie starts to fill I'm a little bit long,0.067111045
but it happens very few and far in between in the film but overall for,0.015645785
me I had a great time watching The Farewell I cried I laughed I cried,0.08397877
again and laughed again and it really felt like a therapeutic experience kind of watching,0.029858764
someone deal with this grieving process I'm even resonating bringing up some of some of,0.064321265
the different ways that I dealt with grief over the years of my life but,0.037917465
yeah what I would tell you guys to do with you and Gert coins for,0.04939188
the farewell I would tell you to pay this Cephas film in theaters aquafina blows,0.1861543
it out of the park a little um a little own way I can't wait,0.030567184
to see what she does next I think she's actually working on a sci-fi project,0.043234278
NYX but I had a very great time with a farewell I would recommend this,0.053243294
movie to everyone to go see it right now in theaters but those are my,0.018665053
thoughts on the farewell as always my name is sure honor from Pierre awaits and,0.04427795
