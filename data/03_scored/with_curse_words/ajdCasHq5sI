hey it's open social thoughts today we're going to be talking about patty Jenkins's Wonder,0.060241126
Woman starring gal gadot let me just say right off the bat that Wonder Woman,0.4641112
is not only the best DC film ever made but it's just a plain great,0.15274194
superhero movie and this is the first-ever first-ever Wonder Woman film the film really is,0.038193204
an origin story so before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana Princess of the,0.11328976
Amazon a trained warrior when a pilot crashes on her Island and tells her about,0.06988597
the war that's going on outside she feels like she needs to go out there,0.2101081
and help end this war to end all wars and out there she discovers her,0.2537366
true powers and her true destiny despite this film being a superhero movie it feels,0.12606655
very different from any other films we've seen there seems to be a lot more,0.08125442
hope compassion and humanity in this film and maybe that's because of our leading lady,0.24229202
Diana who comes into this world with abundance of love and hope only to realize,0.18342558
that the world is way more harsh than she initially realizes one of the most,0.17013563
powerful aspects of this film is that it shows you the casualties of war in,0.112283446
a brutally honest way without sugarcoating anything and really showing you the trauma behind it,0.31089434
like Captain America Wonder Woman is very idealistic she wants to save everyone and although,0.18313314
she comes off as a bit naive I think her biggest lesson that she learns,0.5876557
is that the world isn't so black and white and that everybody is fighting their,0.24201605
own battle and I think that message was one of the most unique aspects of,0.03691872
the film because as a superhero and you want you want to save everybody and,0.07226487
you can't and I think it's that inner turmoil but also facing that reality that,0.13276087
is very true and very real with its slow-mo action shots perfect comedic timing and,0.1180376
powerful message Wonder Woman delivers on all levels gal gadot is so dang beautiful every,0.25460377
shot she was in I was like holy crap girl she literally woke up like,0.8595287
the wrong thing so but who knows I loved her as Wonder Woman and I,0.14952734
can't wait to see what she does next in this second Hill she brings up,0.12958117
like a very powerful presence but also she's very vulnerable and I think that combination,0.15614852
very inspiring to see on screen because at times I feel like female characters can,0.08817189
only be very one-dimensional and I want to see it all I want and she,0.15160985
really brings it she is this powerful Amazon warrior and at the same time she,0.079323374
feels very conflicted and she is able to balance these two emotions very well and,0.06248082
I think that that one that's what me that is what makes her so heroic,0.13813382
and just plain beautiful I loved the character and I know I was kind of,0.08823981
bashing on Chris Pine for being and everything film and all my god and when,0.2399092
you see somebody else but he was really great in this and he was very,0.07678504
heroic in his own way and he brought he was a very good counterpart to,0.12535873
gal gadot's Wonder Woman they worked very well together and everything seemed not so natural,0.27014354
it wasn't forced and there are so many key moments so I was like wow,0.052455142
I would have never thought they would ever put this in a in a superhero,0.15670435
film especially when they just casually talked to get to know each other that was,0.039675876
one of the best things about this film and another one of the highlights for,0.057274166
me was the other cast Robin Wright at anti obey ng Opie Davis stoolies to,0.24197501
loose as Ares Harry Potter character coming back in Wonder Woman and he was so,0.10123881
powerful and then Eleanor anayia who was in all MOBA doors face as dr. Poisson,0.0904697
she was magnificent I wanted more of her she seemed so evil and yet like,0.61435884
such a real person and I think that that's what patty Jenkins did so well,0.19951889
in this film and they made all these villains and even good people real people,0.3069717
not just caricatures like I'm a villain and I I really appreciated that and we,0.1088489
these people exist somewhere out there and they're not just flat they embody so many,0.27229998
dimensions and body so many emotions and I loved I loved to not I don't,0.16538653
know about you but finally seeing a female superhero starring in their own film almost,0.16652343
seems so normal to me I know it's not but it did seem normal and,0.12012548
yet I understand how big of a deal this is and knowing that it was,0.061516955
such a proud and monumental moment to finally see this on the big screen I,0.06495665
know that there were parts I got teary-eyed especially when she enters no-man's land it's,0.21283688
such a powerful historic symbolic moment for not just the film itself and the story,0.03988881
behind it but for everybody else that's watching it it is very emotional and it's,0.07142638
one of the most iconic moments in the film that I I really just I,0.052952997
felt so again proud despite knowing that oh my god wonder what are you doing,0.05307497
don't go out there like it's no man's land and just the fact that she,0.14927489
did was incredibly inspiring I man I appreciated this film so much and sometimes it,0.09632953
kind of went into a cheesy territory with this message of hope and love but,0.10267395
honestly it's the kind of message we really need right now it's that cheesiness like,0.122533455
we need to up that cheesy factor because the world is not that great at,0.1613584
this moment and it's people like her a superhero like Wonder Woman who believes in,0.17700776
this cause so much about love and it's unlike any other superhero I've seen because,0.10503771
a lot of the superheroes we've seen are pretty jaded and for once we see,0.061574306
a person who is very sure of themselves despite all the that's going on around,0.08530254
them despite the war that she's in she's she feels OK and confident to be,0.17186306
like we can change this with love hope and all this great message I'm like,0.08798875
oh my god yes we can't we can't change it it just takes a lot,0.078636535
of face and a lot of man power or female woman power mine I say,0.31089434
let's replace that and yeah let me know what you guys thought of the silve,0.10335469
is and I absolutely loved it I can't wait to watch the sequel I know,0.11240442
it's domestically it surpassed 100 million dollars in the box office making it the most,0.056358065
gross film for any female director which honestly i Junkins did an incredible job I,0.43115774
also would like to see more fight scenes next time around and I just want,0.15918031
to see bigger better villains come to life yeah I have so much to say,0.24003069
but I think I said all that I can right now I have been a,0.036366217
big fan of Wonder Woman for a while and it's just such a pleasure to,0.16132635
finally see her in the big screen anyway thank you so much for tuning in,0.079009876
