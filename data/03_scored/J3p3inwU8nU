hello friends my name is steph cosa and it is time to talk about spiderman,0.0745882
into the spider-verse spider-man into the spider verse is an animated spider-man movie about Miles,0.1884008
Morales Miles Morales is one of the many people who has taken up the mantle,0.18943043
of spider-man and this movie follows the story of Miles as he becomes the spider-man,0.1544165
of his universe but then some sort of interdimensional happens and five other different spider,0.1262159
people all come into miles as universe and suddenly there's a bunch of spider men,0.40311918
spider people spider things so not only is Miles trying to figure out his own,0.15071546
powers and how to become his own Spider Man he's also dealing with all these,0.1485922
other spider people and trying to figure out what happened and how to send them,0.18989962
back and how to fix all the universes that are all melding together so there's,0.07692451
a lot happening in this movie it's kind of crazy and I loved it so,0.2781054
much first of all I love that we get an origin story of Spider Man,0.08492728
that we've never seen in a movie before because there have been a lot of,0.08578158
Spider Man movies at this point and it's like yeah we get it we know,0.09803095
the origin story of Peter Parker but nobody really knows the origin story of Miles,0.07492922
Morales unless you're like a huge comic book fan and he's read Miles Morales his,0.16924782
story but it was very refreshing and very cool to get a brand new origin,0.06070335
story for spider-man because Miles Morales is awesome I love him he's so lovable he's,0.13914992
such a great character I want so much more of him I'm so excited that,0.07020095
he has a movie and that it's a good movie I am just elated about,0.119182564
the existence of this film I also love that we get a lot of other,0.09930132
spider people in this movie like we do get Peter Parker we actually get two,0.1648402
different Peter Parker's one of which is probably my favorite character in the entire movies,0.028816873
played by Jake Johnson who I love a lot and he's basically from a dimension,0.088966906
where spider-man is kind of run down kind of old a little bit fat he's,0.5992532
kind of a shitty spider-man he's just not very good at it and I thought,0.9209315
that was such a cool perspective I love seeing a superhero just kind of being,0.052907858
a bum super relatable I am that spider-man and he was really funny I just,0.39571244
loved everything about him I would watch a whole movie of lame bum ass spider-man,0.855946
eating pizza on the couch sign me up for that we also get gwen stacy,0.15169889
voiced by Hailee Steinfeld who I and I also love gwen stacy she is such,0.14238302
a huge fan favorite i feel like ever since she was born into existence which,0.0970304
was only a few years ago she has just exploded like I've seen people cosplaying,0.25781623
her everywhere her costume is really cool she's just a really awesome character and I,0.098759964
love her and she's incredible in this movie just like a really determined badass superhero,0.17242582
who's just gonna get done and she's gonna kick some ass and she has a,0.9297864
little bit of sass and I love it and then on top of that we,0.19364868
also have spider-man noir who is a really cool character I just started reading the,0.1542818
spider-man 2 our comics just because of this movie because he's really cool and he's,0.13116437
voiced by Nicolas Cage which is amazing and he made me laugh so much I,0.07587508
loved it and of course if that wasn't enough we also get Peter porker the,0.15004644
pig the spider pig the one and only spider-ham voiced by John Mulaney which makes,0.4632667
it even better because he's so funny and I just think the casting for this,0.15872821
movie was perfect like I cannot think of one person to be any other person,0.27393782
like they were all just like that was that was it that was perfect could,0.07999344
not do any better I've also got to talk about the style of this movie,0.089044
the animation oh my god I don't think I have ever seen anything like this,0.119742945
in my life it was like it kind of looked like a comic book but,0.1755903
it was also a cartoon but it was mostly CG but it still had that,0.081688285
cartoon feel and like the way everything was shaded and colorized like it was just,0.10419998
so beautiful like even if the plot of this movie was terrible and everything about,0.27634934
it was terrible I probably still would have loved it just because visually it was,0.102763
incredible it was like watching a comic book come to life in a way that,0.1408224
I never thought was possible I think they did a really good job of introducing,0.09581194
a lot of new characters into one origin movie and not making it feel overcrowded,0.07909306
or confusing or off-balance I feel like the balance was perfect the pacing was perfect,0.049795043
I got a lot from every character even spider-ham I like felt some sort of,0.10143683
connection with like every single character Doc Ock kingpin like the villains were really good,0.19503191
in this movie there were also like three different villains which is a lot of,0.08061715
villains especially when you also have a large on sample cast of protagonists like there,0.114044674
are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of storylines going on,0.065036885
you have to kind of figure out in process and I felt like the balance,0.07167983
of those altogether was absolutely perfect I felt emotionally invested in every single spider person,0.10582667
I understood and even kind of felt for all 3 of the villains I got,0.12005003
enough of a backstory from Peter Parker and the other Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy,0.09717665
and miles and kingpin and everyone to be emotionally invested and care about them without,0.15498279
getting too much backstory it was like just enough to care about them and to,0.07022707
see them develop and there is character development across the board for like everyone and,0.06410834
on top of that there are some badass fight scenes in this movie like the,0.24167873
animation style combined with the action choreography and the soundtrack and the sound effects everything,0.06866541
was so much fun I had so much I had a blast watching this movie,0.14784054
I can 100% tell you that this will have great replay value like I remember,0.07196489
after the credits rolled I was like when's the next show good could we could,0.06263788
we go see it right now is that cool cuz it was just so much,0.061037805
fun and it was funny and it was heartfelt and it had a lot of,0.07472633
everything that a movie needs it checked all the boxes it fit all of the,0.056003205
parts it was charming it was funny it was action-packed it was entertaining from beginning,0.11067742
to end and it left you feeling good I think the best superhero movies are,0.10396548
the ones that when they're over you feel like you're a superhero too and that's,0.10650626
what this movie did for me I think that's one of the perks of spider-man,0.18536367
and any spider-man story it's always about an underdog and feeling like you're kind of,0.30103955
a loser and you don't really know how to be a hero but that you,0.7950439
can be a hero and this movie 100% gave me that effect and I just,0.04137786
loved every web-slinging second of it spider-man into the spider verse has so much heart,0.13687882
and I am giving it five stars 100% I don't think I've had a lot,0.060749494
of movies in 2018 there were five stars but this just absolutely blew me away,0.10449467
I was so surprised at how good this movie was and it's probably in my,0.082058266
top 5 of 2018 I loved it so much and I truly cannot think of,0.10144058
any flaws like there was nothing that I had a problem with I thought everything,0.13548748
was perfect could not have been more perfect to this movie I I loved it,0.1514796
I can't wait to see the next one there are already rumors that they're making,0.05946269
