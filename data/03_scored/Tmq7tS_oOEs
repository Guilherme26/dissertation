hey everybody it is october obviously the month of halloween so i figured i would,0.1544377
review a few horror movies and today i'm going to start with us this film,0.25077653
was it came out in 2019 and it was written and directed by jordan peele,0.08226393
jordan peel had a really fascinating rise to prominence in hollywood he began of course,0.10522275
as a comedian as a writer and an actor in sketch comedy he got a,0.1646025
start more in mad tv and then eventually he rises up the sketch comedy ranks,0.10131967
once he partners with keegan michael key for the sketch comedy show key and peel,0.056109022
and then out of nowhere he makes his directorial debut with get out which i,0.24006642
don't need to tell you was a huge hit and it was widely critically acclaimed,0.27533635
it really touched a nerve with audiences because of how it delved into social commentary,0.08327585
in a way that people weren't used to in mainstream horror commentary on class and,0.15344328
racism and identity but from the point of view of a black man and i,0.7071857
think that's what jordan peele wants to be known for at least for now he,0.088003606
wants to take the idea of horror which is of course an iconic genre for,0.15051806
audiences and then subvert those expectations by giving us an unlikely point of view and,0.08925692
as a result he has a lot of power now he's considered to be one,0.06881629
of the big rising auteurs it's a meteoric rise for sure and i think a,0.1665127
lot of people were just really thrown off they were surprised that some guy that,0.15529156
was known for acting and sketch comedy and writing and stuff like that could suddenly,0.0962892
write this this horror movie but for me i didn't think it was that much,0.1547843
of a stretch because get out is more of a social commentary it's kind of,0.058951538
satirical but it has horror elements but i always saw it more as like a,0.13605869
hority and i always loved his philosophy he always believed that there's a really thin,0.15186612
line between making somebody laugh and and making somebody scared and i think he's absolutely,0.24145132
right they're you know totally different reactions at the end of the spectrum but often,0.048758607
humor can be blind with it you know like humor can be used as a,0.08905228
defense mechanism for fear or sometimes in really tense terrifying moments a strange humor can,0.059580103
come out of it so when they kind of bleed together that's when things get,0.18360566
really interesting especially when you can't differentiate the two that's where the crux of the,0.08310201
horror lies for jordan peele and i think he's wonderful at expressing it if you,0.42119744
watch sketches in key and peel you can absolutely see that element of like eeriness,0.0764569
and horror elements where the humor takes a kind of a sharp turn into unexpected,0.24138609
dark territory i'm thinking personally of course of sketches like megan and andre they're hilarious,0.15537718
but there are major elements of of tragedy and darkness there too like a you,0.11543958
know manipulation and abusive relationships and and megan is a terrifying but realistic villain and,0.25040275
i don't know i felt like get out kind of was an extension of that,0.12704423
just more fully developed and more interesting of course it's one of the few american,0.092397876
mainstream movies in recent memory to be really well structured as in i see almost,0.07331879
no fact to trim the payoffs are clear the arcs are really really strong overall,0.13771388
and there's just something very refreshing about that however when i watched the movie i,0.06571584
liked it but i felt like there was something missing i i felt like okay,0.11079729
this is a good start but i'm very intrigued to see what you're gonna do,0.077753
next because i felt as strong as the story was there wasn't a real style,0.09917932
and a sense of tone that matched that i wanted something more cinematic so he,0.094189875
follows that up rather quickly with us and you know i think that he it's,0.07793614
kind of a tough thing when you make a movie that starts off so high,0.09874681
you have a lot of expectation behind you how do you recreate a cultural moment,0.18708372
like that can you recreate it to me i think you should just move on,0.23472257
and try to do something different and not get kind of crippled under that expectation,0.18070719
but when i look at us i kind of wonder to myself did he truly,0.06318699
succeed with it i mean i think it depends on how you look at it,0.09243834
i think in some ways yes he did improve on certain aspects of get out,0.12911664
in other ways he didn't we have another horror movie here that is like get,0.15173994
out it's very socially politically aware where it's focusing more on the divide between classes,0.0943318
and like assimilation and trying to discover your identity when it is so attached to,0.08810233
your skin color or rather maybe how your skin color is attached to the environment,0.48403698
you grew up in is maybe a better way to say it conceptually on a,0.154653
basic level i think us is really intriguing and really interesting i really like the,0.05662226
concept behind the tethered having these doppelgangers these copies of the original person that represent,0.1850487
the lower class and how like the privileges of the rich are always depriving the,0.1901234
poor also that guilt haunts the rich and the privileged and just the idea you,0.25856838
know that like every bite that you take a child somewhere is starving and there's,0.37522477
always that underlying thing that we know but we rarely face the consequences of that,0.081918806
but unfortunately when you have like the upper class and you have like you know,0.19790977
reality the world as it exists on the outside all of that is is fine,0.075643584
it exists as it does but then i look at the world of the tethered,0.06945637
which is of course underground and again i like the concept but i feel like,0.0480384
it doesn't make a lot of logistical sense and it doesn't feel nearly as fully,0.068281025
formed as as as this world up here however stylistically i think this movie is,0.1177735
really cool it's definitely very cinematic compared to get out and there's a lot of,0.08765875
detail in the aesthetic that i appreciate and i just love the color palette it,0.05170098
has this rich almost like aged technicolor quality there was a lot of thought clearly,0.09299304
that went into the mood of the film and how they decide to build the,0.039438773
suspense elements and all of that really captured my attention particularly in the opening sequence,0.062546134
i love when adelaide is on the beach and she's going into the fun house,0.14520475
with the mirrors and you know having the mirrors be that metaphor for that snap,0.07377367
from reality into those metaphors is something that we see a lot and i mean,0.068140656
yes you could say that it is quite cliche but i felt it was really,0.05282106
well directed here and peel seems to be taking a lot of recycled cliches and,0.17758605
again subverting them using familiar tropes but from a different point of view the score,0.054813176
is fabulous and i rarely say that about modern movies today especially modern horror movies,0.15473713
uh and you know has that coral quality to it which is very kind of,0.07945449
spiritual and soulful and haunting but then there's this weird texture and a kind of,0.15672266
an edginess to the instrumentation throughout and i think at times the way that he,0.17777075
explores humor in this movie is really really clever and when everything in his world,0.20683448
just feels a little bit exaggerated it makes everything a little bit more creepy like,0.33991784
david lynch in a lot of ways you know like the tethered they're like these,0.40314627
resurfaced harlequin dolls or something or like clowns from the 1950s out for revenge against,0.46509546
the people who maybe dismissed them lupita young while i don't necessarily think that her,0.34461877
performance here is especially amazing or anything like that i just think she has an,0.25896326
extraordinary face and body that is just pure power and it's very very cinematic she,0.16364686
has just such beautiful skin but these eyes that pop out and really express a,0.21363254
lot of emotion and that is perfect for the horror genre but as the tethered,0.0851272
version of herself or whatever you want to say there she does a fantastic job,0.11242323
her eyes are bugging out and she is so terrifying and everything is very accented,0.49324322
where it's right on the edge and you don't know what she's going to do,0.15178607
at any moment that feral quality to her movements is very interesting and she's she's,0.27965453
got a great physicality and clearly she's a very good dancer and it's really brilliant,0.22518648
to watch i think really that's lucid and young's strength a lot of times is,0.060563292
her physicality and the voice she uses you know it's it's like this feels like,0.1831709
it's croaking she's trying to croak her dialogue and there's a real tragedy to that,0.15015545
she's fighting and there's a pain to it but also this vengeful nature to it,0.540808
as well it's very over the top it feels like like i like to say,0.094195075
a lot of times right on the edge of farce like kabuki theater or something,0.3652872
yet it thrives in this particular world in the same way that you know like,0.058930747
jack torrance thrives in in the shining in kubrick's universe elizabeth moss is the highlight,0.15033816
for me but she she always is i just love her i i enjoyed that,0.13044162
aspect of the movie having this small insight into another family the white family's point,0.31089434
of view how adelaide or lupita younggo's husband in the movie is you know he,0.14903772
wants to be the man this paternal force he's trying to provide for his family,0.07091106
yet he feels this competition to have all the nice things like you know elizabeth,0.08895218
moss's family and i enjoy that aspect of assimilation that's where it really comes out,0.05543571
and connecting the families based on that but when you look at elizabeth moss and,0.054798413
her family do they seem happy at all no they seem much less connected than,0.24005514
adelaide's family they all seem to hate each other they're and their their privilege has,0.55216277
made them weak and distant and just ungrateful they think they're above little inconveniences but,0.3456765
i really like moss also as her tethered version of herself i really don't know,0.27333394
how to how to say that but you know what i mean it's really really,0.088941984
creepy i like it because it is a twisted version of the real version of,0.28869045
herself and all the elements of that come out in the conversation at the beginning,0.08111928
of the movie when they're on the beach where she's having that discussion with adelaide,0.109178916
she talked about all the things that she wished for had she wanted to be,0.15277286
an actress but then she ended up getting married and having kids and she's just,0.15900312
bitter about the life that she chose she's one of those women who feels like,0.3833605
oh the best years are behind me like she's some sort of like tennessee williams,0.24195927
southern heroine there's a line where she says she got plastic surgery and she says,0.18128447
to adelaide oh no but you you don't need plastic surgery and you know maybe,0.15396178
there's a little bit of jealousy there because you know lupita nyong'o is kind of,0.24233362
a like a one-of-a-kind beauty that jealousy that we saw in get out is kind,0.17075735
of resurfacing here i think but i think it all comes out through the very,0.09629907
distorted tether version of her and how she is still theatrical where she's literally a,0.25449908
laugh away from a tear and that might be one of the most haunting images,0.11773334
in the movie for me she goes over to cut adelaide you know with the,0.089630805
scissors and she has the taste and she just can't do it and then she,0.24231207
goes over and does it to herself i'll awesome sort of like black dahlia thing,0.29805794
and i love it i love it and i guess i just really find that,0.03308503
interesting just like the bridge between the doppelgangers and their personality traits their their subconscious,0.28151023
but the whole threat of the unconscious mind for all of us is that we're,0.19083747
afraid that you know certain toxic angry aspects of ourselves are are going to take,0.2415546
over the parts of us that are more healthy and balanced and here all of,0.053363744
that is represented through the metaphor of just anarchy and and the idea that class,0.08880047
separation is becoming wider and wider between the rich and the poor based on the,0.12947805
powers that be and the real threat is the people who are experiencing that and,0.15230857
are images of the tethered and how they're standing and they're ready and they're holding,0.101653665
hands as though it is some sort of protest that's really powerful and yet when,0.029482957
you look closer it just doesn't like i said before it doesn't make logical sense,0.17032242
especially in the third act the reveal of this experiment that's gone awry is just,0.068664715
it's it's half baked unfortunately i love the look of it it reminded me a,0.11026303
lot of the third act of i'm thinking of ending things just this idea of,0.15390548
of uh this weird sort of surrealistic void where the self-actualization is going to take,0.26347223
place the melding of two aspects of consciousness finding the whole in this case it,0.052337114
would be adelaide and then the tethered version of her when there is the switch,0.1033652
which is of course you know like the big twist of the movie where we,0.06434548
realized that the real adelaide is the one that got switched and then her tethered,0.1510543
version is the one living among us why would she feel the need to mimic,0.14905523
what's happening above when she's the real person that wasn't really explained why is the,0.07997242
mirroring happening at certain times and then not at others so i think this is,0.09990998
something that maybe maybe peel thought about in his mind but it just doesn't really,0.08927171
translate is he trying to infer something and maybe i'm just i'm just not getting,0.09817226
it or is he is this more kind of a lazy way to create a,0.24232204
plot convenience and don't get me wrong i love the twist i really do i,0.10207977
think it's absolutely fantastic i think it's absolutely tragic in concept but it doesn't work,0.09390095
fully when you think about again the logic behind everything and therefore it loses a,0.12653154
bit of its power so it feels like just kind of a device that's used,0.09761434
more as a specific twist to change the story up in a way naturally i'm,0.060466208
less logic driven just as a person just that's how my mind works and so,0.10906089
i'm a big believer most times of suspension of disbelief in movies but when you,0.112264514
have a world like this that depends so much on logic and how your underground,0.1549474
counterpart is is feeling the repercussions of things and how it's all connected i i,0.086653754
think you really need to be kind of clear about that world the world building,0.17399988
that way the payoff that big twist at the end could be fully realized and,0.069385104
be opened up because as it stands the twist doesn't take us in any interesting,0.15159552
direction it just kind of solidifies the point about you know what it means to,0.07234209
you know have to break a few eggs to make an omelette and it's really,0.3175568
frustrating because there's so much here that i really enjoy and that i'm naturally just,0.18474324
just drawn to and i i do think this could have been great i think,0.0868662
it could have been as good as get out i think it could have been,0.12400953
better than get out but key aspects of it crumble under just the whole nonsensicalness,0.13725917
of what's going on here overall i still like it i do think it's a,0.10202898
cool movie i think it's an entertaining movie i think it's got style and it's,0.15544336
got passion and it's trying to say something more i love peel's world i love,0.15173423
the tone of it and i'm excited to see what he can pull out of,0.12994488
it whether he you know explores more in the horror genre or whatever so while,0.10543444
it is very uneven i still think it's worth your time i definitely do recommend,0.15397047
it but i will say that same year parasite came out and i think if,0.4529327
you want to watch a movie that really takes the ideas of class struggle and,0.14059414
like privileged guilt and lack thereof and and the vengeance of the lower class watch,0.25119242
parasite it takes those ideas in a much more clever direction and it's just a,0.42977163
stronger stronger more fully realized film but get out is a really fun movie especially,0.08352485
for halloween but that is my review thank you guys so much for watching i,0.083723605
