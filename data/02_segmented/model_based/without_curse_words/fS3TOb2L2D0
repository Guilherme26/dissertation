I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it in time to see this movie because the Amc near me didn't have it anymore
"The Regal didn't have it, So I thought you know what, I'm gonna have to probably just wait until it's on streaming"
"But thanks to smaller theatres like Afi, I was able to catch this one just in time"
"The farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars Aquafina as Billy, Billy has just learned that her grandma is dying and her family is gonna go visit her, but they don't want to tell her grandma that she's dying, so they make up an excuse that there's a wedding happening in the family, so that everybody can come together and see her one last time"
"Two things interested me about this movie, one, the premise and to seeing Aquafina in a more serious role, because usually she does more over-the-top comedic roles and I think it was definitely interesting to see her do something different"
Overall
I would say the Ferrell was a great time
"There was great performances, beautiful cinematography and really good balance between comedy and drama, so let's get into it"
so it worked
First and foremost
This movie looked great from the cinematography to the locations
I think somebody's just very visually appealing
They shot it on location in China and New York
So you get a lot of great cityscapes
"Another thing that really stood out to me, where the performances in this movie, especially Aquafina"
I think she really carried this movie again
"We're not used to seeing her in serious roles, so I think this is really refreshing and I think she killed it"
"She did great playing this granddaughter who had to act like everything was okay, but really it was it because she, along with her family were the only ones that really knew what was going on, while her grandma was just kind of going on about"
"you know, having time of her life as if life goes on, because again she doesn't know, so I think that balance was really interesting, that dynamic, and seeing how everybody's being affected by this tragedy or potential tragedy in their family, Speaking of which, the grandma, played by a Xu Xin Zhao, I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly was also amazing"
"Her dynamic with Awkwafina's character, Billy was really what drove this movie"
She was very energetic
She was very funny and I think it made even more tragic to see her going about her life
"But then we, the audience and the family know that her time is running short"
"Also, I think this movie was generally funny, even though the subject"
The premise is kind of sad and dark
I think they did manage to find some nice moments to have some comedy between the family members
seeing them play off of each other
"I think that really made this movie entertaining, and it really made me fall in love with these characters"
But what I think worked the most for me and this would be what I think really sold
"It was how they explored the ethics of the situation and seeing them go back and forth arguing whether they're right or wrong to not tell her grandma that she's dying, And they mentioned in the movie like in America, This wouldn't fly"
"They would definitely make them tell, or the doctor would be obligated to tell the grandma"
"Yes, you have cancer"
"You're dying, But in China they believe no, you should let these people live the rest of their lives happy, and not till the very last minute that they should tell her the truth, And so, seeing this back and forth between the family members, I think, really kept me intrigued"
seeing their different perspectives
"There's also an interesting discussion about immigration in this movie where there's two sides of the family, There are people that stayed in China and those who left to find better jobs, better education for their children, better opportunity"
"And we see a clash between these two sides, and they're kind of arguing on who made the right call"
"who's really doing what's best for their family in the family as a whole, And I thought that was a really interesting conflict they added to this movie"
The only thing I can think of that could have been done a little bit better in this movie was the ending
"Now, there is a part where they do wrap up the story with the grandma"
"Well, and I think they did a great job of wrapping up things with the family, But then there's one scene in towards the end where it kind of just ends and then there's something in the credits and then you're like Okay, I get it now, but I think they definitely could have done something within that scene to really tie everything together and really wrap it up"
But otherwise I think this was a great movie
"The verdict, I think this movie was a good time"
"The Farewell offers great performances, beautiful scenery cinematography"
It also has a lot of great messages about ethics and teaches a lot about Chinese culture
So I think there's a lot to get from this movie and it's definitely worth seeing in theaters
"But if you don't catch as theaters, of course, you can always try and find out in streaming or just go buy the Dvd"
So have you seen the farewell? What did you think? Let me know
