hi Shane here you're watching Sam for God's this is March check around so hi,0.066758856
guys how you doing today I will talk about a film that I've been wanting,0.18490691
and waiting to see for so long I can't speak to how excited I was,0.09210738
for it to finally come out of the UK because it came out in the,0.14800473
UK about a month and a half dated in America which what is this like,0.10143758
why does America get everything early anyway I'm the 24th of July 2015 Pixar's new,0.06071896
film inside out finally came out of the UK and I went to watch it,0.12000452
that same day it was a Friday and I absolutely loved it okay so if,0.06730541
you've read anything about inside out you'd probably know that this film has been getting,0.25478235
positive reviews after positive reviews after positive reviews hardly anyone in fact there having been,0.042905018
a single negative review about this movie and so I was very excited about seeing,0.16427137
it because I was like whoa everybody is giving this film like amazing reviews I,0.1436202
was also a bit apprehensive because I was like surely there must be at least,0.19382949
something wrong with a film like this movie can't be so good that no one,0.14323556
said anything bad about it so I went in hoping for the best but also,0.09464592
being open to things I didn't like in the film there weren't any the film,0.051688764
is perfect if you didn't know inside-out is about a girl called Riley she's like,0.23492011
11 or something and she moves away she moves from like one place to another,0.26441258
to another state or whatever she actually moved to San Francisco which I thought was,0.056043863
really cool because I've been San Francisco I mean like San Francisco so it was,0.061946712
cool to see that in the film but she doesn't like it fair enough you,0.1565959
know she's young it's not really easy moving from one place to another because like,0.10719866
she didn't have her friends anymore she doesn't live in her old house where she,0.18988208
liked her room and whatnot so the whole room is a bit difficult on her,0.18171702
and yeah basically if we go inside Whitey's brain and find out how her brain,0.76850104
is controlled doing this move it's genius it's the coolest thing basically the main characters,0.083556615
in the film involve characters like joy and sadness and anger and fear and disgust,0.22263667
and the movie is just so unique so original and I honestly wasn't sure how,0.070371464
they were gonna play out like because they is quite difficult you know you go,0.098817796
back and forth between seeing Riley in her life and then seeing the emotions in,0.09324746
her brain but they did a great job at it like there were no moments,0.43255404
of boredom no moments of confusion it was just done very very well what I,0.079751626
love most about the film is that it's just so clever and it's so deep,0.07672021
it's so meaningful there are so many underlying themes go on and it's something that,0.05866671
I genuinely think adults would enjoy more than children like kids can go and watch,0.31308904
the film and like it because it's entertaining and funny and there's loads of colors,0.077203505
in the film but they probably won't understand the deeper meanings behind the film and,0.05126001
those are the things that adults going to watch the film would notice and they'd,0.04398303
be amazed by them like I was if you're actually in psychology even just a,0.14867298
little bit you're gonna love this film because it just goes inside your brain and,0.68117297
it explains how brains work in a very unique way obviously that's not necessarily how,0.2529008
brains actually work this is fiction this is a fictional story it's a fictional film,0.23667207
but it's just so clever and unique and amazing ingenious how they've come up with,0.07826409
this system like it's a whole system in your head according to this film and,0.21046135
all these emotions are like characters who like have to work hard every day to,0.0744636
make sure you know your levels of emotions are like balance and everything oh I,0.0823007
just loved it so much every single character in the film and there's loads of,0.03785067
them was great to watch there weren't any annoying people there's actually one character called,0.31089434
Bing bong and he easily could have been annoying like I remember watching him at,0.1879248
some point and thinking to myself why am I not annoyed that this character because,0.069948964
he did some things and he said some things that could have become a bit,0.084631585
annoying but somehow they don't seem annoying like you still absolutely love Bing bong and,0.46709526
Bing bong the character Bing bong is actually one of the reasons that I cried,0.09093697
a lot during the film because there are some emotional sad moments I'm not going,0.06473373
to spoil for you but yeah there was one point involving Bing bong that made,0.11036409
me literally cry like a baby it was ugly crying it was the most I've,0.5876557
cried missing him in a very long time they've got joy is probably my favorite,0.104493864
character just because I related to her I'm somebody who normally likes even very happy,0.0783366
and joyful and tries to see the best in every situation and tries to make,0.05616537
everyone feel happy like I don't like sadness which is kind of what joy is,0.11088156
about the character of joy of the feeling of joy and to like whenever something,0.054347165
sad all that happens instead of like being sad I like to avoid it and,0.15126614
like tell people to not be sad and just be happy again which in the,0.30634525
film you learn that that's not necessarily the best thing to do sometimes you need,0.11515239
sadness you know in your life sometimes it's good to have a bit of a,0.1891323
cry or just feel sad for a while oh it's just so clever thinking about,0.15541185
it just makes me you think like whoa it was amazing sadness has the character,0.09864665
was was awesome again she does quite a lot of annoying things in the film,0.19128756
like in the beginning I was like I'm not sure if I'm gonna like her,0.15170911
but as a film went on I was like she's awesome she's apps the awesome,0.078055136
she made me laugh a lot she was just the voice I'm acting as well,0.2755381
as done really well in the film throughout the whole film every single character was,0.019001924
brilliant there isn't a villain in the film which is another thing I like in,0.06530602
a lot of films especially kids films there always seems to be a villain that,0.15711482
the protagonist of the film has to go and fight against or something but inside,0.084814794
out does not have a villain they go on an adventure but the adventure doesn't,0.08536176
have to do anything with a villain it's just things happen and they get to,0.15289044
a point where they have to solve things basically I actually have some of their,0.054906238
inside-out characters with me right now in tsumtsum form so we've got joy over here,0.10717725
she looks pretty joyful they've got sadness she looks really sad lesser or blue and,0.45886758
sad this is fear it was actually one of the funnier characters in the film,0.056434743
they've got anger looks pretty angry I'd say and this guy's is Bing bong who,0.5551534
I talked to you about earlier yep he's like a half elephant half something else,0.3101629
kind of thing I'm not gonna give anything away but yeah this is Bing bong,0.09929405
taking off steam assumes actually if you want me to do a tsumtsum collection video,0.26547015
at some point do you leave a comment down below and let me know anyway,0.17218848
back to the film um honestly I was so amazed by it I loved it,0.052916437
so much I loved so much there are so many funny moments in the film,0.06895001
so many great lines for visuals are just amazing like ah Pixar Pixar just knows,0.045880303
how to make films like I'm probably one of the biggest Pixar fans out there,0.1551467
as much as I love Disney with Pixar it's just something else I've always preferred,0.06453153
what Pixar do to what Disney does without big star and they just did it,0.08759542
with this film like it's been a long time since Pixar Sports out of film,0.12804484
that's good as inside out I will say it's probably as good as Toy Story,0.14857551
1 or at least nearly as good as that and that's a lot coming for,0.06894553
me because I adore Toy Story I think it's one of the best films ever,0.14867315
made be it inside out especially in terms of originality and uniqueness is probably Pixar's,0.08715711
best film I'd say it was just awesome I could not find any faults with,0.10486872
their like just go and see it please go and see it I mean you,0.15591833
don't really need me to tell you to go and see you probably already have,0.12737134
seen it yourself because it's doing really well everyone's saying good thing about it but,0.11209565
even if you're not a fan of Disney and Pixar give this one the girl,0.1909246
because it played with my emotions I cried I laughed it was just for me,0.088905625
I say he's probably the best film I've seen in 2015 and I've seen a,0.048629604
lot of films this year like I don't know if you remember or not but,0.088902205
one of my name is resolutions was to watch as many films as I could,0.07763415
this year and I have my mom's a member in the cinema the cinema so,0.15915313
I get to go free quite a lot so I've seen so many different films,0.08217089
since January of this year different kinds of films have been join us and stuff,0.07808684
but oh my god inside that was the best one I've seen so far it's,0.05785032
definitely gonna be an Oscar like no doubt it was just done so cleverly like,0.09352063
I came home and I could not stop thinking about it and I loved every,0.12427028
single character and also I want to mention lava as well lava was the short,0.05241943
Pixar film before inside out in case you didn't know any Pixar film that comes,0.09763296
out in the cinema has a short piece of film that precedes it before that,0.07051005
and I've seen knows a great short Pixar films but um yeah novel was a,0.10506253
really good one not the best one not the best short to pick something I've,0.11459082
seen but it was so good like it was so cute there's a song if,0.08008518
you've seen the film if you've seen things I haven't seen are but you know,0.06279603
which is on I'm talking about but the whole short film is basically taught through,0.064095974
a song a ukulele song a very simple song but a very effective and cute,0.0962217
song and that goes something like I have a dream I'm not going to sing,0.11463071
it for you but just look it up if you want but it's such a,0.09141527
cute song and it's a very basic story which is why I don't thing is,0.07992155
one of the best short Pixar films and because normally you know the short film,0.14006661
short because of films have a twist and there was something just one didn't you,0.07916173
have a twist it was quite predictable but it was still so cute I felt,0.1017579
emotional I felt emotional for two volcanoes guys the story is about volcanoes if you,0.11461715
couldn't tell by the name lava and I felt sorry and sad for them what,0.060184624
