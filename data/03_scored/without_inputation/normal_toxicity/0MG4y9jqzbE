hi welcome to movie review mom today the movie I'm reviewing is book smart it is rated R it's 105 minutes and the grade that I gave it is a D for disgusting teenagers this movie is garbage from a mom's perspective,0.794439
this coming-of-age movie is just trash,0.733693
every single Gen Z teenager featured in this film lives in the gutter seriously I mean I know I'm a mom right,0.2411994
so this is my perspective but other than wanting to get into a good college none of these teenagers seem to have any moral or good behavior at all,0.21563716
their language is filthy they do drugs,0.7093121
they engage in underage drinking they're disrespectful to adults and to each other they trash talk everything and everybody and are constantly looking to hook up with someone,0.5518057
that's not not my idea of a fun insightful comedy even of teenagers today,0.09844688
so beautiful Olivia Wilde has her directorial debut and she gives us a wild movie indeed she said that some of the teen flicks from the 80s and 90s were her inspirations such as The Breakfast Club Fast Times at Ridgemont High and clueless,0.1655132
and I guess she just decided to turn these carefree movies into rated R garbage this movie actually would make me really worried for the future,0.4905637
if I thought every teenager was like this except that I know many good teens who are not like the type of teens that are represented in this movie and it frustrated me because they didn't even have like in movies like this they'll often have like the token Christian goodie two-shoe kids that everybody makes fun of who was such a dork right they didn't even offer that it just made it,0.5596913
seem like every teenager sleeping around and doing all of these horrible things and that they're just jerks like I didn't really like any of the character well there were there were a couple that I liked but even still it just seemed to me to paint a very sideways picture of teenagers today I just think that there's so much better than what this movie portrayed so some tips for parents first of all,0.7363944
it's rated R,0.07924965
there are no role models in this movie even the teachers at the school are not necessarily good role models because they sleep with their students and they drink and they swear and they're disrespectful and you know,0.1860811
and I'm like give me at least a good teacher,0.22062542
even nothing in this movie and I recognize it's comedy or it's supposed to be a comedy but come on anyway back to the tips for parents,0.13692836
so there's lots of profanity crude language and so many f-bombs,0.42874792
now I know teenagers drop f-bombs like crazy but you know it,0.6026942
I don't know I just I don't need to hear it,0.09621718
and I know a lot of teenagers who don't use language like that so again it just seemed very stilted anyway we never see Molly's parents in the movie ever Amy's parents appear a couple of times but they're so afraid of parenting her that she basically does anything that she wants with no discipline no restrictions no consequences for her behavior,0.082994655
and the parents are trying so hard to be cool and hip and liked that they're not parenting,0.124867685
and so again no good parenting role models either,0.0665667
I mean they're nice,0.06753042
and I like both of the actors but just terrible role models,0.23876724
there are a couple of gay guys,0.7538821
there are some lesbians who actually go at it in the bathroom at a party there's talk of other things that people do there's lots of premarital sex Hege pinky talk of masturbation all that kind of stuff it's just super awkward there's drugs and alcohol to girls watch porn,0.820702
so funny right I just think that's so stupid a bunch of teens swim in their underwear at a party nobody seems to bat and I even these like shy kids are just like ripping off their clothes okay you could not never have paid me money to do that as a teenager now social justice warriors will think that this movie is bold and brilliant because everybody is trying to be so politically correct to give equal time to everybody which is great,0.69542736
but you can do it in a better way,0.08631856
I think anyway and this is yet one more movie about female empowerment and it it shows just that men are dismissed as useless or sexual objects,0.6812521
there's no good strong male role models,0.2038553
either,0.019159777
I do like the dad he's very sweet,0.08509047
he tries to communicate which is great,0.09070037
but again he's also a little afraid of his daughter in that regard the bad behavior is portrayed just as though everybody does it,0.15261582
and nobody bats an eye nobody thinks it's wrong even the premise of the movies that Molly and Amy worked hard all throughout their high school years to get into a good college with their good grades,0.08969661
but then they learn that they could have partied all those years like everybody else at the high school and that would have been a better use of their time,0.05217977
so now they're trying to make up for lost time,0.11402082
and it's just ridiculous not everybody parties in high school either and not every party has to be filled with alcohol and drugs and sex,0.75730175
I am just saying,0.051027905
there's also a scene where guys and girls are all in one bathroom at a high school,0.24085538
and I'm I'm thinking is that a thing at high school now I mean the unisex bathroom thing I don't know I used to teach at high school,0.09993898
and we didn't have that,0.0662783
so I don't know what's going on some themes positive themes,0.11116809
are I really like the very beginning of the movie because Molly wakes up and she hears these recordings that are these positive affirmations,0.1104834
and so one is greatness takes sacrifice,0.15169428
and so that's her mantra really throughout high school is that she's sacrificing her young free-wheeling days and she's putting her nose to the grindstone and she's studying hard so that she can get into a good college right,0.29683292
so she hears that kind of talk at the beginning of her day,0.10543142
and she's committed to it,0.10771357
that's impressive behavior actually and then certainly friendship between these two girls and some other people although they they're kind of I mean they're very very tight and almost exclusive while they are exclusive to other people,0.18562652
they yeah they want to around but nobody can really crack that deep friendship that they have it,0.08181608
I think that's great to have a best friend but I think friendships should allow more people into their circle in that sense that you know everybody needs to feel loved and wanted anyway some things that I did like our beanie Feldstein and Katelyn Deaver they're the two teenage girls and they both really did a fantastic job,0.10737214
I think beanie did she was just the highlight of all of the scenes when she was on scene Katelyn was a little bit more shy and subdued although she's the lesbian wanting to have sex with various girls,0.80120033
but anyway they did a good job with the material I laughed when Molly corrected the grammar on the bathroom graffiti,0.117787346
I've never done that,0.074036784
but I've always wanted to you because I'm a little bit of a grammar nazi,0.5772611
so I thought that was kind of funny,0.085027896
and then the adults in the movie include comedians and funny man Jason Sudeikis Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte there's a reference to Malala in the movie in fact,0.11527369
it's a code word that the two girls use and they think it's really clever,0.2047268
and everyone should see that the movie he named me Malala and be inspired or at least read the book,0.08146808
and so I loved that there was some intelligence behind and some thought mind that the code word that the girls had with each other however so much of the rest of the humor was not intelligent or clever humor,0.31089434
and I thought with a name like brain smart I'd be book smart that they should have been a little smarter especially in their choices anyway I liked watching everyone get a water balloon in the face during the closing credits,0.24174953
I thought that was a cute way to have the closing credits play and it if it weren't for the constant flood of f-bombs which were just so annoying,0.445142
I mean I get one every now and then for emphasis but it's just a constant onslaught some of the dialogue is actually amusing and even quotable - all the profanity that's in almost every sentence in the movie so annoying and producer Dan the Automator composed the score for this,0.108914614
music and they thought that they they did a really good job matching the lyrics for the moment just to kind of illustrate it and emphasize what was happening either to these two girls in particular or other characters,0.084858686
so I did thought I did think that that was good some other things that I didn't like is that like I said it's just not that funny and it seemed like this script was written more for shock value more for than for actual clever humor,0.14238232
and Billie lourd who plays Gigi is just her characters just a total psycho,0.63499165
who's really more pathetic than funny,0.850935
and you know I I just anyway she says bug me I mean,0.26676524
she did a good job with the role but she also looked like she was in her 20s and not a high school,0.1511256
in fact almost,0.035889626
all of the teenagers look like it had been maybe years since they were in high school,0.09983714
some of the teachers that we meet at the high school have potty mouths and they act done professionally,0.375233
I mentioned that before and you know one movie that I thought that had a better cast because they looked younger is the movie eighth grade it's also filled with a lot of profanity,0.13045768
and some of the things that I didn't really like but if you're if you like this movie I think that you'll really like that movie and I thought that that one was actually well better done,0.0883456
but still good for Olivia Wilde for going from being beautiful actress to now directing a movie,0.1624281
so kudos to her alright that's it for today be sure to hit the subscribe button and thanks for visiting the site,0.10957207
I love it when you guys comment and tell me what you thought of the movie I recognize not everybody's going to agree,0.15299124
and of course I'm talking from a mom's perspective I would not want my kids to see this movie and certainly not act,0.24874203
like any of the teenagers in this movie anyway that's my two cents bye for,0.093795285
now,0.031218953
you,0.10154687
