good morning in the afternoon everyone i am dorm this is dorm shoes welcome back,0.053510837
to dorm film where we're talking about movies uh today we're gonna be talking about,0.10016479
a night at the opera this movie's from 1935 and boy does it show it,0.08651374
uh so i literally just watched this i finished watching it as i was eating,0.24892855
dinner and came in here to record this immediately after i have a bit of,0.0781885
mixed feelings on this one there there's a lot to like about it there's also,0.07392996
a lot for me personally that just kind of i kind of lost the plot,0.1747484
a little bit so uh this movie is a marx brothers festival i guess because,0.1872357
groucho chico and harpo are all in this i'm a big fan of groucho marx,0.5079756
i was when i was like a teenager anyway just like reading his quotes and,0.10395798
stuff i don't know that i've ever watched a full groucho marx like film i've,0.370358
definitely watched clips and stuff on youtube but don't know that i've ever actually sat,0.08919243
down to watch a full garage remarks film this film also is on the afi,0.1104824
top 100 list that we were discussing last time with the apartment uh this is,0.02854522
number 85 on that list and to say that it's one of the 100 greatest,0.07864194
films of all time for me personally i don't really get it i really love,0.10352858
groucho marx and i think he is at his most brilliant when it's very dialogue,0.36778352
heavy one of the knocks on this film for me is how little dialogue there,0.091875836
is there are large sort of swaths of movie that are just either songs which,0.082375325
to me weren't very entertaining or just like musical breaks or uh sort of more,0.09870075
like slapstick physical comedy that stuff is great and i don't i don't hate those,0.31089434
kind of things but when i came into it expecting like a big groucho marx,0.4864353
movie and it starts out so great with just groucho marx just doing a lot,0.26354322
of dialogue in the first probably 10-15 minutes i was very optimistic i think as,0.04705796
the movie goes along it gets worse and worse for me by the end i,0.24144264
kept checking to see how long how much time was left and yeah which which,0.07620796
i don't like because i like this sort of older style of movie i like,0.15080167
the silliness and the fact that the movie can just exist to be a a,0.42877412
sort of vehicle for fun little one-liners and zings and zangs one of my biggest,0.13036354
problems with the movie though is that it really doesn't feel like a film rather,0.09898823
than a bunch of little skits sort of stitched together and i know that that's,0.41491446
probably indicative of the mark's style right like a lot of a lot of those,0.09219762
movies i'm assuming the plot just exists for one-liners and that's fine i don't mind,0.07170881
that at all but the plot here is very thin uh there is a love,0.07547802
story going on with with two two two of the characters that i was not,0.041293338
invested in at all and the this that's sort of the through line throughout the,0.037156116
movie is just that relationship that love story and it just wasn't enough to draw,0.08159709
me in um i'm going to contrast this movie with something with a movie that,0.14896584
i really like from the same era bringing up baby from 1938 i also just,0.17504406
watched this year for the first time and that movie does a much better job,0.05255617
in my opinion having a likable love story um having a plot that yes is,0.09754629
funny but and facilitates really good little scenes of humor but is also an interesting,0.07673096
plot and also just is a better through line even if that movie too kind,0.10439973
of loses it a little bit by the end not nearly as much as this,0.15290649
movie does i i am pretty easy to get on board i will i will,0.087010115
give most movies a thumbs up uh and i didn't hate this movie it was,0.104987726
easily watchable there were some movies that or there were some lines rather that i,0.059071887
just i was laugh out loud laughing at from groucho and i just wanted more,0.14505595
of that i wanted more of that zany snappy sort of dialogue that he's known,0.1519909
for and we got a couple of those there's there's a scene where he's alone,0.10876013
in a room at a table and and three other guys have just kind of,0.054995593
left to go hide in the closet as a cop comes and investigates uh the,0.22176719
room and the cops like oh i see you have a table set for four,0.15258677
and groucho goes oh that's nothing i have my alarm set for eight a little,0.10576595
stuff like that i absolutely love there's one of the two of the three sort,0.09649823
of stowaway characters one of which is the love story guy the other two are,0.06399418
chico and harpo are tucked away in his trunk in groucho's trunk he opens the,0.34000808
trunk to see two of them and he's like where are my other clothes and,0.34531435
they say they sold them or whatever and he's like well that's okay i keep,0.11596738
a shirt tucked away in this drawer and he opens the drawer and it's i,0.15050715
think it's harpo it's either chico or harpo he's asleep snoring and groucho goes well,0.2633904
that's not my shirt my shirt doesn't snore i love lines like that i love,0.11627529
little dialogue moments like that and i just wanted more of that from this movie,0.06845942
i think this movie is at its best when groucho is talking uh i don't,0.2399624
really love chico and harpo from this film their best scene to me is sort,0.101095155
of the instrumental back and forth so throughout the course of the movie there are,0.033232864
these song breaks that while i get is just like old hollywood right like a,0.18795957
lot of a lot of old movies are pseudo musicals even if they're not actual,0.1923843
musicals and i get it especially with a movie called a night of the opera,0.10421285
that you have to have some songs the songs suck i i will not find,0.88824683
myself singing any of these songs tomorrow they're they're just they're just not good and,0.2401398
maybe that's because they're an opera song from the 30s right like that is pretty,0.1028715
pretty uh far away pretty detached from what we're used to with music but even,0.10125457
like going back and watching other musicals from that era and stuff there are far,0.044937525
catchier songs than this sort of kind of style going on and it's just to,0.10849921
me it's not captivating to me that was when i was checking my phone and,0.07620309
not really paying attention to the movie i think that afi at least with my,0.13570565
experience so far i've seen about 25 of the movies of the top 100 um,0.055068556
a lot of which are from this sort of golden era i think we can,0.06127309
give those movies a little too much credit like yes i know that they are,0.097643234
trend setting yes i know without them we wouldn't have a lot of the sort,0.09108349
of snappy dialogue comedies later on um i just don't think this is the finest,0.10263077
example of that uh and i i'm looking forward to seeing duck soup which i,0.31089434
know i think is just groucho as opposed to the entire marx family i think,0.33889064
there could be too much marks in a movie so i'm looking forward to seeing,0.12005476
duck soup and seeing how that contrasts with this for me personally i was very,0.16069284
unimpressed with this movie really i liked the first half a lot more than the,0.068114296
second the second is really when they start hammering in the sort of the the,0.12017562
music and the more physical scenes oh i was gonna say so uh there's a,0.101115644
there's a scene where they're singing on a boat and then uh chico and harpo,0.12726149
kind of go back and forth on the piano and harp and it's a fun,0.20942914
scene um especially uh whichever one i think it's harpo the groucho is the easy,0.32635638
one because he has a mustache the other two i get confused uh harpo does,0.4038141
a really fun piano scene where he's sort of entertaining the kids on the ship,0.14839882
and like does a lot of little slapstick stuff like closes the lid of the,0.31089434
piano on his hand and then he pretends like his hand is limp and then,0.46530437
he can only get it when he rocks it back forward and then he goes,0.110398486
limp again like that's it's a really fun little little scene um that that scene,0.24176088
and a couple other scenes in this movie feel a little masturbatory from the marks,0.6644
like hey we can do this thing really well we can do piano really well,0.077300996
or we can play hard really well or whatever so we have to have that,0.06552252
scene in the movie like plot-wise it made no sense why this random these random,0.15316932
two stowaways or just having an instrument battle for 15 minutes um and i get,0.047595482
that it's like an iconic scene and stuff but at the same time why like,0.07964009
why does it why does it need to be in the movie ultimately i i,0.054201234
do enjoy films of this of this ilk um i i really do like sort,0.12872437
of old hollywood and i like groucho marx and i like some of the lines,0.31089434
in it some of the dialogue was really really funny at the same time as,0.04843298
a movie the plot is almost non-existent um and if the one-liners aren't there to,0.03901706
carry the plot then the movie falls apart and a lot of the movie just,0.060793474
isn't dialogue it's it's physical comedy that again i don't hate but it just doesn't,0.0965226
play super well 80 years removed from it right with that being said uh i'm,0.1497133
giving night at the opera two and a half stars to me three stars is,0.052707125
like an average good recommended movie uh a night the opera for me falls a,0.15461044
little bit short of that i just think it's okay and i think two and,0.22182463
a half stars is about okay um so i'm giving it two and a half,0.058833357
