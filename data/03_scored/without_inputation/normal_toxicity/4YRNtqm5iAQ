Caligari,0.030955054
this is a 1920 film from Robert wine an absolute classic kind of a horror fan rite of passage,0.14457628
because many many do credit this as being really the first film to be categorized as horror as something meant to to scare audiences and you know chill them to their core things like that,0.13050841
and it is a silent film 1920 a German film a German expressionist film,0.046727452
so with that you get a lot of the exaggerated set pieces and real kind of surreal nightmarish kind of look to it where it's it's not meant to kind of reflect reality but kind of I don't know reflect the mental state of the characters within this nightmarish kind of world so that works really well and you obviously I mean you can kind of look a little closer and see that there may be like cardboard cutouts said sort of paper things like that but 1921 when the camera like was stagnant you know not moving around it,0.123734765
you can kind of get away with that kind of visual trickery which I mean this film has to be the absolute best example of something like that of the German expressionist kind of kind of thing,0.31089434
well I had seen the movie a few times before this month,0.10623738
actually I had the opportunity to catch it on the big screen see it a theater with with a live score played for the filament and that was really cool and and really cool like it was almost a full house,0.052732904
so it was very nice to see that it looks like the the lure of the good doctor still still can bring in audiences to this day,0.06567765
and and still hopefully scare people so that is that was great basic part of the movie it is we have this sort of like the main character,0.14899366
Francis,0.030291568
he's he's recalling the story of meeting,0.061362255
this doctor and how basically the doctor Caligari he he travels from town to when they have fairs and in this this particular town is having their fair,0.05643579
their festival whatever you want to call it,0.11461718
and his attraction is some nebulous sleepwalker,0.3907925
I guess named Caesar the the tall spooky looking fella,0.21155483
that's that's the most memorable kind of visual of this movie,0.06414368
I guess you could argue and this scare probably the scariest thing about it,0.11435553
the attraction is he's forever asleep,0.18360317
I think he's been asleep for 23 years,0.13287617
but when he awakens him for the audience,0.068555474
he has the ability to see the past see the future read fortunes things like that and it certainly affects some of some people and and basically what starts happening is within this small town there are murders happening and we begin to suspect and of course the main character and the the police force they begin to suspect that it might have something to do with this dr.,0.09415335
Caligari and his sleepwalker,0.18946064
and it's about piecing that all together,0.08465668
there's a general plot of the movie it's I mean of course you know it's it's a very influential film where I mean like some obvious examples like David Bowie and and his Ziggy Stardust persona was very much inspired by the Caesar character even if you like watch Rob Zombie's video the living dead girl basically it's like almost like you know shot-for-shot cabinet of dr.,0.21311446
Caligari stuff like that and like a lot of modern movies really take examples from this and storytelling techniques from this movie to this day this 100 year old movie so I mean I like I'll probably be getting into spoilers here,0.0943882
so if you don't want this century-old movie spoiled for you,0.5236339
I mean short reviews this check it out definitely check it out,0.07291912
and if by any chance you do have an opportunity to catch a screening with a live score,0.14805947
see it with an audience absolutely take advantage of that it was a great experience,0.062115736
but I mean what it it has inspired a lot like within horror genre and thriller and things like that is the display of the mental state of madness,0.2757836
and how a story establishes that because really this this is kind of I mean first silent film from 1920,0.058784787
it's really ambitious plot wise and very layered plot wise and quite complex where we do have kind of like a a story within a story than a big twist and where with the the category character everyone's trying to figure it out Francis's best friend is killed by Caesar and he's trying to figure it out with the police they they track,0.1935132
it down to the mental institution where the director of this institution is the spitting image of this Caligari and we learned through his diary that he had become obsessed with supposedly the real Caligari,0.30453616
and he wanted so badly to learn the ways of some Nambu lism and using a sleepwalker to perform your will having control over them being their master and doing things that they normally wouldn't do that they would find a testable such as murderers as we see with with Caesar,0.34437662
and so he kind of steals his identity in a way but we wonder how can this really be,0.28005362
so I mean the the big twist of the movie is that the the character Francis the the man he's speaking to is is actually just another patient within the institution,0.07447758
and this whole thing has kind of been within his mind,0.106081694
but is it really or is it actually the the insidious work of dr.,0.09794919
Caligari because there is kind of there there's this final shot in that film before they they iris out where you know everyone within the story of the film appears in the end as patients where you think okay he's just used those as examples within his mind you play out this deranged fantasy of his and they take him away at the end and Caligari he's like ah yes,0.26699492
okay,0.050967902
i understanded lusion,0.0858865
now I can help him,0.05563566
but then he kind of like gives this little look - like suggest,0.10164349
that,0.03800065
maybe this is this has all been his doing is kind of like a supernatural twist to,0.0979357
it so there is kind of a blend of the supernatural and a blend of just the psychotic of this main,0.3483684
character,0.052153286
so we kind of we're left to wonder how much of each it is affecting,0.094076455
the overall story so that's pretty clear and like eaec like with any movie where it kind of like you know turns out in a twist that the person was was crazy all times,0.38702318
it was a delusion,0.15032679
the whole time I mean it's it's been done time and time again,0.05450179
and this movie had really kind of set the groundwork for that where you know in with these sets and kind of having the the surreal visual style to what we see the environment within where these characters are are living,0.03611078
you know the the skewed doors and the flooring,0.0927791
that's like kind of all centering into this character in a very specific kind of way is it's all really cool and and even kind of stuff like where we see when reading the diary the madness of the institutions director where he's seeing like,0.07576703
he's gone totally insane,0.55143416
he's seeing in in the sky on the trees on the doors become Caligari over and over again and kind of establishing that mental breakdown and like visual cues like that,0.15435286
so like all that kind of stuff,0.08929792
I mean you can kind of trace back to this movie so it is highly influential,0.13276328
but I mean at the same time it does work really,0.061912246
well you know on its own it,0.06493247
I think it still holds up well as a scary movie like even like,0.15228347
you know,0.07163658
it is kind of scary or spookier to see a movie like this where it is,0.104011
I don't know just because it is so old because it is silent because the image we see feels just a little ghost leer,0.08694032
I guess I don't know quite what it is,0.08319982
but there is something really really creepy about silent films,0.14016667
and and especially this one that you know it it does tell its story,0.05764519
so effectively visually right not just you know within some of the over-the-top stuff but you know obviously the the title cards which even like in the original German,0.1294612
they're they're very kind of over the top and and twisted themselves meanwhile like if you're an english-speaking audience member you just kind of see the little subtitle bottom which which isn't too much but still still very effective,0.34915468
in telling the story and a spooky scary story indeed it is,0.1101065
and the this version that I saw like I think some versions have like just plain black and white I guess but this one I saw it had kind of like the tints to it to you know set certain look at them,0.15363678
you know like that a light yellow tint or a light red tint and things like that,0.06925299
and this version must have been some guy list a semi recent restoration because the movie looks great it almost looks like a modern movie trying to look like an older movie like this which is pretty cool,0.0804761
and of course I you know I really enjoyed the the live musical accompaniment which is really good,0.084827796
it was the band is called the invincible Tsar's who they're an Austin band,0.074320644
and they traveled the US and Canada and they made their way up to my neck of the woods,0.10481576
and I was able to see that,0.060237937
so I mean I can't recommend strongly enough that if if they do happen to be playing in your town one of these one of these presentations absolutely take a look much,0.10175599
like Calgary himself kind of touring around and in bringing horror to the unsuspecting audiences and things like this a very influential film of course very hat film and kind of being the first in the horror genre and establishing all these kinds of psychosis and and supernatural and very visually scary,0.24129328
just certain images from the film just standalone are just so eerie looking and it's so well done absolute classic,0.069317974
I love the movie a rite of passage,0.15506217
I'd say for any kind of horror fame you want to kind of see where it all kind of started kind of the the first horror movie if you won't call it that,0.13626176
and that's that's at the cabinet of dr.,0.05751159
Caligari,0.030955054
so if you can't check out one of the the performances I'm sure you can find it pretty much,0.05951675
and I don't think it's I think it might be in the public domain but you can probably easily find it pretty much anywhere pretty pretty accessible,0.07210348
I would say so if you haven't seen it before if you don't mind the spoilers that I gave you definitely check it out well worth it well worth bringing to the table to your Halloween who are viewing if you're doing a a marathon,0.1541551
like I am this month,0.06013439
31 days of horror plenty more reviews to come stay tuned for those until next time stay scared and I'll see you later,0.12366786
