hello,0.054463096
everybody today,0.029480575
I'm going to be reviewing a moon light,0.06854621
this is written and directed by Barry Jenkins Jenkins actually based the film on a play that he had seen that was called in moonlight,0.07520479
black boys turned blue chickens was so struck by the play and also the playwright himself both of them had very similar backgrounds they both grew up in Miami and a lot of the situations really resonated with him,0.0052650967
and the result is this magnificent very sensory poetic work that I think depicts the minority experience it's so beautifully and so authentically,0.08981893
I really do think that this film has the kind of artistic presence that can resonate with anyone and everyone and I think it really does have a certain kind of raw power I walked into this movie knowing almost nothing about it really I all have seen it was a poster and just a brief premise,0.07803721
and I think the less you know about the film the better in terms of when you're just going in to watch it but I mean when I talk about the premise I'm sure you're probably going to roll your eyes because it does have a lot of what may seem like cliches and things that we've seen over and over and over again it is a coming-of-age story,0.1132012
it has that typical set up character set up and plot set up that does seem very much like Oscar bait or something of that nature,0.07303529
but it's presented in a way that is so unique to the filmmaker and in a way that I don't think we've ever seen before it's actually kind of similar to boyhood and Tree of Life in a lot of ways,0.08172086
maybe more similar to boyhood but it is in the sense that it is about a young boy going from childhood to adulthood,0.070663184
and this particular film it's told in three parts and honestly each part could stand on its own as some great kind of short film but when you add them all together that's when it really has a lot of gravitas,0.061061777
in this case the film is about an african-american male named Sharon,0.31089434
and he it's basically just about him trying to find himself him struggling with his identity his sexuality the persona that maybe he wants to wear for the rest of his life,0.31166455
and all of this is happening of course while life throws all kinds of different obstacles at him,0.24046524
Sharon is a very awkward very taciturn kind of boy always feeling like,0.25135258
he does fitting like he can't express himself and where you might think the film is starting to veer into cliche territory,0.13596888
it actually doesn't but it may seem like it because he does have a drug-addicted mother,0.49141508
he is taken under the wing of a drug dealer who becomes kind of his father figure,0.4433838
there is the school bully,0.41061535
so when you see all of that you may kind of have an eye roll or two,0.09630492
but this film even though it does employ those ideas,0.07513187
and those concepts that were used to it does it in a way that feels like it's very complex and like it all is serving the layers of the story the main ensemble of characters is very well defined,0.044231936
I think and all of this is done with very minimal dialogue but we're in cliches you might see the drug-addicted mother or the bully being kind of negative stereotypes and film in this case I feel that they offer that complexity because each time something happens to the character of shyrone it always models the waters,0.24408641
it's never good or bad,0.15746371
it's kind of a mix of the two because everything in life is messy,0.17507963
and I feel like in certain scenes of the film for sure the film is kind of saying that whatever beats you down whether it's figuratively or literally in this case it can good can come out of it,0.058280233
it can help you evolve and make you stronger and help you navigate life,0.1599461
maybe a little bit better,0.07813578
but at the same time when good things happen and good people come into your life sometimes that can lead to negativity that can lead to betrayal or it can hurt you in some sort of way,0.31089434
so there are pros and cons to everything where I make a connection with the Tree of Life is more in the visual style of it because I think they're similarly abstract especially at the beginning of the film in this movie you feel like through the the camerawork,0.06887879
it's like you along with shyuum are discovering the world the cinematography in the beginning feels very physical,0.15444313
it feels very disorienting,0.18586282
and you know there are parts of it that are kind of out of focus and that to me kind of reflects what it's like being a child you know that that vigor that confusion and that need for self-discovery,0.12172103
but as the film goes along it starts to kind of settle into itself a little bit more and become more kind of soft and subtle,0.06566956
and it's as if Sharon has finally learned how to deal with the world and how to make his way in a way that keeps him semi in control,0.10385624
he may not necessarily completely understand the world but you know who does but he's learned how to kind of defend himself and build these hard calluses and nothing in terms of the aesthetic of the film feels gimmicky,0.064600825
I mean when you look at the cinematography or the lighting all of it feels completely authentic and essential to the moment because it's not trying to reflect reality necessarily,0.052628253
but rather it's trying to capture emotion and the score is also amazing and I can't even remember the last time that I actually took note of a score,0.04691805
and mentioned it on a YouTube video because it's so rare in this day and age but it's very simple and very pure because it's you know for the most part it's it's kind of the main theme is a simple melody but I love the kind of wispy airy feel to the strings because it seems almost like in the beginning of the film at least,0.06980091
it,0.046851434
seems like a bird is kind of just starting to learn how to fly it's it's fluttering,0.12764175
its wings almost like,0.06523638
it's testing the waters and all of these different elements come together in what feels like this symphony of artistry basically in depicting an unlikely protagonist because first of all we rarely see an african-american at the forefront of the film,0.14648257
so that in itself is wonderful to see but it's also just the fact that he isn't used in a stereo to go away but what really resonated with me,0.14541693
and I think what's going to resonate with,0.0707169
most people is the way that you see this character evolution that his need for human connection and love vulnerability is so achingly present yet society slowly chips away at that that beauty that innocence that we have when were children until it's almost lost but it but it's not,0.15026955
it's always there like in Sharon's case in the case of,0.06341157
so many men,0.14858466
I mean when he's a young boy,0.28722885
he's taught to be this kind of masculine idealized man taught to walk it up not to show emotion and that's just not who he is,0.17372543
he's seen this week,0.062407553
because he wants to cry when everybody else says that that's not a good thing,0.21619773
and he also wants to express himself sexually in a lot of ways or at least he has sexual confliction for sure but in the society in which he lives he just doesn't know how to do that in part,0.52434814
one of the film there's a line by one of the characters where he tells shy room that you have basically I don't remember exactly what the line is but you have to decide for yourself who you want to be no one else can decide that for you,0.04965234
and that's a line that in movies and in life,0.086008914
you do hear a lot,0.13054474
but I think that the film itself is trying to say that no you don't just decide who you want to be we are so heavily influenced by our surroundings by the people in our world,0.08265543
we often become what we know whether we want to or not,0.06669051
and yet when we become adults we start to kind of find that truth than you think steer and we start to want to strip away,0.31460258
all of that kind of hardened those hardened calluses that we've built up as children because that's who we are inherently,0.24804457
and I think that's what shyrone tries to do especially in the third part of the film there's a quote by Roger Ebert that I know I've mentioned several times I I definitely overuse it,0.100493915
but I think that it fits this film so perfectly and I kept thinking about it,0.077219926
I was as I was watching the movie and he said something along the lines of art is the only way in which you can really truly understand what a stranger really feels,0.077058524
and I think that that just makes so much sense in the context of this film so even if you work on Wall Street and make six figures a year or something you can watch this movie and completely understand this young african-american man because you too have become a product of your society and yet also like shyrone we you have that need to be vulnerable and to be true to yourself despite all of those layers that you've built over the years every once in a while a movie comes around that really does move me in a way that I can't stop thinking about it,0.28852987
and I feel like in a way it just it really dug deep,0.08470309
and I it's much more than I feel most things,0.05418382
boyhood was one of those and Tree of Life was one of those,0.07081929
and this film did just that I think everybody has to see it,0.07388899
it is just a masterful creation and that is my review,0.10901095
