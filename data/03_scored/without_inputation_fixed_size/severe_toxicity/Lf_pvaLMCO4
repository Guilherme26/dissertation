out in 1934 which was only a few years into the sound era but before,0.031729925
the Hays Code era which enforced lots of censorship on films at the start of,0.03640284
this film we see call that Colver she plays a rich woman and she's on,0.12261729

to find the man that she wants to marry so then we see Clark april's,0.023592733
character come in so Clark Gable he plays a man who works for a newspaper,0.029935924
he's always looking for a good story and he comes across call that colder and,0.022066802
he then she realizes that she is on the blunt from her family in order,0.08056971
to marry this man that she wants to marry so Clark they have always thinking,0.11790646
okay I've got a great story here maybe I can make something of this so,0.025998702
this film really does so well is blend comedy with a romance well a rom-com,0.046737798
really obviously and this is one of the best well as opposed to one of,0.027876517
the best classic long comes from the era now I myself I'm not necessarily a,0.024730863
big fan of romantic comedies especially for this sort of era but I think this,0.059082277
is very good this film it's it's actually surprisingly funny I found myself chuckling a,0.055838842
few times I thought it was very funny and lots of bits I really like,0.1287097
Clark Gable in this film I've only seen Clark Gable in one other film gone,0.025568994
with the winds and he was very good in that but he's a lot funny,0.02812862
in this film he has lots of witty lines a lot the things he says,0.038987745
seem very well timed and it's just very funny and I really like a chemistry,0.03229666
between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert every scene they're in together is going to see,0.0501615
quite a lot the film they work off each other really well and the two,0.027619755
characters they're always trying to one-up each other in each scene so as I seen,0.035711713
a star where Clark Gable was trying to get a seat on my bus but,0.024947047
all that Colbert takes a seat first and then the bus driver says it's first-come,0.026576081
first-serve and then later on there's a scene where Claudette Colbert misses her bus so,0.03736137
then quite cables just sat there smiling and it's all these sorts of things which,0.036480002
work really well in making us like these characters and both these actors in these,0.034297533
roles they're both such likeable characters it's impossible not to like these two and it,0.06842944
just makes for a very light-hearted film though are a few darker little bits here,0.13530035
and there it's not happy all the way through but obviously the overall tone of,0.03162682
the film is very happy and very enjoyable now this film did very well at,0.01903955
the Oscars actually won the five big main Oscars which are Best Picture Best Director,0.0063152537
for Frank Capra Best Actor for Clark Gable Best Actress for pulled at holder and,0.02385149
Best Adapted Screenplay now there's only two other films or one those all those five,0.021506717
big main Oscars and that is one flow the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and then,0.05008367
the silence around in 1991 one of my favorite scenes in this film is when,0.049016718
Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on a coach together and then everybody on the coach,0.021225344
is singing along to the spans that is playing at the back of the bus,0.043327402
and is playing this song called the man with the flying trapeze and everyone on,0.04480544
the bus kind of joins in with the singing and they all sing different parts,0.06365608
of the verses and it's just a very enjoyable scenes it's a very like all,0.049104523
scenery set on the film really well another scene which is really clever actually is,0.022267023
a scene where Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert trying to hitchhike so staying at the,0.020533554
side of the road and Clark Gable he thinks is really clever he think he,0.04024627
knows all the different ways to get the cars attention by waving her arms in,0.042211223
a certain way or stick a knightly thumb in a certain way and all it's,0.06936468
get the driver's attention and he tries lots of different variants it tries about six,0.02221514
or seven times he throws every time so then call that Kolbert she comes up,0.051207166
and she just sticks her leg out and it says go up above the knee,0.19538306
and then the first driver stop straightaway that's a very funny scene another scene which,0.051775236
is really famous film actually when they're on the bus there's his character called Oscar,0.028349461
Shapley who is sitting next to cool debt Colbert's character and he's a character who,0.026013337
talked to really quickly and he's obviously very attracted to pull that whole box so,0.04318505
he gets so he's saying all these things that are trying pressor and he's just,0.040897485
a very funny quite annoying character and there's a few very funny scenes which is,0.07461498
in which stand out quite a lot and his character was actually part of the,0.012627182
inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny and it was actually a scene where Clark,0.029960537
Gable is leaning on a fence and is eating the carrot and that also was,0.036226567
actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny as well in terms,0.021526009
of what I don't like about this film I suppose the plot is a little,0.03824141
bit predictable especially the the way the film ends is quite standard really you almost,0.03743853
expect it to end a certain way well I did anyway from my point of,0.064103745
view I found ending a little bit predictable not that's a bad thing but there,0.053150833
are some other romance films particularly ones like Casablanca which end in a way that,0.032174267
you don't expect roses film ends in a way which I was expecting I could,0.04907991
almost see it going in this direction and I wasn't surprised by how the film,0.027751463
ended at all I was not to say that I didn't like how the film,0.052335985
ended I did like the way it ended but it just it wasn't that surprising,0.051966142
perhaps a little bit predictable but again that's not necessarily a bad thing so all,0.021281885
in all I have to say that it happened one night is a fantastic romantic,0.032761626
comedy I think most people should be able to enjoy this it's it's a fairly,0.042009007
easy film to watch these two characters quite a bond call that although they're both,0.029550118
such likeable characters in this film the on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic and overall it's,0.03763343
a very enjoyable film to watch so I'm going to give and one night a,0.06670262
rating of 8 out of 10 I don't think it's a fantastic bill but I,0.044654444
do think it's a very good classic romantic comedy and probably one of the best,0.07140613
romantic comedies from this sort of error that I've seen so there we go so,0.040739838
that is it happened one night so what do you guys think have you seen,0.026979849
