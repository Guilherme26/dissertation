city lights was released in 1931 and was written and directed by Charlie Chaplin it also stars him,0.033132598
this was a major passion project for him,0.0775951
and something that he worked on for many years,0.05481354
if you guys aren't familiar with Charlie Chaplin he was one of the biggest stars of the silent film era his character,0.07945265
the sometimes known as The Little or he would sometimes refer to him as little man,0.1361333
this is a character,0.06845734
that's synonymous with the silent era was one of the most famous at the time and one that Chaplin had portrayed in various films,0.06248962
and short films and Chaplin's choice to make city lights as a silent film despite the fact that Hollywood had begun to move towards,0.05800877
the talkies was a divisive one because people felt at the time that talkies were going to take over and of course they did but Chaplin was of the belief that silent films were really what filmmaking was all about in the talkies they would die out in a few years but I think his real motivation for making this a silent film was that he wasn't very comfortable with the idea of this character that he created existing in a talkie,0.24036156
he didn't think that the character would be as funny because it's a character that relies a lot on pantomime and expressions,0.055608492
it's very physical,0.08135154
lots of sight gags a lot of things that he does in this film are a bit like a dance,0.241676
so he was afraid that this character would not work in a talkie and he may have been right,0.12130198
and nevertheless we have city lights as a silent film,0.11018577
and I would say it's probably my favorite silent film this is a movie about Chaplin's famed character the who meets a blind woman who's selling flowers he quickly becomes infatuated with her and has to try to court her without her finding out that he isn't rich,0.1499676
and when the befriends someone who actually is rich a drunk man who's trying to commit suicide and he keeps him from doing that their roles switch quite often and he gets the opportunity to have access to things that only a wealthy man at the time would have like a car or money to buy flowers from her,0.42660463
and so now we have a moral dilemma,0.06787042
he loves this girl she likes him back,0.31089434
but she thinks that he's rich and he's really not city lights is one of my favorite romantic comedies if you were to call it that in many ways it has influenced,0.13030872
all romantic comedies that have come since then especially in its final scene I have seen countless films with a moment,0.073842384
so similar to the way this film ends that you can understand why,0.09083915
so many people credit Chaplin for showing Hollywood how to make films or how they can make films that are financially successful,0.0714916
while also being critically successful because this film was both of those things Albert Einstein came to the premiere and we still have a photo of that today,0.03733091
and so you can tell that Chaplin was definitely someone that people were paying attention to at the time,0.07405639
he was already famous by the time this movie came out but the idea of making a silent film once talkies had been introduced reminds me of how Alfred Hitchcock decided to make psycho black and white in 1960 even though colorized films were popular at the time he wanted to make a film that was black and white because he felt that that approach to filmmaking had more merit behind it had more suspense to it,0.033810023
he could get more things out of it than he could from a film that was shot in color,0.23985824
but what's inescapable about this film when you watch it today is just how damn funny it is from scene 1,0.6042052
I'm laughing my ass off there are,0.8606264
so many sequences that are so simple,0.09976488
the things that he's able to do with this character,0.08171662
a boxing match in particular this dance that everyone's doing highly choreographed and very well rehearsed,0.11577161
it's just so goddamn hilarious and that's Chaplin he was such a perfectionist a lot of people,0.7429191
when you think of a perfectionist filmmaker you instantly think of someone like Stanley Kubrick who was definitely a perfectionist Chaplin may have been even more,0.20633677
so history has shown us through various interviews with cast members of this film people involved in the production and documentaries about it that he would shoot sequences far more than other people would,0.23584679
he would do shot after shot take after take to try to achieve something that was in his head,0.67170167
he would sometimes jump into other actors roles and perform the sequence exactly how he wanted them to do it there was quite a bit of on set tension between him and star Virginia charile,0.15008941
because the way Chaplin worked he shot this film over the course of a couple years,0.19054507
and he was such a perfectionist about making everything as good as it could be that some of his actors,0.23101045
including Jarrell were getting antsy,0.101728484
and he actually fired her at one point reshot parts of the film with someone else before eventually rehiring her again this is not the type of filmmaking that could be done today Virginia charile today in 2018 would go on her Twitter and say Charlie Chaplin just fired me and it's horrible,0.24023739
and you know Charlie Chaplin would be faceless with so much pressure from social media and the news world to be a better person,0.08456199
perhaps,0.027401347
that's a good thing,0.060171902
but in the long run his incredible OCD perfectionist brain made one of the best films of all time,0.36243176
and so you have to wonder just at what point did Charlie Chaplin go overboard or did,0.0648136
he go overboard by firing people and rehiring people and then firing them and rehiring someone else did he go overboard or was he just trying to make a perfect movie in the way that he felt,0.42864904
he could it's interesting to view old Hollywood versus new Hollywood and I read about the production i watch interviews i watch documentaries and I realized that if this exact film was being made today it would be very controversial,0.08408583
in the way he handled himself on the set but it resulted in a great film and one that is timeless because nowadays there's a bit of apprehension when you sit down and watch even a black and white film kids today they don't want to watch movies that are old like that even some adults don't want to watch older films let alone a silent film one that is told entirely through pantomime music and some sound effects,0.03587906
this actually does have some sound effects,0.11207819
there's a hiccuping whistle scene,0.15228389
there's some sort of like almost like Charlie Brown talking in the background where some people are like a crowd in the beginning are chanting,0.19431129
and it's like it sounds like almost like a kazoo that was actually Charlie Chaplin making those sounds which makes it the first time Charlie Chaplin's actual voice was ever heard in a film they're going back to that apprehension that people have about watching a silent film,0.11966858
I think it's gonna be boring or that,0.15387361
it's not going to have any action sequences or anything to invest you in but from the beginning of this movie consistently,0.0800083
I'm laughing in particular the scenes with Harry Myers who plays the eccentric millionaire,0.13869292
this guy only recognizes the when he's drunk when he Sobers up in the morning he's like who are you get out of my house,0.42596164
it creates some really hilarious sequences one of the best moments in the whole movie is watch how you're driving him by driving,0.08063643
the guy is literally behind the wheel Chaplin and his cast have crafted a silent film that is drastically funny extremely well shot and still holds up today as a film that has clearly influenced tons afterwards his sight gags the slapstick his stunt work his actors are all fantastic,0.28010046
this film is a labor of love for sure if you ever read into the production and a lot of people argued and it was a long time coming for Chaplin,0.15056154
but the end result is a classic that has stood the test of time and if you've never seen city lights or if you've never seen a silent film before this might be a really good one to start I'm gonna give city lights and a plus guys,0.05315509
