hi I'm an angel and today I will be reviewing the 2018 thriller a quiet place this is John Krasinski's directorial debut you may know him as Jim Halpert from the office,0.093735486
that's how I know him,0.06581275
and I was really surprised directorial debut and we're going for a horror thriller really I was kind of hoping that his directorial debut would be threat level midnight,0.1516305
- but you know so a quiet place what did I think I want to see in the movies I don't usually see who are movies in the cinema because scary you know and if you're like me and you're pretty chicken and vulnerable I'm gonna say you may not like the movie going,0.32334772
experience so so much but it's a good movie not just horror movie good,0.15345515
movie it's a fun movie to go see in the cinema but be careful if you have a cough try not to call if you have popcorn or crunchy food or anything that crinkles and cracks you will be singled out I went with a bag of,0.1312307
popcorn I always sneak in my own,0.17927262
food,0.021807017
and I just realized in the cinema how noisy it was,0.13366997
so I ate like all of it during the previews just to make sure that I wouldn't make any noise during the movie it's not a completely silent movie but it is pretty quiet,0.1004122
so you do want to respect the movie-going experience maintain the ambiance of silence when it is demanded,0.15257266
plus if you get sucked into the movie which happens pretty easily,0.61327064
because the story is well schooled and well portrayed you're gonna hold your breath often and I had my coat over my face,0.31089434
there are jump scares,0.067551665
there are quite a few I thought some of them were kind of useless,0.5500729
I'm just gonna say raccoon,0.08467299
I think you know what I mean,0.11056843
if you saw the movie that was kind of annoying,0.35501
they kind of emphasized the jumps with sound and music and loud bangs and strings of hits whatever not necessary,0.22964092
I often talk about how these jump scares and horror movies are cheap movie tricks to get people to get scared,0.24314693
but your story should be scary enough or you can't have a jump scare,0.24104285
but it doesn't have to be,0.064177364
so emphasized with useless sounds that wouldn't be there in the real circumstance,0.4670473
you know what I mean for example I hate it in horror movies especially monster horror movies when there's a mom and it's making all this sound and somebody's hiding from it and all of a sudden it's really really quiet right,0.44354215
and then the person either turns around opens the door or does something and the monsters right there and they go back and there's like a huge sound but it's like weren't you just noisy,0.3290866
this whole time you were coming down the stairs like yeah like in the walking dead too you know it'll be like the monsters go when they walk they are not inconspicuous,0.5126294
and yet there be a moment where everybody's just in the woods in the silence of nature all pretty and all of a sudden they get in a psych,0.1958981
I really dislike it when movies do that,0.10700701
and luckily this movie doesn't do that the monster here,0.3054593
I think it's an alien is safe to say it's pretty freakin noisy all the time and they don't really have those moments of not noisiness which is weird because apparently they're really sensitive to noise and they don't like noises,0.37838492
yeah they are so noisy like what is wrong with you you're like a broken car or something,0.561389
if you see the trailer,0.07107811
you know what the story's about it sets it up pretty directly,0.054174304
you know it's post-apocalyptic monster ville few families survive must be quiet the monsters are sensitive to noise,0.3669802
so they will hear you,0.06512988
so you got to live in an ultra quiet world which is not how this earth this world is built babies come out the womb crying you know,0.4263804
so we're kind of made to make noise speaking of babies they integrated that into the movie of course,0.1801153
mama has a pregnancy and has to give birth in this world,0.3542051
now you could say birth alone pregnancy,0.13362242
that's enough to make a horror movie right it's pretty gruesome and painful and awful and there's a lot of screaming involved,0.38771427
so you don't need much more but add on top of that creepy monsters creeping on you looking to kill you maybe feast on your baby like a Big Mac horror thriller suspense and they did it well these kind of movies you don't usually get an exploration of the situation or in they'll just throw you into a post-apocalyptic world with certain characteristic people have to accommodate to a new style of life,0.68515146
but you don't get to explore that concept,0.096825674
you don't get to see what it would look like in a day to day of somebody living in this type of world,0.18814062
but here we do and I really appreciated that we get to see them live in a world without shoes first of all I'm out come on really no shoes like not even espadrilles or ballet slippers can be really stealthy a great idea is to pour sand all over the place,0.10236408
two five full sounds crunching of leaves when you walk on floor branches cracking whatever luckily for them this alien cannot see but in here's so they have lightbulbs and flashlights and triggering things clever,0.23974225
and in this kind of world the families that survive are obviously the families that learn sign language before all of this hits so huge advantage to having that skill in the back pocket,0.10385783
you got to know how to soundproof a room you got to know how are you gonna do when a baby comes because the babies cry and they thought of this and all that and it's what it was really interesting,0.15359412
I just appreciated that side of things the fleshing out of a concept and not just okay situation a horror movie run from monster,0.24063012
you know which we get all the time John Krasinski plays opposite his real-life wife II emily Blunt's and oh my gosh their chemistry is so real,0.16084032
so lived-in there's an intimate scene between the two that felt so natural and thick like thicker than Pam,0.09782707
and Jim you know and I never thought that I would ever say that because I live for pen and Jim but after seeing this I was like okay I forgive you Jim for not marrying Pam in real life,0.14283155
I get it you two so cute it's uh speaking of the cast,0.2675682
everybody did a fantastic job,0.09507414
the eldest daughter has a lot of complexity in her acting,0.1425479
her facial expressions are layered,0.35259727
I really appreciated it kids can easily come off as OneNote actors in movies,0.22244269
but in this case all kids really played their part,0.10250121
so yeah like I said this is a good movie a good thriller a good suspense good building and so much,0.1545101
so that when there are scenes with music I was tense,0.07198512
I was like should you be listening to an iPod right now like I don't know what if you miss something your ears are busy,0.31089434
and you don't hear the sound of a crate falling in the backyard,0.1680875
and now you gotta prepare because monsters are coming so they did a good job at making this world believable and immersive like there's the scene with a river,0.35606584
I got so tense,0.06998505
I was like I don't know about this,0.10799856
I was like the kid character in that scene,0.08664123
I don't know that there's that much more to say without spoiling it,0.11940422
so I'm going to transition into the spoiler segment,0.10780769
I'm just gonna wrap it up by saying if you like horror movies or thrillers more with suspense,0.3558141
no blood there's like almost no blood in this movie so really that's also a huge plus,0.16599314
if you like movies that really have a good story and science fictiony and that are well thought out science fiction stories,0.03326946
if you like monster movies or I would even say if you don't like monster movies I don't like monster movies I've mentioned this in another review I prefer a movie that leaves more to the imagination when it comes to scariness,0.356412
but this monster is actually scary-looking interesting to look at well-conceived,0.49080938
I would say obviously people have said that it looks like a demo Gorgon from stranger things which it really does but to me it also looks like an artichoke and I tried to eat one of those and it almost killed me so it's not,0.3650945
so far-fetched to have an artichoke as a monster they sharp I just recommend this movie go see with a bunch of friends in the cinema,0.3997024
so they can appease you when things get jumpy or watch it at home either way,0.10405131
I encourage people to go out and watch this movie it's a good movie and talk about an ending,0.15158077
well you want to get up and praise I wanted more though it ends a bit prematurely to me,0.11218626
it's like oh my gosh I want to keep going with this,0.24786505
maybe it could have continued into the credits but they ended it in a classy way you know you don't want to give people too much or too little but it would have been fun kind of like Dawn of the Dead,0.19993573
I think it is where the story kind of continues and the credits and you get a little bit of an alternate ending if you will oh yes finally I remember,0.16038622
and this movie gave me a huge I am Legend vibes,0.07307205
so if you also liked that kind of movie you'll enjoy this okay it's time to transition into these spoilers,0.15191197
so I'm just gonna say before you go like this video subscribe to music game news and thanks for watching whoo spoil alright,0.15088603
let's talk about this movie a place mmm the crazy dude in the woods,0.5154597
okay unpack this with me because I didn't really understand,0.09142322
and we had like a discussion with a group of people I went to see but still I didn't think it was very clear,0.07710329
here's my interpretation of it Jim and baby Ryan filleth I mean he really looks like Ryan Phillips Oh walking through the woods and they come across a dude and a dead woman and this dude kind of looks cray he looks like he's about to snap looks like it's about to scream and he does,0.40909973
and then blah blah blah you know what happens monster comes to claim that booty,0.54259163
I thought it was a murder-suicide,0.69542736
I think this person went crazy living in this world it'll play on a person psychology,0.5349884
it's almost inevitable,0.07337498
so he made sense for me to see this person as someone who snaps,0.37673247
and he took his wife's life or daughter,0.4224548
I think wife and then he was ready to take his own life because he couldn't live under the constant pressure or fear of not making it through tomorrow,0.24236813
someone else said that maybe the monster killed his wife and he came across her and then he just screamed out of the shock of it all the fear you know hitting him,0.6364068
I don't know she just wasn't disfigured enough,0.2402594
and we didn't linger enough on the body for us to really analyze the situation but she wasn't worn up enough to be like,0.121798314
oh yeah this was done by an alien,0.2793592
and not just a dude with a knife,0.3778377
but if you got a good look at her body,0.28308594
I just tried not to look cuz,0.08417513
I don't want to see her corpse did you,0.55948967
notice,0.035298906
maybe the way she was killed would give an indication as to how she met her end okay let's talk about the birth scene because that was intense for,0.29465306
so many reasons,0.10361708
first off someone had a group of people,0.16811053
I went to see the movie with said that the star of this movie is that nail on the stairs all you,0.15562545
can think about is that nail as Merson,0.0459866
at the end,0.065276995
when the daughter's about to come down the stairs,0.24202971
and she wasn't looking at mama,0.31089434
when mama said watch out for the nail,0.16943288
so you thought oh she's gonna trip on it too and scream yes,0.17108227
so that nails very clever touch but really does she have to like pull on that bag that was kind of a stretch you would think in a world where you have to be uber careful if you are carrying a load of laundry and it snags on something you're gonna stop you're gonna go down carefully you're going to carefully unhook it and be on your way not pull on it,0.20402606
and maybe dislodge something,0.051352084
I don't know I would think splinter not nail but even a splinter it's pretty darn painful,0.5306026
it was a stretch but fine movie magic right so momma punctures her foot,0.5154597
oh she had to swallow that because the demagogue ins was right there then she makes her way to the tub and the thing is coming up the stairs like it is right there we see it right,0.28254828
there meanwhile kid is going to explode them fireworks right,0.5228401
when Jim said go get the Rockets though I thought they were referring to the spaceship because that thing makes a lot of noise right,0.061096855
and I was like oh shoot the Sun is gonna go to find the rocket that the daughter brought to the burial site but he's not gonna find it,0.2758461
and that's gonna be a whole plot twist but it made more sense to go in the direction that they went in to have fireworks that the kid can light and run away from so that it gives him time to be away from the loudness,0.059294138
so yeah we're with Mama in the tub and she screams and then we see the fireworks explode,0.28820506
and I was a bit confused because they made it look like the explosion happened right after she screamed,0.15099724
now if I'm the monster and I'm hunting,0.24458149
I'm looking for food some people said that they don't eat their kill they just kill,0.76057655
it was written somewhere,0.076704115
I didn't see that written anywhere,0.07117921
so I'm thinking they're snacking I hear a scream,0.15279865
I am one foot,0.15378813
maybe from that scream from that snack,0.18979639
then I hear a bigger North in the distance,0.063646846
now I know that I got two snacks,0.06022562
it's an it logical for the monster to first address the first noise it has come across since it's like right,0.2698111
there even if it's not the snack on the minutes just to stop noises wouldn't it make more sense for them,0.08511387
the monster to be like you know what let me deal,0.43497792
with this mess first before I put out that fire so what they could have done instead was that she could have screamed and they could have played the fireworks audio at the exact same time and then cut to it so that we understand that her screaming was maybe muffled by the sound of the firework,0.16038929
but the firework wasn't so close to the house,0.11051611
though that it would drown out the sounds of a mother in you know what I mean you go with it,0.31089434
and that's another thing we see them in the pharmacy early on mama,0.14967158
you guys thought of everything,0.07699517
but you didn't think of grabbing them birth control pills you live near the pharmacy when we see them on day 89 it is you know they already kind of figured out how to live in this world or they're still figuring it out,0.18695337
and now we're at day 472 or something,0.085970946
so you've had time to consider that you're in this world,0.12299545
and maybe having a baby isn't a good idea,0.40321755
but maybe that was their executive decision we're gonna have a kid,0.056698855
we're gonna take the biggest risk of all time,0.08791752
what we're gonna create a soundproof studio in the basement,0.06969041
I don't know that a rickety old wooden house is the best place to hide but maybe that's all they had on hand,0.15230437
I don't know,0.1431935
it's probably their home,0.07855264
you know so it makes sense fine,0.08761065
oh my god that scene when she is sleeping and she wakes up to the sound of waters first of all you're like ah spa day,0.13111499
but no she's knee-deep in water and her baby's crib is afloat and the monsters in the corner,0.4609128
now when I saw that I was like oh oh my god,0.07694254
I was convinced that that monster just had a happy meal and that baby was snacked upon,0.45292026
Oh luckily oh that was not the case and she had to summon all of her courage to save that baby,0.18072765
and the way she sank it to that impromptu,0.31089434
waterfall reminded me of the way Homer Simpson sunk into those bushes can we talk about the baby dying at beginning,0.18446796
oh he was so cute adorable little kid that really shook everybody in the audience I mean if you watch the trailer you see it coming,0.15038408
though right,0.054813482
I didn't think that Jim could outrun that monster because that's what they do in movies right the human usually outrun something that you clearly see it cannot outrun,0.31089434
but here they kept it realistic,0.048944164
no there was no way it was gonna outrun that monster that baby was snatched and it was a good way to set the tone,0.45919734
I think very early on set the tone for the movie so now you know what the stakes are you know it was very clever right,0.112293676
and then later on oh my goodness,0.08994252
I actually shed a tear when Jim dies and then you're left thinking what if his wife didn't give him that speech about you got to protect him because what the hell are we doing here,0.5517007
if we can't at least protect our kids if she didn't tell him that maybe he would have been in that moment life,0.1072454
okay,0.050967906
let's see what we have a new one,0.059348114
we did lose that one,0.10406869
I could go and make sure that the new one is taken care of do I really want to do this right,0.07366971
now like I mean these kids are kind of annoying sue,0.53944874
maybe I should just let them all get in and continue in this world's,0.15273559
freest bird it would be a lot easier,0.100866154
yes I know could I live with it,0.032227147
and I kind of thought it would have been hilarious if he had let that monster eat his kids and he had to snuck away come back knowing that mama is watching them on the screen the whole time oh honey I'm so sorry,0.4444121
I I couldn't find the kids,0.10986586
so look in the morning okay we just go to bed,0.23920949
okay,0.050967902
knowing that that nail is there and not telling him but then that would have just been like a Tyler,0.17555445
Perry movie this movie even had kind of a Marvel feel right,0.20051333
with that earpiece that goes,0.07274265
berserk every time the monsters get close which that I didn't really understand does this monster itself emit some kind of a radio frequency or wave that interfered with the ear piece,0.3576836
every time I would get close to it because it didn't just mess up randomly it only messed up when the monsters were closed so clearly and had something to do with what they do when they open up their face their ear their artichoke lamp oh and when she turned it off in that truck oh the audience audible gasps it was just like no girl you are the superhero you are that's why I was so excited when we get to the end,0.24150074
and Mama is figuring it out,0.13106744
and you just want to scream it at her like piece it together girl,0.33355343
this is your scooby-doo moment figure it out,0.19111288
finally she gets it,0.07515033
and we get this badass ending pardon my language but badass gotta say it with momma and daughter click click okay baby,0.4731921
let's get in formation and they slay and that's why I was so disappointed that they ended it there,0.3669375
I wanted to see the slight edge and they could have put some Beyonce on,0.099231035
and just pull pull pull pop yeah yeah did I thought that it could have been okay to be fair that's Missy Elliott but that would have worked,0.042373005
so you know what I'm saying I'm better I'm better,0.06689921
I'm better get him get him get him and play that in the credits while they are just cleaning house just saying,0.13323787
so there probably won't be a sequel because it was a really nicely tightly made movie ended with a bow,0.0983309
it was about the quiet place,0.07898825
I don't know how they could continue unless they do a sequel with a new family somewhere,0.21306777
else in the u.s. also dealing with this in another original way,0.092273094
maybe we live in this very sequel,0.154114
eyes era where every movie needs a sequel and sometimes it's nice to just have a story have the end at the end of it and be beautiful and great as it is no sequel no screw-ups after just a beautiful crepe dash of cinnamon perfect,0.15476756
I really didn't expect to appreciate this movie as much as I did but I really did,0.063808136
and I would love to know what did you think of a quiet place let us all know,0.1239766
in the comment section below before,0.102168225
