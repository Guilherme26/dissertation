you know what child does movie just made me want to be a better person,0.11745937
a better granddaughter a better daughter,0.15204407
a better friend a better co-worker it just made me want to call all my loved ones,0.13956691
and I swear as soon as I left this theater,0.14253436
I called my grandmother tell her I love her hey everyone is sure under for paperweights,0.22434366
and today i want to be reviewing the farewell which is directed by lulu lane the film stars aquafina who portrays the character Billie as the centers around her family,0.038891748
I'm her Chinese family who finds out that her grandmother is ill does not have that much longer to live and so because due to tradition they cannot tell her what is wrong with her,0.24052046
so as an effort to get two families together,0.049566817
one last time,0.07550809
they just basically stage a fake wedding to get the family to come back into town to see ninety nine and to basically pay their respects without her knowing they're pairing their respects because she doesn't know that there's something wrong with her,0.14978455
and so one of the interesting facts about this film is actually based on Lulu Aang's life as this situation happened to her she found out that her grandmother was actually ill so in the beginning of the films that says that it is based on an actual lie,0.31089434
so for those of you who are new to my channel I tell you what I liked about the film what I didn't like about the film is should you pay your wait to see this film in theaters,0.08000587
so I actually had the pleasure of viewing this film earlier in the year at the Sundance Film Festival when I wanted to see it a second time mainly because I was dying of a viral infection when I saw this at Sundance but I would have to say that I really really enjoyed this movie this is definitely one of my top movies of 2019 and so going into what I liked about this film,0.060300533
I would have to say that aquafina who plays the character Billy she just such a fantastic job and really one of the first romantic roles that we've seen her and we know her more as this comedian this rapper that we've seen in crazy rich Asians we've seen as some of her YouTube channel stuff before she I'm started doing films and I think that she does such a great job also more so to the point where I want to see her in more dramatic roles,0.3421263
I think that she really brings you in on this journey she made me feel like it was my grandma because that's how sad,0.16685359
I was watching her but she finds a great way to balance kind of the drama the sad aspects of this film because it does deal with grief and it deals with how not only family does with grief,0.101547934
but what happens when you know that you're losing someone close to you,0.106829666
and you know the that time together you know it's very limited,0.08464265
and I thought that she did a very great job of conveying that on the screen and actually making you feel the same type,0.108474836
of emotions that she was feeling but also to do to the scripts they do a very great job of balancing such a heavy topic and balancing throwing some comedy in it whereas like we know there's a sad moment,0.117113695
but there's something funny that happens where it's just like okay,0.0763028
I can laugh,0.08626942
I can breathe I'm happy again,0.06700541
but I would have to say what are the other standouts of this film,0.15274853
and I want to make sure that I get her name correctly the Xu Xin xao who plays nine night Billy's grandmother she just such a great job on screen of you really understand why everyone is so sad,0.1693377
not just losing,0.07195278
you know a close family member like the potential that you could lose her but she just has such a great and warm spirit on screen,0.14480563
she's funny she's nurturing you just wait I want her to be my grandma not saying that I don't love you grandma because you're my favorite grandma in the whole wide world but she was great I was just like hey grandma I want you to be okay,0.21289109
like,0.02861636
I don't want you to go nowhere,0.31089434
but yeah like I had a really great time watching the farewell I think that I learned a lot about Chinese culture I didn't know that there was a thing where if you were sick with a certain type of disease that instead of telling you the family chooses not to tell them because they don't want fear to overcome and take them out early you know a lot of people when they hear hear that they're sick it does something to their mental state and they really give up before even beginning the fight,0.30390579
and so I felt as though that even though this movie is based on a Chinese family,0.14928551
I learned a lot about their culture but also too there were a lot of ways that I was able to relate to their situation as someone who I lost,0.07826654
one of my grandmother's a couple of years ago I've lost,0.16322169
my father I found a way to relate to them the situation very relatable if no one's gone through this I'm very happy that you haven't had to go through this yet but also to seeing the generational differences as we see how her father deals with this situation as her mom deals with this situation showing how people deal with grief in different ways,0.07743581
some people are very emotional,0.064315245
one of the reasons in the film they don't want some of the children to be around because they feel as though they can't hide their emotions,0.081488095
and even also to how we talk about those who find it hard to deal with grief and to show grief and to show emotion as dirt dilling you know with this sad circumstance but also to I did enjoy the aspect of showing how you know Western culture versus Chinese culture is so different because in America you know there's no way that you cannot,0.18512413
tell someone that they're sick or they're ill,0.49507573
on,0.040158812
vs.,0.03884335
as Billy's trying to understand her Chinese culture that this is a way of life,0.1860704
this is what everyone does as she kind of learns how to deal with the situation,0.11685366
but if I had to say anything bad about the film there are a few points in the film where the pacing is a little off that the movie starts to fill I'm a little bit long but it happens very few and far in between in the film but overall for me I had a great time watching The Farewell I cried I laughed I cried again and laughed again and it really felt like a therapeutic experience kind of watching someone deal with this grieving process I'm even resonating bringing up some of some of the different ways that I dealt with grief over the years of my life but yeah what I would tell you guys to do with you,0.058784965
and Gert coins for the farewell,0.083112486
I would tell you to pay this Cephas film in theaters aquafina blows it out of the park a little um a little own way,0.17243169
I can't wait to see what she does next,0.14205977
I think she's actually working on a sci-fi project NYX but I had a very great time with a farewell,0.09343793
I would recommend this movie to everyone to go see it right now in theaters,0.087798305
but those are my thoughts on the farewell as always my name is sure honor from Pierre awaits,0.099305324
