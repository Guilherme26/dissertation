this is a star-studded cast for knives out I'm actually I get very apprehensive of,0.24776208
films that just have so many talented actors in it sounds like girl like how,0.15396143
do you get like how does it make you feel it easy but because there's,0.061717767
so many actors in the film sometimes I feel as though that some people get,0.03708924
lost in the wayside you don't really get to focus on everyone so it's not,0.07650393
always an enjoyable experience for films like this for me but I have to say,0.15166104
I was pleasantly surprised I was proved wrong everyone in this film is so talented,0.09745427
they're so captivating what you want when you watch them on screen and literally as,0.11390448
each character is introduced they all still the show I think that they do a,0.032468174
very great job of balancing screen time for all the characters of course some are,0.032710616
going to get more than others but I think that everyone was very memorable even,0.06377033
after walking out of the film so I haven't talked about who my favorites were,0.07011778
first and foremost Daniel Craig who is this Detective this famous detective who has higher,0.26289552
deceptive Blanc he is absolutely hilarious he is this over-the-top investigator who have like this,0.30833763
strong southern accent and it's almost feels as though that he's making fun of his,0.06879565
character at the same time but it's not too over the top where it starts,0.061441746
to become like borderline on parody I think everything is balanced and done just right,0.071496174
and he was so hilarious to watch I can watch a whole series just based,0.08182754
off of his character them coming up with different murder mysteries I'm totally here for,0.2999622
their franchise since we want to turn everything else to a French shock that we,0.100211374
didn't ask for this is what I'm actually asking for and I think that everyone,0.081023425
will be on board with me as well also to Toni Collette who plays um,0.09636815
she's married into the family she's the daughter in law she is so fun to,0.12623239
watch I just need Toni Collette to be in every movie I think I would,0.08324305
totally be fine with that her accent her demeanor of this character she is so,0.154066
fun to watch I just loved her so much but I have to say I,0.11071672
was pleasantly surprised by Chris Evans not that I didn't know that he was going,0.0951976
to do a good job but he plays ransom who is really this just just,0.056132365
evil and greedy freeloading son of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Josh's characters I was,0.53779227
just like Chris like I like the sight of you now like we've never seen,0.1547716
Chris Evans play a bad guy before but I have to say I was really,0.26259744
entertained by his character the language that he had in the film is so nice,0.054934066
to see him kind of brushing off rendering these different characters that kind of get,0.10776017
out of his like nice guy persona I can't wait to see how much more,0.18461624
we see from kids Chris Evans within that couple of titles that he's working on,0.079990424
but I will have to say our lead of the entire film Ana de Armas,0.17140374
who plays Marta who was the caregiver for mr. army before his untimely death I,0.20895074
loved her character and I really think that they did a very great job with,0.06048422
the marketing for this film only with the trailer you really don't get to see,0.087386325
how much she has to do with the film is one of the characters that,0.03339998
you would think that will basically be overlooked but I love how she does such,0.110340886
a great job of captivating your attention of carrying this film with this star said,0.112685435
it cast she was absolutely a great standout for me and I loved what they,0.09420815
did with her character and I'm not gonna give anything away but I think that,0.085845664
she will enjoy it as well but I would have to say the star of,0.1046262
this film has to go to Ryan Jackson by white he's not in the film,0.5154597
his writing for knives out this movie is so funny I did not expect this,0.22108771
movie to be as funny as it was I was literally laughing from beginning to,0.07476374
the end of the film the entire theater was in tears from laughing and I,0.104075894
will have to say is done too it's because of the great script that he,0.06658092

the different family members he does such a fantastic job with this screenplay it's just,0.07072872

it there is like not one person who doesn't get a jab at one another,0.18621331
I just thought it's so brilliantly done the the comedy is so cleverly written also,0.1587516

dialog with some of the characters some of the things that they say I guess,0.039639547
if you're kind of thinking of those type of films those type of even novelist,0.27409485
that you've read like it would definitely hit you and then even some of the,0.31089434
easter-egg some of the things that are happening in the background I think that he,0.15186198

films that we may have seen maybe TV shows I don't want to give too,0.09013334
much away but I just thought it was so well done how he just so,0.11849058
