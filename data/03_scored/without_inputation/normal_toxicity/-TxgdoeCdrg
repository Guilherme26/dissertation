how are you,0.07340407
so before we dive into the review I first want to say this,0.08517643
Thank You Pixar I was so tired of those talking cars,0.144699
and Larry the Cable Guy as a tow truck,0.1092308

let's talk about Disney Pixar's inside out,0.15301628
so what is this movie all about it features a young girl named Riley,0.16900243
and we get an inside look into her mind at the characters of anger disgust sadness and fear who make up her emotions,0.18358184
by the way on a quick side note,0.06419232
if my anger emotion actually had to become a real person like a character,0.17577793
I think it would be a mix of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho JK Simmons from whiplash,0.31089434
and this guy right here Lois bloom from Nightcrawler steady hands now going into the movie inside out,0.1359438
I didn't know much about this movie I knew it was about emotions,0.09719925
as directed by the same guy who directed up and monsters inc and that's all I knew and that's all I needed to know plus she slapped Pixar on there,0.47526023
I'm probably gonna go see that animated movie unless you have Pixar then you have a whole bunch of cars underneath that I'm not gonna go see that movie one of the biggest themes in this movie is growing up and letting go and that's sometimes tough to do,0.07195713
I mean look at me look what I'm doing right,0.15439615
now I'm 28 years old,0.058868963
I'm sitting in a room I call the foot cave,0.15467505
I have a whole bunch of movies over there,0.060621057
I have oversized Star Wars toys,0.12015213
I say it's pretty safe to say I haven't quite let go of my childhood yet but you know what I at least,0.12412357
I don't play our dinger turtles in the bathtub anymore yes I do,0.09624498
now I could dive deeper into the plot of this film,0.16258784
but you know what I don't think it's necessary just know this,0.097557954
there's more to this movie than the trailers are letting you know and that's always a good thing and my biggest fear before watching this movie was that it was going to be somewhat repetitive,0.06671873
you have this young girl she's angry she's sad it's like okay,0.338142
I get it by the hour and a half mark of the movie but you know what I was very surprised at the way that they structured this movie I mean yeah you do get those things,0.08808968
but it's a very layered movie there's almost two different universes,0.07286345
and both of them are just as enjoyable as one another this movie also has a lot of comedy,0.25734168
it's a Pixar movie you will laugh,0.28293902
but the most important thing that this movie has is an impactful drama element,0.14645946
that's kind of intertwined with nostalgia,0.075013585
and what I'm talking about is this movie will give you those feels,0.09234398
yeah I almost teared up in the theater,0.06616529
well you know what I looked around before,0.08590805
I did it,0.05707056
and said I'm still a man everybody,0.08638643
and if a tear did trickle down my cheek I would have said I get some sour patch dust in my eyeball,0.5154597
I actually had to do that one time but let's talk more about that nostalgic vibe that this movie gives you,0.09494556
this is one of those movies and I love movies like this that make you think about your entire life,0.28512767
and if you're a little bit older you're an adult I'm 28 years old this movie really takes you back to your childhood memories,0.41631088
it makes you remember things,0.054324068
and when a movie about emotions can make you feel emotions,0.08505067
well I'd say that movie did its job I really like the nostalgic vibes that this movie is throwing out,0.10371949
I like movies that make you think about your own life,0.52036226
and I'd say that's probably the most beneficial thing that this movie has going for it if you're a little bit older and you go see the movie it will make you feel emotions,0.29538903
and if you're a younger kid and you go see the movie you're gonna be entertained,0.31299612
it's funny,0.08608005
it's energetic the visuals look great,0.084474385
so yeah there's something for everybody in this movie now let's talk about some of the other main characters in the film Riley's emotions you have anger you have a sadness,0.09581832
you have disgust you have fear and you have joy,0.58276093
and these are essentially the characters or emotions that make Riley do everything that she does in the movie and throughout,0.05072267
this movie you get a lot of comical bits between these characters is doing random things,0.19010851
at first I really hated the character of sadness,0.17117912
okay just one of the elbow would draw up on top of her but you know what after thinking about it,0.15239286
I was like she's sadness you're not supposed to like sadness,0.12351037
it's depressing,0.17249395
you hate it,0.51178527
so in that regard sadness as a character did her job,0.09741581
so here are my final flicking thoughts on the movie inside out overall this movie has way more going for it than I expected it to it's deeper than I thought it would be and actually had emotions and feelings and things actually went into my heart pulled on it,0.08438866
and said John we want you to cry,0.3194689
and I said not today and you know what I'll be honest with you if I watch this movie all alone I probably would cry just a little bit,0.24006882
I would get a little bit of watery eye it does remind you of certain things that happen in your childhood and it also has a lot of other little tidbits that I think a lot of people all deal with,0.20870347
but no one talks about for example you know when you watch like a bubble gum commercial,0.13163167
and that theme song gets stuck in your head all day long or you remember ten years later this movie deals with things like that,0.2679608
I'm going to give the movie inside out,0.16971798
that's my joy face,0.09320792
now there's my angry face uppercut,0.22194755
and a this is a solid movie that does its job a movie about emotions that makes you feel emotions okay guys,0.07244437
