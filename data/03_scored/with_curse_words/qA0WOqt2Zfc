hello welcome to R&B reviews I'm rob and a few months ago I actually back,0.059922516
in April I was i decided i was going to attempt to watch and review,0.04585865
every single film that was made by the classic comedy team the marx brothers who,0.104712255
starred in popular state shows in the 1920s and made a series of films in,0.06135023
the 1930s right up till the mid early 40's their first film was the coconut,0.047422733
which was made in 1929 and their last film was love happy which was made,0.06345288
in 1949 i managed to get through their first five films and i had to,0.08402704
take a break for a while because I some things came into my life where,0.16433482
I couldn't I just didn't have the time but now I think I can go,0.055872735
back to what I set out to do and try and review every single one,0.12091931
of their films and today I'm going to be reviewing a Night at the Opera,0.119067155
which is arguably their best film that was made in 1935 and it was originally,0.058623888
released by MGM and the plot is Groucho Marx plays business manager Otis be driftwood,0.114129975
who convinces his client mrs. Claypool played by Margaret Dumont to invest in the New,0.09095635
York opera company and Chico and Harpo Marx play comment who tries to convince Groucho,0.09812228
to consider their friend Alan Jones for the Opera Company while they're looking at other,0.037109703
people and arrange for you to unless you hundred thousand dollars in the New York,0.097622484
opera company I go to defense don't you see you'll be a patron of the,0.1531611
aircraft you'll get into society and you can marry me take you on a society,0.23972276
and all you've lost is to run about you know this smarts the first time,0.2794724
that the brothers made a movie at MGM after leaving paramount pictures as well as,0.064512126
their brother Zeppo behind behind and if you look at the early paramount films and,0.16240153
these later MGM ones you kind of do notice a bit of a difference for,0.12422423
one the brows were definitely much more family-friendly they became characters that the audience could,0.03129778
root for instead of people running around archaically poking fun at everyone now they only,0.2619688
poked fun at the films of these films and they were definitely much more alike,0.15238237
do you understand you're fired hey a big bully wants the idea of hitting that,0.5876557
little boys well you kinda let me handle my own affairs Cal now what do,0.15251827
you got to say to me justice can you sleep on your stomach with such,0.48604837
big buttons on your pajamas boy you many people have felt like this was kind,0.5154597
of out of character for Groucho Marx because Groucho poked fun at everybody but I,0.14753874
mean if you look at some movies like animal crackers and coconuts sometimes you would,0.27534482
go out of his way to help the leading man into romantic couples subplot even,0.18421939
though sometimes they could be a bit annoying but for some people that this was,0.18011296
a bit too much of a change to have him do that also another thing,0.10930421
you'll notice this groucho's lines are not all double entendres because of the new film,0.31089434
morals code that had came around where you couldn't talk about sex or drugs and,0.53490317
some stuff like that in the movies they could be clean wholesome fun which is,0.07436621
what kind of did Mae West in when she was making her films although watching,0.18846123
this movie I noticed that a few of these double attendre jokes kind of slipped,0.24116264
through the full sensor circuit I think we've got to keep everything on a business,0.09340561
faces how do you like that every time I get romantic with you want to,0.17031355
talk business I don't know there's something about me that brings out the business and,0.07872534
every woman also another thing you'll notice is romantic couples were more prominent granted the,0.11299426
romantic couple these young romantic subplot of these couples was prompt was always in Marx,0.10473257
Brothers movie since the coconuts but now they definitely are a little bit more forward,0.15189107
the reason was become this MGM didn't think Camille they're comedians could carry a film,0.11855866
on their own although duck soup and horse feathers that they made at Paramount showed,0.26415932
that they could NGM believe that the audience is wanted a variety of entertainment so,0.029924097
in these comedy musicals you've got comedy scenes musical numbers and you have the young,0.16073197
romantic couples to let the audience take a breath from their laughters in this film,0.12392634
of the couple is played by Alan Johnson kitty Carlisle they're definitely the more tolerable,0.059444524
ones in these energy m films and of course the formula changed Paramount's films like,0.09580975
I've been saying we're just most of them are just a bunch of gags strong,0.32453805
on a very thin storyline but here there is plot you get scenes where you,0.09837964
feel sorry for the marx's like there's a scene which I always remembers when grouches,0.30279884
getting kicked out of the Opera Company rather roughly in this movie and many people,0.15533927
find it depressing but that was the MGM formula if you look at the film's,0.105979905
and Jim films of Buster Keaton and red skeleton as well as the two films,0.10316071
Laurel and Hardy made over there warns of nothing but trouble they followed the formula,0.10053123
like one example in the character when the Communists are down and they decide that,0.14859672
there's nothing to do and they decide to step on up and mess with the,0.09405397
people who mess with them kind of like the Bugs Bunny cartoons where somebody messes,0.28104532
with puts money in bud spaces This Means War course you know This Means War,0.15403438
and he goes in and screw things up just to get back at them under,0.35260203
another thing you'll notice is Night at the Opera is a much more polished film,0.10574044
than the rough paramount films the what happened was the brothers went on tour to,0.06255935
try out these comedy scenes and the writers polished them love based on audiences reactions,0.17811154
which is why one of the reasons why I think coconuts and animal crackers worked,0.15262546
very well because they're dummies company seems so very well when they were doing the,0.612898
show wife and also not at the Opera contains some of their best comedy hits,0.16737226
including the famous contracts in between Groucho and Chico the state room scene where the,0.057032
groucho is living in a little stateroom on a ship and people keep coming in,0.27433184
and out and there's also a very honorary underrated one with with the brothers eating,0.08232473
breakfast together at the whole tire agreement is automatically notified well I don't know it's,0.047990803
all right that that's an every contract that's that's what they call the sanity clause,0.081912436
you can't follow me there ain't no sanity glorious also the comedy in the night,0.18916616
the Opera is much more deliberately paced and it's not so rapid as it happened,0.08584635
before Chico gets to do a very verbal comedy bit like the ones Groucho used,0.23758419
to do and Alan Jones is definitely more likable as the leading in and some,0.040446054
of the later ones friends talk fast I see a man in the crowd with,0.111089736
a rope how we happen to come to America is a great story but I,0.16270776
don't tell that so now I tell you how we fly to America the first,0.10571701
time I we started we get a half way of course when we run outta,0.10648208
gasoline and we got to go back then I take a place in watching gasoline,0.1879246
this time we were just about the land may be creepy when what do you,0.237236
think we're another gasoline again and the fact that we're going in to get the,0.052182604
mortgage that I didn't kick one of the things I didn't care for about 90,0.1457452
operas Margaret Dumont character to me just wasn't as memorable as mrs. Rittenhouse from animal,0.24942161
crackers or mrs. Teasdale from duck soup I think the reason is because here she,0.24303639
seems more annoyed at Groucho and just doesn't fine as attracted as they as she,0.19171351
had in those previous films another big problem that i have with some of these,0.14101034
later MGM films the Marx Brothers dudes is sometimes you have to fast-forward through the,0.08739256
musical numbers or the romantic subplots well if you watch something like horse feathers or,0.14727588
duck soup you don't have to fast-forward through anything it can just sit back relax,0.15397504
from beginning to end but regardless not if the opera is a I think despite,0.0783305
that the movie is very funny me it was never as good as duck super,0.24141234
animal crackers but they definitely the brothers definitely put on great great performances the bits,0.24604325
the comedy bits are again one of their best-known routines and I think they do,0.12757958
adapt to the changes very well I mean Groucho Marx said that this was one,0.0673126
of his favorite films that they had made a Night at the Opera is again,0.066003375
many people sue it as the start of the decline of their pictures but overall,0.10438749
it's definitely funny you may have to fast-forward through some stuff and obviously if you,0.113702424
don't like opera music you're going to probably fest go through some of the Opera,0.15242946
bits but I mean there's not too many of them in the movie but it's,0.15431686
a funny movie the brothers deliver despite some changes so if you're new to the,0.11330909
Marx Brothers this might be one you'd be willing to check out there's always been,0.069855675
debates about what type of Marx Brothers films that they like you like the early,0.11967377
roughhouse archaic ones they made it paramount or these later ones where they were more,0.087910354
likeable and you could root for them you know why don't you be if you,0.27616736
