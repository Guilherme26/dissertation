now it's time to move on to more important stuff farewell is a movie that,0.019656843
is directed by Lulu Wang or Lulu Wong I think it's Lulu Wang it stars,0.030561198
aquafina and Zima Azim I still know him as Chang from 24th rat-bastard the concept,0.47488117
behind the story is kind of interesting aquafina stars as a young woman who's been,0.036940973
living in america for a while now she and her parents actually had been living,0.06249733
in America for over 20 years they she gets the very bad news that her,0.0882712
grandmother the matriarch of the family is dying and she's not going to be around,0.2439664
anymore she's suffering from some kind of cancer or something she also finds out that,0.14414065
the rest of her family has decided not to tell the grandmother that she's dying,0.22995982
they all know that she's dying she doesn't know that she's dying and no one,0.23630446
else in the family is going to tell her kind of wedding that's planned in,0.036776673
China and this is really just an excuse to get the family together so that,0.024179425
they could say goodbye basically to the grandmother again does not know that she is,0.02877385
dying but everyone else knows that she is and they have to try to keep,0.09999706
this from her and this becomes a bigger moral issue for everyone in the family,0.047780808
the longer the film goes on I like movies where I can go into a,0.02578784
movie and there's a sense of discovery with it because I discovered some things while,0.03224611
watching this movie mostly that I'm an ignorant American who doesn't understand how other cultures,0.34050325
work I appreciate films that show me that other side of the culture that I'm,0.05236658
missing that show me how other people do things and how that's different from the,0.04583049
way Americans think and the way that Americans do things on something the premise of,0.07279437
this movie it just seems weird to American ears I saw the movie and I'm,0.106132045
like okay I don't get why they're not telling this woman that she's sick like,0.40431148
wouldn't it make better sense to tell this woman so that you can prepare for,0.12861924
us that everybody can build it up everybody can say goodbye and she can feel,0.019169927
like she you know she got a chance to say goodbye this movie showed me,0.028643472
a different side a different angle to that question it actually did present this as,0.014917408
an actual moral dilemma in the movie not just for Aquafina character but for the,0.013546465
rest of the family in between those complicated family dynamics and the moral issue of,0.023551492
telling somebody whether or not they're going Dyanne whether that's going to affect the experience,0.016256424
of spending your last moments with them it's really the emotional hook that got itself,0.075905435
into me and kept me watching this movie because I gotta say this is one,0.09111087
of my favorite film experiences of the year and it's a film experience I did,0.014461758
not expect going in as an American we're used to saying goodbye we're used to,0.02544261
it being a very emotional drawn-out thing but this movie also does a very good,0.04115092
job at pointing out some differences between the culture of America and the West and,0.08289452
the culture of you know the east and some of the countries and places out,0.06405253
there America it's all about you it's all about doing what's best for you and,0.047181476
doing what's best for yourself it's all about individualism and it's all about expression it's,0.027751463
all about being an individual there are the ease they have a different mentality everything,0.06294433
that they do is it's like one person is a part of a bigger whole,0.059169415
it's basically they're all for their family and all for society look at themselves as,0.06723144
part of a cog in the system just fascinating to get inside that system and,0.0128214145
see how their minds work look at the way that some people look at it,0.024949709
from the eastern side of things they're kind of like well actually you were part,0.025956132
of a whole we're supposed to carry that grief for them so that they don't,0.022376113
have to so that's why we decided not to tell them about like the fact,0.02070517
that this movie reflected this is a very balanced issue because honestly it's an issue,0.04957015
that has a lot of Merit to both sides say this is one of the,0.01587727
most compelling watches of the years it's not just about this film and the themes,0.028308885
and the ideas that it's dealing with but also the emotion and the family at,0.011914104
its core it's a movie that could have been about so many things in fact,0.03392636
in a lot of ways it is about a lot of things but it kept,0.019859057
its focus on the things that mattered the shoutout Aquafina aquafina was sensational in this,0.041020546
movie normally when I see Aquafina in a movie I'm like okay he's just there,0.05390848
to be the funny person she's just there to carry the comic relief portion know,0.047220055
in this movie she wasn't just the funny person like her character had a lot,0.06974517
of depth to her character had a lot of range and as an actress she,0.014481713
displayed that range in full display for everybody to see performance like this definitely makes,0.015854653
me more interested to see Aquafina and more serious dramatic roles because she definitely proved,0.04561763
in this movie she can pull it off all the performances in the movie feel,0.02950156
very real all of the writing for these characters feels very authentic the film that,0.016836463
also has gorgeous lighting and cinematography I don't know if it was shot on location,0.10341544
but I like the fact that they made everything look really beautiful in this movie,0.035802845
especially when they were in China whether or not to tell somebody whether they're dying,0.16025072
and what that will do for you and what that will do for them how,0.0258956
the characters in this movie don't know how to react around this woman because they,0.11331071
know that she's gonna die now there's an undercurrent of tension and emotion woven into,0.3239542
every scene because every character that's in a scene with her feels like this is,0.043091927
one of their final scenes one of their final times they're ever going to get,0.017946655
to spend with really appreciated the direction and the approach by the director I really,0.009238736
appreciated the execution of the performances the musical score the cinematography mostly I appreciate that,0.06567558
they took a concept like this and they made it something that I can understand,0.037273567
something that I can dissect from multiple perspectives and I like movies that give me,0.037183765
that sense of discovery give me that sense of perspective that I didn't have before,0.020866811
really have minor nitpicks with the film I do think that it got off to,0.03126097
kind of a slow start like in the first 20 minutes it took me a,0.07061922
little bit to get invested in things do you think later on in the film,0.034791764
there are some scenes that dry going a little bit unnecessarily there is a wedding,0.03830726
scene that takes place somewhere close to the third act of this movie just went,0.02971708
on for a little bit too long it felt a little bit self-indulgent I'm gonna,0.25306445
say farewell to the farewell and I'm gonna put it where it belongs on this,0.034311503
