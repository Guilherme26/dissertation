black clansmen was directed by Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Ron Stallworth,0.0017555365
and this is the outrageous true story about a police officer from Colorado played by,0.022459261
John David Washington who decides to infiltrate the KKK and he does so by talking,0.07229283
to them on the phone but one of his fellow officers portrayed by Adam driver,0.030243905
goes to them in person and acts as his surrogate while Ron talks to them,0.123406865
on the phone and gets inside their heads and so they're working undercover to try,0.07770875
to figure out what they can learn about the KKK in the 1970s and this,0.055577423
is a completely insane based on a true story movie and I think Spike Lee's,0.08694083
best film since Inside Man I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end I,0.022072788
thought it was riveting but most surprisingly very funny I really didn't expect that going,0.01711052
in because I tried to stay away from the trailers I've been trying to do,0.026450362
that lately where I I don't see too many of the trailers or or know,0.029090477
much about the film going in and I found that I enjoy films or at,0.031234363
least am surprised by films a lot more in doing that so I was really,0.027945695
taken aback by how hilarious this film actually is and how often I was laughing,0.053768124
a lot of it is due to the interplay between John David Washington and Adam,0.014504994
driver then going back and forth trying to figure out how they're going to play,0.021872569
each other one of them's on the phone the others in person this is just,0.034916155
such a great idea and it's actually surprising the film hasn't been made up until,0.018341774
now because not only is it a very relevant movie for today's times it's just,0.025700035
such a great story and for this film Spike Lee has taken a considerably more,0.038714353
mainstream approach and I think that was a very wise decision because this film needs,0.018766826
to be seen by as many people as possible and to do so you kind,0.048921596
of have to adopt more of a crowd-pleasing element to your film even though the,0.03455895
story is very dark and in so doing I feel like a lot more people,0.030632373
are going to see this movie and a lot more people are going to hear,0.04085425
the message and understand its importance there are some historical inaccuracies throughout the film and,0.020657279
some things have been more embellished to create more of a theatrical experience and I'm,0.03518888
assuming that more than likely some people will find fault with that and thus say,0.014999892
this is a bad film or be angry about that but I've never really seen,0.054290295
a based on a true story movie that doesn't in some way embellish things or,0.017872155
try to make things more entertaining for an audience and that's what this film does,0.024900485
a few times and it didn't bother me I I never thought that it encroached,0.025435958
upon his message I never thought that it took away from the film I was,0.026503578
constantly invested and I had a great time watching it John David Washington I want,0.030541908
to see more with him there are many times throughout his performance especially when he,0.016186578
raises his voice where I was like wow you sound just like your father right,0.06211884
now and it actually gave me goosebumps a little bit but he really did step,0.16205403
out of what a lot of people might consider a shadow by being the son,0.062108863
of Denzel Washington here he owned this role he gave so much to it he,0.028618196
was impeccable his screen presence he was on fire this is a fantastic performance an,0.056059018
atom driver as usual was magnificent all of the acting in the film especially for,0.028287599
some of the KKK who I imagine were having a very difficult time saying and,0.08071272
doing some of the things on screen they really committed to that role and despite,0.010247154
how funny this movie actually is it somehow is able to balance the darkness with,0.020001408
that light so beautifully because there are scenes where I was almost in tears laughing,0.027271865
and then in the next I'm wincing there's a scene where one person tells a,0.030937692
story about a horrific Allah violent act and it made me sick to my stomach,0.39343545
and like that's the power this film has the end credits in particular I was,0.022885643
almost in tears and and so there's a lot to like about this film really,0.021696296
the only real issue I can find with it that that bugged me throughout is,0.028279617
that it is a little too long perhaps it's just there's a few scenes where,0.019183896
the pacing isn't as good as it could be but Spike Lee has balanced those,0.031254318
tones of humor and darkness so beautifully and I think that's one of the most,0.026502246
important things you can look at when you watch a film is how the director,0.020053292
has balanced the tone and it's just about perfect black clansmen is easily Spike Lee's,0.04196444
best film in years and I'm gonna give it an a guys thank you so,0.024104925
much as always for watching but I also want to give a special thank you,0.025430636
