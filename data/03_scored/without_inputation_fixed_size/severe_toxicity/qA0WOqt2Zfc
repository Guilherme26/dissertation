hello welcome to R&B reviews I'm rob and a few months ago I actually back,0.023629319
in April I was i decided i was going to attempt to watch and review,0.026438389
every single film that was made by the classic comedy team the marx brothers who,0.038763575
starred in popular state shows in the 1920s and made a series of films in,0.022783205
the 1930s right up till the mid early 40's their first film was the coconut,0.019549748
which was made in 1929 and their last film was love happy which was made,0.022904934
in 1949 i managed to get through their first five films and i had to,0.036736764
take a break for a while because I some things came into my life where,0.12426562
I couldn't I just didn't have the time but now I think I can go,0.020149078
back to what I set out to do and try and review every single one,0.06252061
of their films and today I'm going to be reviewing a Night at the Opera,0.05619671
which is arguably their best film that was made in 1935 and it was originally,0.022338197
released by MGM and the plot is Groucho Marx plays business manager Otis be driftwood,0.043304786
who convinces his client mrs. Claypool played by Margaret Dumont to invest in the New,0.040504362
York opera company and Chico and Harpo Marx play comment who tries to convince Groucho,0.028171858
to consider their friend Alan Jones for the Opera Company while they're looking at other,0.010616996
people and arrange for you to unless you hundred thousand dollars in the New York,0.043293476
opera company I go to defense don't you see you'll be a patron of the,0.042781286
aircraft you'll get into society and you can marry me take you on a society,0.12798066
and all you've lost is to run about you know this smarts the first time,0.09870593
that the brothers made a movie at MGM after leaving paramount pictures as well as,0.026141718
their brother Zeppo behind behind and if you look at the early paramount films and,0.08447633
these later MGM ones you kind of do notice a bit of a difference for,0.06180155
one the brows were definitely much more family-friendly they became characters that the audience could,0.012328514
root for instead of people running around archaically poking fun at everyone now they only,0.16737019
poked fun at the films of these films and they were definitely much more alike,0.07889145
do you understand you're fired hey a big bully wants the idea of hitting that,0.32376516
little boys well you kinda let me handle my own affairs Cal now what do,0.067500174
you got to say to me justice can you sleep on your stomach with such,0.25307003
big buttons on your pajamas boy you many people have felt like this was kind,0.3132046
of out of character for Groucho Marx because Groucho poked fun at everybody but I,0.07117066
mean if you look at some movies like animal crackers and coconuts sometimes you would,0.10816285
go out of his way to help the leading man into romantic couples subplot even,0.088011116
though sometimes they could be a bit annoying but for some people that this was,0.08759537
a bit too much of a change to have him do that also another thing,0.03572768
you'll notice this groucho's lines are not all double entendres because of the new film,0.13830897
morals code that had came around where you couldn't talk about sex or drugs and,0.27968237
some stuff like that in the movies they could be clean wholesome fun which is,0.03281617
what kind of did Mae West in when she was making her films although watching,0.08001627
this movie I noticed that a few of these double attendre jokes kind of slipped,0.13162388
through the full sensor circuit I think we've got to keep everything on a business,0.047379702
faces how do you like that every time I get romantic with you want to,0.064599976
talk business I don't know there's something about me that brings out the business and,0.024755474
every woman also another thing you'll notice is romantic couples were more prominent granted the,0.041575972
romantic couple these young romantic subplot of these couples was prompt was always in Marx,0.057853017
Brothers movie since the coconuts but now they definitely are a little bit more forward,0.050601184
the reason was become this MGM didn't think Camille they're comedians could carry a film,0.047446217
on their own although duck soup and horse feathers that they made at Paramount showed,0.119490266
that they could NGM believe that the audience is wanted a variety of entertainment so,0.009700373
in these comedy musicals you've got comedy scenes musical numbers and you have the young,0.068887085
romantic couples to let the audience take a breath from their laughters in this film,0.07662051
of the couple is played by Alan Johnson kitty Carlisle they're definitely the more tolerable,0.019002302
ones in these energy m films and of course the formula changed Paramount's films like,0.031735245
I've been saying we're just most of them are just a bunch of gags strong,0.15392615
on a very thin storyline but here there is plot you get scenes where you,0.029490916
feel sorry for the marx's like there's a scene which I always remembers when grouches,0.11702243
getting kicked out of the Opera Company rather roughly in this movie and many people,0.10698348
find it depressing but that was the MGM formula if you look at the film's,0.055880748
and Jim films of Buster Keaton and red skeleton as well as the two films,0.033663616
Laurel and Hardy made over there warns of nothing but trouble they followed the formula,0.052125785
like one example in the character when the Communists are down and they decide that,0.055394497
there's nothing to do and they decide to step on up and mess with the,0.0377658
people who mess with them kind of like the Bugs Bunny cartoons where somebody messes,0.114208706
with puts money in bud spaces This Means War course you know This Means War,0.10227664
and he goes in and screw things up just to get back at them under,0.22650523
another thing you'll notice is Night at the Opera is a much more polished film,0.041662447
than the rough paramount films the what happened was the brothers went on tour to,0.028463874
try out these comedy scenes and the writers polished them love based on audiences reactions,0.09041509
which is why one of the reasons why I think coconuts and animal crackers worked,0.06922766
very well because they're dummies company seems so very well when they were doing the,0.270282
show wife and also not at the Opera contains some of their best comedy hits,0.062873825
including the famous contracts in between Groucho and Chico the state room scene where the,0.02186392
groucho is living in a little stateroom on a ship and people keep coming in,0.14040564
and out and there's also a very honorary underrated one with with the brothers eating,0.031878926
breakfast together at the whole tire agreement is automatically notified well I don't know it's,0.014554883
all right that that's an every contract that's that's what they call the sanity clause,0.019351523
you can't follow me there ain't no sanity glorious also the comedy in the night,0.09049358
the Opera is much more deliberately paced and it's not so rapid as it happened,0.035234112
before Chico gets to do a very verbal comedy bit like the ones Groucho used,0.09312837
to do and Alan Jones is definitely more likable as the leading in and some,0.011493708
of the later ones friends talk fast I see a man in the crowd with,0.049955294
a rope how we happen to come to America is a great story but I,0.11357213
don't tell that so now I tell you how we fly to America the first,0.041045822
time I we started we get a half way of course when we run outta,0.05260472
gasoline and we got to go back then I take a place in watching gasoline,0.12113061
this time we were just about the land may be creepy when what do you,0.0963585
think we're another gasoline again and the fact that we're going in to get the,0.014812309
mortgage that I didn't kick one of the things I didn't care for about 90,0.07355002
operas Margaret Dumont character to me just wasn't as memorable as mrs. Rittenhouse from animal,0.12043416
crackers or mrs. Teasdale from duck soup I think the reason is because here she,0.091886476
seems more annoyed at Groucho and just doesn't fine as attracted as they as she,0.06541616
had in those previous films another big problem that i have with some of these,0.05249363
later MGM films the Marx Brothers dudes is sometimes you have to fast-forward through the,0.03302304
musical numbers or the romantic subplots well if you watch something like horse feathers or,0.056972314
duck soup you don't have to fast-forward through anything it can just sit back relax,0.05603374
from beginning to end but regardless not if the opera is a I think despite,0.03935426
that the movie is very funny me it was never as good as duck super,0.08370139
animal crackers but they definitely the brothers definitely put on great great performances the bits,0.19662297
the comedy bits are again one of their best-known routines and I think they do,0.05279496
adapt to the changes very well I mean Groucho Marx said that this was one,0.029234156
of his favorite films that they had made a Night at the Opera is again,0.02225904
many people sue it as the start of the decline of their pictures but overall,0.045899667
it's definitely funny you may have to fast-forward through some stuff and obviously if you,0.048673484
don't like opera music you're going to probably fest go through some of the Opera,0.062124163
bits but I mean there's not too many of them in the movie but it's,0.079446875
a funny movie the brothers deliver despite some changes so if you're new to the,0.057869647
Marx Brothers this might be one you'd be willing to check out there's always been,0.018388337
debates about what type of Marx Brothers films that they like you like the early,0.044487484
roughhouse archaic ones they made it paramount or these later ones where they were more,0.03913342
likeable and you could root for them you know why don't you be if you,0.15670396
