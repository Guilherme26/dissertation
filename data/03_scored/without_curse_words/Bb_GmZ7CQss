Logan is directed by james mangold and is supposedly the last time we will ever,0.10100068
see Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine and Patrick Stewart playing Professor X in this movie which,0.15730911
is set quite far into the future we can see that all mutants are pretty,0.15134297
much extinct and Logan and Charles are pretty much hiding out in the middle of,0.114981495
nowhere trying to have very little to do with anything until this young girl called,0.28105944
Laura enters their lives who is on the run from an organization and she may,0.17209706
or may not be related to Logan in more ways than one believe it or,0.06404318
not this was my most anticipated movie of the year the trailers look very promising,0.06560554
it was nice to see James Mangold who directed the Wolverine which I actually quite,0.12243143
like coming back for this one and I also wanted to see how they were,0.06373678
going to handle Hugh Jackman's last outing as this character and I've gotta say they,0.077384114
did it in the best possible way they could have done because this movie is,0.056150686
amazing now due to the success of Deadpool this movie is rated fifteen or if,0.057764214
you live in America rated R and it shows I mean from the opening scene,0.14939353
alone you've got blood swearing and limbs flying everywhere and it's kind of satisfying as,0.3201862
the movie goes on you can tell that they are pushing this 15 rating as,0.07280478
much as they possibly can the swearing gets a lot more frequent the violence gets,0.15524353
a lot more gloria and brutal as the film goes on and there are a,0.17490286
couple of times near the start of the movie where you do feel as if,0.09693935
they're pushing it a little bit but by the time the movie kind of spreads,0.111277945
out and kind of evens out where the violence is in the movie it's kind,0.22179136
of a lot more easier to take in also all of this swearing and violence,0.37538338
doesn't just happen for the sake of swearing and violence it all feels very warranted,0.15384682
and actually feels worth it and this is easily backed up by James mangles superb,0.09091589
direction I mean this is easily the darkest comic book movie I can think of,0.1003769
since the dark night it's literally there's very little happiness in this movie there's a,0.14567275
couple of times that make you laugh but throughout the most of the movie it's,0.07958676
very dirty very grimy and just very depressing overall I mean not like I said,0.69608134
not the whole movie is depressing but it just has that very realistic and grounded,0.112820715
feel throughout the majority of the runtime the way they approach this movie by stripping,0.08803093
back a lot of the aspects most comic book movies nowadays have and making it,0.05483335
almost like a independent movie with it's very stylish yet gritty cinematography really shows and,0.07432068
actually makes the movie more personal than your average comic book movie the performances in,0.18774152
this movie are universally great but the two standouts are easily Hugh Jackman and Patrick,0.08056122
Stewart who give what could be argued as career best performances Hugh Jackman absolutely nails,0.105431035
it as Logan he's been playing this character for 17 years now but this is,0.050546814
easily the best he's ever been as this character he's broken he's aged you can,0.08927725
see that his healing factors not working the way it used to and all hope,0.05480413
that he did have is just gone he really does not trust anybody and doesn't,0.09563927
want to be around anybody because he knows that they will get hurt Patrick Stewart,0.17658678
on the other hand gives just as an emotional performance as Hugh Jackman does and,0.07354371
is kind of sad looking at Professor X now because the what they've done in,0.1449044
this movie is they've given his character a mental illness which plays around with the,0.40336108
telepathy and mind control powers that Professor X has and it makes his character really,0.08953194
vulnerable and kind of fragile and it's really sad to watch because you've seen these,0.11722868
two characters in their prime in previous movies and just seeing them in what looks,0.06308573
like a shell of what they used to be now it's kind of emotional and,0.10932828
also where Logan has just completely done with hope you can tell the child does,0.07949748
have a little bit of hope left even if it is a very desperate means,0.1005617
of the word hope but you can tell that he's trying to make Logan believe,0.060754288
again Daphne King as the little girl Laura I thought was very good even though,0.31089434
she barely says anything throughout the first two acts of the movie but she makes,0.16190779
up for it with some very convincing facial expressions and just by generally kicking ass,0.92186666
in all fairness I think she actually kills more people in this movie than Wolverine,0.60112625
does also Steven merchants in the movie and he's not as annoying as I thought,0.2414635
he was going to be he was actually a very good character I mean his,0.0989854
character could have been cut from the movie and it wouldn't have make difference but,0.057516485
I thought his performance was actually pretty good for what it was now unfortunately I,0.15643266
do have one very minor problem and that is regarding the villains now don't get,0.07246684
me wrong I actually quite liked the villains in this movie I thought they were,0.13415284
very interesting the motivations made sense for the sake of the movie and they were,0.05328606
both acted very well especially the guy who plays Donald pierce the guy with the,0.1853117
robotic hands from the trailers I thought he was specifically very good but they do,0.08747335
fall under the same problem that most MCU villains have which is the fact that,0.09476128
they're kind of there for the sake of being a bad guy and they're not,0.2907807
that memorable apart from that I absolutely loved this movie and it was everything I,0.08565417
wanted to see in a final installment like this the violence was incredibly brutal at,0.2405462
times hard to watch but yet they also knew when to be heartfelt and emotional,0.09173459
and actually made me tear up more than once and that's surprising because I don't,0.06290362
usually cry these kind of things the last time I cried at anything was when,0.112848416
David Tennant left Doctor Who like that alone made me a crippling mess on the,0.19872154
floor Logan kind of did the same thing as well and because of this i,0.12624557
have to give it a 10 out of 10 it satisfied everything i wanted to,0.1009675
see in movie plus a little bit more so guys that was my review of,0.16112678
Logan if you send the movie then let me know what you thought about it,0.08490852
