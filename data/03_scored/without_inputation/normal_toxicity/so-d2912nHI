what's going on ladies,0.14882432
and gentlemen my name is Luke Ennis,0.07047038
it's time for another horror movie review and this one is extra special,0.16931815
because this one is actually a review of something that was sent to me off of my Amazon wishlist by a very very kind person,0.10397817
by the name of Terry fernback otherwise known as mr.,0.09540671
T from Germany he if you go to my link in the description you will find the podcast we do together called iron cast with our third co-host check out some episodes of that it's really cool,0.10446537
and he very kindly sent me this to read today well ordered me this sur review today rather the cabinet of dr.,0.086204
Caligari from 1920,0.054954626
so the movie was directed by Robert vine or Wayne I'm not really sure how you pronounce the surname Andy Stiles werner krauss and Conrad vane again not sure I'm pronouncing those names exactly right but you know I don't speak German,0.15331927
so tensioning the film is the flashback of a man named Francis describing to a friend the terrible encounter that ruined the life of him and his fiancee the film essentially goes on in the flashback to tell the story of dr.,0.017401764
Caligari a hypnotist to present to the world his s'en ambulance it's very difficult Cesare and he is living unconsciously so to speak,0.31089434
and this is quite the spectacle for those who encounter him a string of murders happen across the town where the story takes place and people begin to suspect dr.,0.14931843
Caligari and and Caesar of being the perpetrators of these crimes this is the oldest movie on ever likely to review,0.11508627
and because there really aren't that many horror movies before in many ways it's the birth of the horror film as a feature as we know it you know I mean my sort specialist area when it comes to horror is the seventies and eighties I mean I that's the area that I'm most interested in spend most of my time with but that doesn't mean that something like this isn't interesting,0.10114545
and who's going to be playing art,0.0610706
critic a little bit on this one because you know all there really is to discuss here is the visuals,0.10447726
I guess you know as much as the story is interesting,0.058199387
yeah,0.040847696
this is very much a visual masterpiece more than anything else,0.078645766
all of the I guess in a title cards have a really beautiful art style,0.116234034
that's not something,0.055060927
I thought I've mentioned in a film review but they're all very they've all got a great kind of Art Deco feel to them,0.07046221
it's very it's very cool to see those you know the shapes that scatter the back of the cards and you know the fonts and stuff you know you,0.10008431
mostly you know kind of associate in a title cards from silent films has been you know just these things that flash up on the screen,0.07156715
but here there you are a bit of a feature in and of themselves and I mean the set design of the movie is just fantastic,0.15497768
it's absolutely brilliant,0.09207234
you know these all these sort of jaggedy buildings with these you know interesting times I mean obviously almost every movie made at this time was shot on sets,0.30300456
you know there was no location shooting really at this time,0.18119007
so you know there was there was an element of that in most great films at the time,0.10359052
but this movie takes it a step further,0.103868976
it's like a Picasso painting come to life,0.26334757
you know all these weirdly shaped buildings and these winding alleyways I guess that all ties in to the fact that it's a flashback you know,0.17848435
and this movie makes you aware that you're here in Reno an interpretation of an event and kind of a dream I guess in a way that doesn't necessarily portray reality you know as you get on towards the ending of the film you begin to realize that actually this is an unreliable narrator you're listening to and so details like that can be very you know you can't necessarily trust everything you see in the film if you want to put it like that I mean speaking of that ending you know for a movie made almost 100 years ago now it's a pretty kind twisted ending,0.102623746
actually you know that you know I'm not going to spoil it obviously putting it out there that that ending is really quite off the chain quite unsettling and you know the way that it,0.077004895
it comes together,0.07598327
you know like I say I think this is a movie that you know is kind of the birth of horror in a way you know,0.24233125
I can imagine this movie being incredibly shocking at this time you know given that I guess you know most most of filmmaking at this time had to be a bit nicey-nicey,0.11306219
you know to get something like this was what would have been very new and quite revolutionary really since its you know a review off of the wish list,0.093932614
I want to talk a little bit about this actual package itself,0.19421032
this is the two-disc limited edition from Eureka entertainment it includes,0.0651816
the is part of their masters of cinema series includes the documentary from Calgary to Hitler it also includes a few other funny little bits like am you know there's an audio commentary and all of that sort of thing in terms of special features on really think that this should have more on it you know given the amount of money this costs,0.122263946
I know you do pay a little bit more for steel books anyway but you know this this this blu-ray is kind of close to 30 pounds in the price range and I really think that for that sort of money you should be getting a little bit more than you get in this package in terms of the film itself the Prix is for the most part beautiful and they did have to source,0.083109766
the first act of the movie from an inferior source,0.24258806
and so that is quite noticeable the difference and in the start of the movie it's still perfectly watchable,0.05669545
though ultimately we are lucky to even be able to see this movie almost 100 years later when you consider the amount of movies that just considered lost from that time that no one has any idea if any prints even exist of any more and it has to be said man there really,0.060059085
I can't imagine there's a better way to watch the cabinet dr.,0.05465732
Caligari than this I'd like to say the actual print on the movies is you know the best quality of going to see for the film,0.063612215
and you know the color tint is really nice as well you know the what they've done with Bay's is quite admirable,0.0836027
actually overall,0.052702058
I'd say that this set definitely isn't for everyone,0.076653674
but I mean if you want to throw down the money you are going to get a quality set and if you can you know put aside the kind of not lack of bonus features because there are plenty of bonus features but then it's the level of bonus features you'd expect from saying an arrow video release and those are great releases of course but I mean when you think about they're you know they're real limited edition releases which don't cost as much as visted,0.10589512
you know like The Texas Chainsaw - limited edition that has like two discs of just bonus features basically this really first money should have more but other than that is a pretty very pretty cool,0.06494465
set I've got so overall cabinet of,0.1346023
dr. Caligari is you know the head of its field really in terms of you know silent,0.14694697
horror,0.19055113
German expressionist cinema is a is a really really interesting movie to watch it's not that long you know this,0.24034387
it's a nice easy easy watch in terms of finding the time to sit down and get into it and yet so it's a real Trailblazer,0.12048669
I mean I see no reason why this film isn't worthy of a nine out of ten there really aren't any problems with it that I can I can point out yeah overall the cabinet,0.10886015
dr.,0.049754996
