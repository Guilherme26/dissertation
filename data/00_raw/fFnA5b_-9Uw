this family was shady to the tea and I was here for all of it hey everyone is sure under four payer weights and today I'm gonna be reviewing knives out which I had the pleasure of seeing at the Toronto International Film Festival this movie was directed and written by Rian Johnson who you may know from writing and directing films such as the last Jedi Wilbert the Brothers Bloom and the list goes on and on this film stars so many people so if I don't remember everybody's name did not charge it to my heart just charges to my mind because it's a lot of y'all so this film stars on a de Armas Jayden Jayden Martel Chris Evans Katherine lamb for Lukey Stansfield Jamie Lee Curtis Don Johnson Daniel Craig Toni Collette Christopher Plummer is so many I just I can't can you try to name everyone but you know who's in it if not go look it up on IMDB alright so for those of you who are new to my channel I tell you what I liked about the film what I didn't like about the film is should you pay her wait to see this film in theaters I'm so essentially nice out is a whodunit murder mystery and so the centers around the slamby family they're a rich family the patriarch of the family is played by Christopher Plummer who was Harlan thrombi and so he is a crime novelist who has made tons of coins and so unfortunately after his birthday he wise up dead and no one knows who did it what has happened but mysteriously a private investigator by the name of Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig he is hired to investigate who was responsible for the murder and so from then on the movie really details his investigation getting to know this crazy thrombi family and trying to figure out who done it so yes so that's pretty much all I want to give away I'm gonna be very vague about this because I want to sense it it's kind of like this mystery film I really want to make sure I don't give any spoilers away so this is going to be a spoiler free review so going into what I loved about this film guys this is a star-studded cast for knives out I'm actually I get very apprehensive of films that just have so many talented actors in it sounds like girl like how do you get like how does it make you feel it easy but because there's so many actors in the film sometimes I feel as though that some people get lost in the wayside you don't really get to focus on everyone so it's not always an enjoyable experience for films like this for me but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised I was proved wrong everyone in this film is so talented they're so captivating what you want when you watch them on screen and literally as each character is introduced they all still the show I think that they do a very great job of balancing screen time for all the characters of course some are going to get more than others but I think that everyone was very memorable even after walking out of the film so I haven't talked about who my favorites were first and foremost Daniel Craig who is this Detective this famous detective who has higher deceptive Blanc he is absolutely hilarious he is this over-the-top investigator who have like this strong southern accent and it's almost feels as though that he's making fun of his character at the same time but it's not too over the top where it starts to become like borderline on parody I think everything is balanced and done just right and he was so hilarious to watch I can watch a whole series just based off of his character them coming up with different murder mysteries I'm totally here for their franchise since we want to turn everything else to a French shock that we didn't ask for this is what I'm actually asking for and I think that everyone will be on board with me as well also to Toni Collette who plays um she's married into the family she's the daughter in law she is so fun to watch I just need Toni Collette to be in every movie I think I would totally be fine with that her accent her demeanor of this character she is so fun to watch I just loved her so much but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Chris Evans not that I didn't know that he was going to do a good job but he plays ransom who is really this just just evil and greedy freeloading son of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Josh's characters I was just like Chris like I like the sight of you now like we've never seen Chris Evans play a bad guy before but I have to say I was really entertained by his character the language that he had in the film is so nice to see him kind of brushing off rendering these different characters that kind of get out of his like nice guy persona I can't wait to see how much more we see from kids Chris Evans within that couple of titles that he's working on but I will have to say our lead of the entire film Ana de Armas who plays Marta who was the caregiver for mr. army before his untimely death I loved her character and I really think that they did a very great job with the marketing for this film only with the trailer you really don't get to see how much she has to do with the film is one of the characters that you would think that will basically be overlooked but I love how she does such a great job of captivating your attention of carrying this film with this star said it cast she was absolutely a great standout for me and I loved what they did with her character and I'm not gonna give anything away but I think that she will enjoy it as well but I would have to say the star of this film has to go to Ryan Jackson by white he's not in the film his writing for knives out this movie is so funny I did not expect this movie to be as funny as it was I was literally laughing from beginning to the end of the film the entire theater was in tears from laughing and I will have to say is done too it's because of the great script that he wrote the social commentary that comes from this family the salt the dynamics in between the different family members he does such a fantastic job with this screenplay it's just like he makes fun of both sides I know a lot of people who tried to say like oh this is like only attacking one side no like everybody gets it there is like not one person who doesn't get a jab at one another I just thought it's so brilliantly done the the comedy is so cleverly written also to like he'll pay homage to kind of like this this mystery genre this murder mystery I thought that there was a lot of Easter eggs not only in the dialog with some of the characters some of the things that they say I guess if you're kind of thinking of those type of films those type of even novelist that you've read like it would definitely hit you and then even some of the easter-egg some of the things that are happening in the background I think that he did a very great job of kind of playing homage to some of the other films that we may have seen maybe TV shows I don't want to give too much away but I just thought it was so well done how he just so effortlessly put like these little tidbits throughout the film I think that a lot of people will pick up on it as I did while watching knives out do I have anything negative to say about knives out I do not I had such a great time when I walked out of this theater I literally had a smile on my face Sallie Mae could call me assess Sharonda we just Auto tracked it your you know student loan payment early and I wouldn't even be mad and you guys know how I feel about Sallie Mae's that's how happy that this movie made me feel this is definitely one of the best films that I've seen in 2019 mainly due to the comedy how well-written and then the talent in this film how well acted this film was even though they're kind of making fun of themselves at the same time this is definitely hitting my top 10 list of 2019 just gonna let you guys know that right now like spoiler alert or like exclusive however you guys want to say it I had a great time when I was out I am sure that everyone is really going to enjoy this film one of my favorites from TIFF what I was saying to do with me and my coin is what I'm gonna tell you guys to do when I was out I would tell you to pay to see this film in theaters guys the cast the writing is
