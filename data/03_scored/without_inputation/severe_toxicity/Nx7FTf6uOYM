hey there guys so before we talk about Wonder Woman I first need to show,0.039904367
you this Wonder Woman is the latest film in the DC Universe of comic book,0.06211352
movies and they needed this to be a good movie and not only that I,0.05038899
think we all needed this to be a phenomenal movie to restore our faith in,0.04925951
the DC United was this a good movie hang on just one second and we'll,0.11163511
talk about that this will be directed by patty Jenkins who's mostly known for drinking,0.083946176
TV shows and I would say her most famous movie is monster which is also,0.17079721
about female empowerment in a very dark weird disgusting way now let's talk about Batman,0.41625968
V Superman like it or hate it one of the best surprises about that movie,0.053946394
was gal gadot as Wonder Woman and as far as gal gadot performance gal gadot,0.010875087
"gal gadot Yaga doesn't matter how I say her name 27,000 people down below in",0.25779697
the comments will say I said it wrong even if I say it right I'm,0.018230023
just going to refer to gal gadot as Wonder Woman from now on because in,0.043690592
my head that's who she is now now as far as her performance goes in,0.041824088
this film as Wonder Woman I really bought into it she brought a different element,0.032872044
that I wasn't quite expecting she have subtleties about her and I really enjoy that,0.043820303
I really enjoyed her natural foreign accent as Wonder Woman it made me bind to,0.05517033
the character and you really felt like she was from this foreign magical and mystical,0.017908074
faraway land in the movie when she's holding up her shield and swinging her sword,0.1915822
and wrapping the lasso of truth around people I was thinking to myself that is,0.042187277
Wonder Woman and I was also thinking I want her to wrap the lasso of,0.06570285
truth around me that just sounds like a really good time now the first act,0.05474927
of this movie is a straight-up origin story and it takes place on the island,0.04750276
of thermus kara you see a young Princess Diana training to be a warrior one,0.0687627
day and I really appreciated how quickly the film progressed and didn't drag out her,0.03720971
training sequences and it just got on with the rest of the story and one,0.014957319
of the best things about this film is the chemistry between Chris Pines character and,0.009990393
Wonder Woman throughout this movie Chris Pines character is this world war one spy named,0.04822648
Steve Trevor's and he and Princess Diana essentially had the same objective - in the,0.011655347
war the most interesting thing is they both have different beliefs on how to stop,0.14877298
the war ones realistic and ones mythological and for the most part I said it,0.11362268
was really clever how they tied in this mythological backstory into real-life events like world,0.040628754
war one but now let's talk about the character of Steven Rogers in this film,0.1102502
that's right I just said Steven Rogers aka Captain America and I don't feel mistaken,0.07024672
when I say that because in the film Wonder Woman the character Steven Trevor's is,0.0074307667
essentially Captain America without the Super Soldier Serum and speaking of Captain America the First,0.035501517
Avenger it also feels like the film Wonder Woman borrows a few plot elements from,0.0124243
that movie and puts it into this one and that's not even a complaint I,0.07365113
actually don't mind and I think Wonder Woman is the better movie I do have,0.109547764
a few other quick positives to mention about the film and we'll dive into everyone's,0.04697394
favorite part the negatives with the movie one other aspect I really enjoyed about this,0.042585723
film was the fish-out-of-water story you had this character a Wonder Woman who's never been,0.03138004
off to this island filled with the chicks she's never even seen a dude before,0.25668913
and then you can't go and place her in this new environment everything that she's,0.060681377
seeing and doing for the first time was really entertaining and comedic to watch and,0.024694277
speaking of the comedy aspect in this movie sometimes when it comes to superhero comic,0.035228126
book movies when they interject that forced comedy to make people laugh and add levity,0.1144189
to the movie sometimes it takes me out of the movie and I'm just like,0.032345884
let's take serious let's go into battle kick some ass I don't need to laugh,0.6947338
about something stupid but in this movie it works but one of the best things,0.30281934
that this movie does is it makes you buy into the character or Wonder Woman,0.021404944
and there's one scene that you've seen in the trailers so I'm not spoiling anything,0.05557676
there's a scene in this film that takes place during World War 1 in the,0.07688791
trenches you have soldiers they're down-and-out there's blood there's guts there's gore it's pg-13 so,0.2230833
there's no guts or gore blood but it was the one scene in this film,0.17116839
where I bought in to Wonder Woman it's where I got goosebumps all over me,0.17348056
because she climbs out of this trench she D robes wearing the costume walking straight,0.16762163
at the enemies I just love scenes like that like it literally gives me goose,0.089244366
bumps down my arms now here are my negatives with the movie Wonder Woman as,0.12748577
I hold this sword now Wonder Woman once again is a comic book superhero movie,0.12425963
and this movie has a lot of cliches in it that you've seen in other,0.06425674
move but I will say this movie handles those cliches as well as it possibly,0.11853839
can now let's talk about the villains of this film there's multiple villains in this,0.033056967
movie and I didn't really enjoy any of them you have the dude who played,0.051561046
William Stryker in x-men origins playing once again another villain he craves power and he'll,0.07722383
do anything to get it and I hate to keep comparing this movie to Captain,0.09120799
America the First Avenger but this Nazi character and Wonder Woman was essentially Red Skull,0.26591495
but without the Red Skull and much like Captain America the First Avenger he also,0.17462334
has a sidekick character who's an evil scientist named dr. poison and yeah as far,0.22910453
as dr. poison goes in this film she was the most cliched over-the-top character in,0.19664225
the entire film and every time she was on screen it sort of took me,0.025470547
out of the movie she just really came across like this very heavy-handed one-dimensional evil,0.0958636
scientist and also at the very end of the movie much like every comic book,0.048477918
movie that comes out nowadays it gets super heavy-handed with the CG to the point,0.05156171
where it just feels like actors are standing in front of a green screen with,0.031746555
a fan blowing on them and it's forgivable for the most part because in a,0.23372969
superhero movie with godlike powers you have to have this big destruction battle scene but,0.06680905
I just was expecting a little something more out of this movie something a little,0.049746424
bit more subtle now here are my final flicking thoughts on Wonder Woman this is,0.07650477
arguably the best DC Universe film since Man of Steel I prefer Man of Steel,0.019082123
just a little bit more over this movie but I can understand if you like,0.070607245
this movie more than Man of Steel I really felt like they did everything that,0.054153267
they possibly could with the character of Wonder Woman to make you like the character,0.016061524
to make you get behind the character to give her an origin story that was,0.022271013
interesting Wonder Woman isn't a perfect movie but when it comes to a Wonder Woman,0.11298876
movie I really feel like it was the best thing that they possibly could have,0.048564393
done with her so I'm going to give the movie Wonder Woman aa a B+,0.06980969
it's a solid movie it's really entertaining go check it out but I didn't really,0.020870803
