fascinating to watch this film more from one thing to another and just have no,0.09322705
idea what could possibly come next so yes I would definitely recommend avoiding information about,0.094563894

summary you're still going to find plenty of surprises in there and you're going to,0.066902705
enjoy the hell out of it one of my favorite things about parasite is how,0.44395998
masterfully bong joon-ho handles these genre shifts that happen throughout the film you have satire,0.14524853
and black comedy you have a family drama you have suspense that crosses over into,0.3600902
thriller territory and all of it is flavored with really well-done social commentary the film,0.08825268
has this beautiful flow to it that is very reminiscent of a stage performance and,0.10151821
it made so much sense when I was watching and reading interviews with bong joon-ho,0.17098619
afterwards and hearing him talk about how important the rhythm of the film is to,0.07148396
him and how what parasite in particular he started off with an idea of it,0.5499798
being a stage play the pacing is exactly what it needs to be as well,0.061679043
the beginning shows us all we need to know about the two families one after,0.031790376
the other and as the film goes along it keeps ramping up it keeps winding,0.05293491
the tension like a spring until we get to the culmination where well you're just,0.09721403
going to have to watch and find out how that goes another thing I loved,0.06415665
about this film is that there aren't any heroes or villains here all of the,0.11344196
characters are various shades of grey and each and every one of them has their,0.084144115
own faults parasite is not interested in pointing fingers or taking sides instead it shows,0.31089434
the problem of the gap between the rich and the poor it shows a conflict,0.18885593
and the lack of understanding between classes and while every character is looking out for,0.072043814
their own the audience is left wondering if coexistence is possible at all can the,0.043504376
invisible line be crossed is there a solution or is it just that no matter,0.067280516
how the power dynamics shift someone will always end up being a host and someone,0.113801
else a parasite the film relies on this delicate balance of characters and ideas which,0.3837945
could have easily fallen apart in the hands of a less skilled director or came,0.10117267
off heavy-handed with a less masterful script but parasite maintains this balance perfectly from beginning,0.4475354
to end while also shifting genres and keeping the audience 100% invested in every minute,0.05776166
of its runtime honestly it's amazing this movie even exists of course all of it,0.13929963
is tied together through visuals starting with the architecture which the director had a very,0.04307673
specific vision for he'll they actually ended up building a whole neighborhood just so the,0.088746175
semi basement apartment of the poor family would be exactly what it needed to be,0.18834855
reflecting that in-between status of the family not quite ready to give up on their,0.10020278
situation often throughout the film themes and ideas are represented in a very visual way,0.019063609
which is something I am a big fan of because visual metaphors are always fun,0.036616664
however I cannot tell you the details because that would get me into spoilers one,0.18461737
thing you can be sure off though is that none of the visual choices are,0.03828232
random so paying attention to details is definitely worth it here finally before I wrap,0.06752918
