got home that you know everything from the cast the cast was phenomenal to the,0.02723794
score so let's get a little bit into the cast I think there has to,0.040371325
be some Oscar nominations here for of course Sally Hawkins she was phenomenal in this,0.019370813
film she was just really great and she she does the whole ASL sign language,0.04766706
thing and she got kind of got a little bit backlash because I guess that,0.03924517
community was like saying you know what they're not really portraying how we really doing,0.047953088
stuff like that um but I'm not sure if excuse me if they really if,0.041728966
they seen the film now like if it's the same or different you know but,0.00970902
for me she did a really good job for in the performance overall yeah and,0.024237296
she was really good so I think most likely I feel like they're gonna give,0.034871586
her a nomination for that but another like as always guys Michael Shannon for me,0.050461497
it's just a phenomenal actor one of my favorite actors working today and I feel,0.029560762
like he's underrated I feel like he should have gotten nominated last year for nocturnal,0.043589484
animals for Best Supporting Actor and yeah but he was phenomenal as the villain and,0.06888642
man he they really do some some cool stuff with him he kind of just,0.085975654
embraces that whole villain like really good but same time in the movie I feel,0.07515511
like he do something's different with him kind of making you kind of feel for,0.04536619
him and kind of make him kind of bring him home and stuff like that,0.059041034
you know so you kind of couldn't tell what kind of life he has you,0.12278891
know at the same time he kind of I loved that he kind of just,0.042737383
pursues more he wants to be that that Top Gun you know that top guy,0.03289466
and he's trying to you know please is his a higher ups and stuff like,0.038607925
that but I yeah Micro Chanin he did a phenomenal job and another I feel,0.044245355
like Michaels not gonna get nominated because Rick Richard Jenkins man he was just so,0.050827347
good in this film you have to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor you know,0.034572255
he just did a phenomenal job and he they did some really interesting things with,0.023771003
his characters and you know normally water won't see normally I don't want to get,0.011365328
into that little debate or their little topic but yeah I was just surprised how,0.031691343
that decided to go through what scared him bug me or any issues okay cool,0.09936912
you know um you know you just don't expect that from like films you know,0.052419797
like they don't get that deep within these characters and their psyche and how they,0.019481234
how they do things and you know and so really there was one scene in,0.021369025
particular that I really liked him like when that little moment happened again no spoilers,0.03244367
my audience was like you know I was like well you can kind of tell,0.060503773
you know and I really liked that moment too because it sets up you know,0.027700242
his his character and the other person had to diner that's all I'm gonna say,0.052744407
or yeah the diner but I really liked that scene um but overall Richard ring,0.027380954
is just knocks it out of the park in this Octavia Spencer she just does,0.0321011
her thing you know I always feel like she's funny and everything but she you,0.05775058
can kind of that's the thing about this movie that I can see the Octavia,0.048132025
Spencer you know she did her like role that she always liked in supporting roles,0.020689873
she's funny and stuff like that like this earlier this year pretty sure she's been,0.097911045
in a lot of stuff this year but earlier this year she was in a,0.033555854
gifted starring Chris Evans and I thought she was really good in that as well,0.032242116
a little supporting role but the thing about this film that for each character even,0.014201006
those supporting characters they have like a nice I don't see arc but they have,0.016180592
nice little character development moments and stuff like that and throughout the whole like first,0.038006596
few scenes that Octavius was with Sally I'm forgetting their their names I think one,0.0374831
of them's Zelda I think in the other one was Lisa or something not sure,0.041389722
I should remember these characters names but and I was even talking to myself about,0.01907015
the movie on the way home and I never remember the names but now I'm,0.023567457
just blanking but even in the beginning with those two characters you can kind of,0.019389438
hear Octavia in the background whereas Ali's doing her thing she's in the background she's,0.037624784
talking about her like husband stuff like that and you know kind of can come,0.05623795
full circle at the end I was really nice to see you know but yeah,0.034257624
and even Doug Jones I feel like he's just one of those actors you don't,0.037256937
really know that he's like in that role but I think I think he did,0.026438389
a great job for what it's worth you know you can't really see that he,0.040763784
did a performance like facial wise you know obviously but overall you can kind of,0.087486945
he did a great job because of that like he was I was gonna say,0.08472976
real quick to that I don't know I think he was he was in a,0.045261756
practical suit I'm not sure that's another thing about this if they have like visuals,0.042058896
effects like CGI it was really great because I was just thinking it was real,0.031520393
like a pr√°cticas a gear model so obviously he that he uses real of practical,0.04832027
effects and something now he's he's uh okay I say how could I say he,0.10393029
really likes using them um so to been anything about her right now or it,0.1552073
was like his suit yeah a little bit I don't think it was and that's,0.099389076
amazing if it wasn't um but anyways Doug Collins did a pretty good job my,0.050683003
gosh and like I said the whole cast I really liked the cast and their,0.07301655
character so like that that's the thing characters you know that uh so here my,0.016653538
little Toro we could talk about him he's just phenomenal in this film he doesn't,0.057155903
started it but he just he just knocked out of the park with everything was,0.07240657
was the the story in in the way it's shot to Scimitar if he's beautiful,0.20088878
to score I really noticed a score in this film and I believe his name,0.03139933
is uh Alexandre de plus or another plus this flat I think not sure how,0.07477994
you spell he says that same but he didn't feel homage on this I think,0.060795125
he did some of the Harry Potter movies and he's worked with forgetting his name,0.010112122
but he did move right a moon moonrise kingdom and he also did mr. Fox,0.02926808
phantom mr. fantastic Fox I think I'm forgetting the director's name but he he's he's,0.049022038
one of my favorites but he the he the composer he'd that he's done a,0.03402614
lot of good scores and this was no different so I've noticed score really early,0.01017997
on to insert ography obviously garam also visually visually you know he focus on visuals,0.06389421
as well you can tell his previous films um but in this film I think,0.03184966
you know sometimes I gotta say that he kind of gets to carry to wait,0.037223678
a little bit with visuals maybe that's what it's like Pacific Rim I enjoyed Pacific,0.028287599
room I own it but a lot of people say you know it's kind of,0.048392776
not up there for in his films but yeah guys I just overall I don't,0.07908834
know what else to say about the movie the the the score was great scimitar,0.06615517
feel directing the cast the story itself I had a great time at the theater,0.025775867
that's something I kind of didn't really expect you know from this these movies is,0.021722902
I love watching movies and these could have been ways for me like more Oxford,0.059861872
ish movies I guess they're really great films and stuff like that but you don't,0.03455895
find yourself at theatre kind of like having fun I guess unless because these are,0.06584653
more like darker films and so like the more more serious films I should say,0.070955805
more drama driven films but this one was a little bit different I was having,0.043908108
fun following these characters in this journey and stuff so overall guys if I had,0.024653701
to rate the shape of water I think I have to give it an 8.5,0.024738844
out of 10 it was just a really great movie I I seems like I'm,0.058417093
giving a lot of movies 8.5 um this year looking like when I look back,0.024055036
at my scores but there's just one scene a real quick that kind of just,0.03270974
kind of came out of nowhere for me you know and in you kind of,0.12549089
involving like some singing I just thought there was a lot of great stuff little,0.040363345
cared little character details and stuff like that a lot of great stuff in a,0.029080499
movie you know with the Richard Jenkins character and his painting it's just a lot,0.037226338
of stuff I really loved about this movie but I don't know I just feel,0.054175884
like at the end of the day like I I just didn't really kind of,0.036780663
I don't know III I'm thinking about that scene way too much but just that,0.042180624
scene kind of took me out you know in so I think that's a good,0.08835767
score in my opinion it's one of my favorites of the year so yeah if,0.02763572
