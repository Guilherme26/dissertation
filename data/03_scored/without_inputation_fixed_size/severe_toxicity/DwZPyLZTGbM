so this is probably the most hyped movie this year when it comes to the,0.025636178
award season but from the first moment I heard about it it seemed boring to,0.01836439
me that was pretty much my initial reaction to it oh this looks boring and,0.03953253
that's just me being honest here and it doesn't really matter to me how much,0.025672097
hype or praise the movie gets if it doesn't appeal to me on a gut,0.0867925
level I'm not gonna be that excited to watch it that being said there's still,0.037457157
a pretty good chance I like it when I do sit down and watch it,0.111897856
and I fully expected to be proven wrong here I expected to end up liking,0.040971987
it well you can probably tell where this is going yeah I didn't like it,0.019913603
and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it about five minutes into it because,0.044174846
the title sequence sets the tone for this thing pretty much perfectly if you like,0.038805485
the title sequence you'll love this movie and I definitely didn't I mean during the,0.024147497
first scene after the titles I just went oh for sake because at that point,0.030867182
I knew exactly what I was in for and I just had no interest so,0.024539955
what's the deal here it's a black-and-white movie by Alfonso Cuaron said in Mexico in,0.10211101
the 70s the same guy who made children of men and gravity the first one,0.07608437
is great the other one visually stunning but story-wise kind of meh but this one's,0.019468594
a bit different this one is about a maid who lives with this wealthier family,0.03353989
and she seems kinda like a part of the family actually they treat her very,0.03509176
well and the kids well her and it's almost as much about the family itself,0.028340815
as it is about her except the stories told entirely through her and the movie,0.029481605
follows her and I mean I have nothing against the core story here or the,0.027879177
characters or how its shot or any of that Quarren knows what he's doing it's,0.14250496
more about the pacing and how it's put together and presented this thing moves at,0.021375012
a glacial pace and the thing is there's nothing complex going on here it's a,0.033268496
very straightforward story this is a 90-minute movie if I ever saw one but it's,0.016440013
actually 2 hours 15 minutes I mean I could tell you everything important that happens,0.038611248
in this movie in about two sentences now I'm obviously not gonna do that there's,0.026918652
some new ones there but it's essentially a movie about changes challenges and moving on,0.015771504
and my main issue was that I just didn't care about anything that was going,0.033128142
on not necessarily because the stuff itself wasn't compelling but because of the way it,0.02406834
was presented the presentation board the living out of me and I love dramas I,0.065824576
don't mind a swell movie and I don't mind long movies either but the pacing,0.036422797
needs to be good and it needs to be either really interesting or really entertaining,0.03753764
and this just wasn't I mean I just reviewed the house that Jack built which,0.026560118
is longer than this and it's a slow burn too but I liked it because,0.053462803
for the most of it it was either interesting or entertaining and to me this,0.04210147
wasn't however that last act the last 45 minutes or so I didn't hate I,0.032705083
actually kind of liked it at least I liked some aspects of it because it,0.04335068
felt like an actual movie it had some momentum it moved forward things happened I,0.05753506
even got a bit invested in what was going on unfortunately the first hour and,0.04542273
a half didn't have that and I can't remember being so utterly bored by a,0.014475062
movie in a long time and in the interest of being completely transparent here I,0.029985813
seriously considered shutting it off and I told myself no one knows you're gonna review,0.052163035
this no one cares just shut it off and this misery now but I stuck,0.25122726
with it and well I don't know if it was worth it but at least,0.052704494
it got better so there's that and now I'm sitting here trying not to be,0.029637257
too harsh because this thing obviously struck a chord with people but the bottom line,0.08776233
is I thought this thing was incredibly boring for most of the runtime and that's,0.0712711
just the truth and that's just my opinion so take that for what it's worth,0.05794681
but it also means I don't see how I could possibly recommend it so maybe,0.028423963
