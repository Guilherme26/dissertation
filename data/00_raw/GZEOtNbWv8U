and that movie it mean places that I didn't even know I had cutting the onions around here fun fact I've never cried while cutting onions so I don't know what this is I didn't cry in the cinema although normally when I go to the cinema I cry my eyes out with fantastic beats I cried like a maniac but this time I was like I need to drive I need to get food I can be like it would have food so I kept my tears in but they're coming up now let's get on to the review hello everybody its Selena that and welcome to Mexican TV I don't even know what that was but I'm taking it so since I'm a huge movie and TV show fan I was like I need to make a channel because nobody wants to hear my opinions about movies and TV shows so I'm like why not I make videos about it so the first movie that I'm gonna give her a few is a star is born so from the first clip that you might have seen is a someone was cutting an onion I'm so glad I didn't do that in the cinema because it was coming out of my toes can tears come out of your toes like a star was born is a heavy drama a musical drama directed by Bradley Cooper himself he plays the famous country singer who is also an alcoholic and when I say alcoholic he takes everything that God forbid he meets this beautiful young woman Lady Gaga who happens to have a beautiful voice and is super talented and he takes her on the road he let her sing a song with him he even flew her out and Heller Haller the drama starts there I'm not a big fan of Lady gaga I never rough a part of the rah-rah-rah clan it doesn't matter I think this woman is phenomenal but would get to that part a later on what I didn't like was that there was one part that part was supposed to be super emotional and Bradley Cooper who plays Jackson main was like and he looked up and there were no tears no tears hunting you give yourself millions and you don't give me tears really there were a few moments in the movie where I was like oh where is this going it's taking a bit long and therefore oh this is where it was going ok ok this movie is also the third remake of this story I think it is amazingly done if you're into I want to cry a lot I want to see a heavy drama I want to know but the raw side of being an artist is because I think this can apply to all artists out there and you should really go with this movie I was also really happy to see shangela and Willem does oh one of my favorite drag queens of all times and I'm glad it didn't just have one line they had a few lines and they were so true to themselves it made the movie even come alive because I know these people for I've been following these people for a while now and to see them that made me laugh so it's also you were in this movie and I just can't get around how well done it is the acting oh my god I already told you that I'm not a big fan of Lady Gaga but I appreciate her as an artist but oh my god that woman can sing and act and normally when people suppose the thing stick and - singing when it comes to acting but this she did an amazing job it felt so real and so natural and the chemistry that these two have Bradley Cooper and Lady got is just I think you should really go and see this movie it has a message the message was so clear to me that it hitted me in places that I didn't even know our hand I was like is this what what whoa chills all over and even the day after I saw the movie I still felt what it did to me and what it had done to me it basically ruined my life it inspired me to do better to be better and to keep on following my dream I don't think I can see this movie ever again because it will crush me but this is one of the most view for movies I've seen this year I highly suggest it and I give this movie a 5 out of 5 stars it was amazing even the side parts were well done everything was so well done but be prepared for a lot of close-ups everything is filmed like this so you can actually see it everything I want to say everything you can see everything I think they tried to create this intimate clothes you are here movement in the movie and it helped because I felt like I was there but I'm someone who doesn't like to be too close to be able so I was like whoa this is close well this is also really close but besides all of that I think again you should go and see this movie if you have let me know in a comment box down below and I can't wait to share more videos with you guys on this channel so this is my first video I hope you liked it if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you don't think I don't know why you keep watching this I will see you in my next video but
