hi everybody my name is Steph Koza and today I'm going to review the shape,0.03120842
of water the shape of water is directed by Guillermo del Toro back at it,0.015477493
again never disappoints and the story is set in the 1960s where a young mute,0.05709005
janitor named Eliza works in a research facility where she discovers this very strange peculiar,0.06365675
mysterious aquatic creature this movie had me hooked from the first trailer just the way,0.081131786
that it looks the style the very weird mysterious vibe that it has I knew,0.031236358
that I wanted to see this movie I just instantly was like that looks awesome,0.087487616
and it's a little bit difficult to describe because it is very strange but it's,0.03748842
essentially like Bioshock Meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon which yes is very weird,0.12865782
but it makes for an amazing movie every shot looks very Bioshock like I love,0.20126662
the feeling of Bioshock I love the way that it looks and it has that,0.03464742
exact same vibe of the 60s very dark and gritty it's nighttime almost the entire,0.04090015
movie because Elijah works the night shift so it's dark with lots of cool tones,0.04495777
lots of that like 1960s mint green teal color everywhere it has a very industrial,0.057978738
feel and there's also a lot of water imagery because this creature is this weird,0.052174345
like Creature from the Black Lagoon thing it's just really cool to watch even if,0.18369912
the plot was terrible it's a beautifully stunning movie but thankfully the plot is far,0.067316584
from the terrible this movie is a very strange unexpected love story between Eliza this,0.032231472
mute janitor and The Creature from the Black Lagoon I think it's a little bit,0.19523539
more than a love story it's about much more than that it's about their connection,0.022668129
rather than their romantic interest in Sally Hawkins performance as this very confident mute girl,0.058137715
is absolutely amazing and very compelling she doesn't say a word for the entire film,0.036480665
but you can understand her feelings and her emotions based on just her facial expressions,0.11939381
in the way that she moves I think this is probably my favorite performance from,0.033463392
both Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon Shannon is this really malevolent villain who just is,0.108509414
so evil like you just I don't know something about him you just love to,0.2940102
hate him like just love it and Jenkins is sort of like Eliza's best friend,0.35485744
slash father figure who you just kind of want to give him a hug the,0.03748576
entire time Octavia Spencer is also fantastic as always she's amazing and she is another,0.06304145
janitor that Eliza works with she's kind of like her friend slash like caretaker almost,0.053073008
and she's very sassy and I love it the movie toys with the idea of,0.18288693
being an outcast and being an outsider where essentially everybody around you judges you and,0.055394497
I think that's a really relatable concept for almost everyone it's a very relatable movie,0.014425837
despite its very strange plot lines because I think everyone has felt like an outsider,0.053275224
at least some point in their life but when you think about it it's not,0.03091973
just the creature in this movie that's the outsider at first glance yeah the creature,0.08500515
is weird and everyone's like what is this thing we need to do experiments on,0.054081425
it and test it and we can't have any involvement with it because it's this,0.025491167
far away ostracized thing but when you look at the movie a creature isn't the,0.05945611
only outcast we have janitors we have a mute we have an african-american woman we,0.29521754
have a homosexual man we have a Russian guy who kind of just wants to,0.25603178
be an American and the fact that this movie is set in the 60s makes,0.021289203
all of those characters incredibly more ostracized but it turns into this beautiful unexpected love,0.07738481
story between Eliza and the creature and it takes very bold and daring moves there,0.02240405
are a lot of scenes that I would have never expected the kind of toys,0.057676744
with how far it can go and how weird it can get without really feeling,0.028211769
that weird it almost feels like the plot of a old classic film like girl,0.10005227
falls in love with monster it's very like King Kong that kind of thing it's,0.19666222
a very classic idea that hasn't really been brought to light recently but it also,0.014828939
has a very modern twist and it does feel a little weird and a little,0.033368938
off and there are a lot of moments where you're like I don't even what's,0.05968693
happening right now this is very weird but for some reason it feels right and,0.029239478
it doesn't feel as weird as it probably should I don't know maybe it's just,0.037925445
me maybe I just like weird movies but I really liked it I thought it,0.049726468
was really cool I thought it was a very unique movie it's been a while,0.03131352
since I've seen a movie as unique as this one and I loved the theme,0.042313
behind it I loved all the messages I loved all the acting all the visuals,0.10971539
everything about it was absolutely fantastic because of that I'm going to give it a,0.053554602
4.5 out of 5 I'm knocking down at point five because there were parts that,0.02521179
were a little weird and made me feel kind of uncomfortable I haven't entirely processed,0.04658015
it yet maybe I'll change my mind later there was just a little bit that,0.058933277
I feel could have been turned around or I don't know I don't know poor,0.10964488
bum five out of five that's pretty good I think that's okay so did you,0.23886068
see the shape of water let me know in the comments below what you thought,0.018764166
about it I would love to hear your thoughts thank you guys so much for,0.051750623
