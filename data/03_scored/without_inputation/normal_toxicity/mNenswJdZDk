you know maybe just maybe we've been a little too hard on M night Shyamalan because apparently coming up with endings for thrillers is hard just ask Jordan Peele who in my opinion is now 0 for 2 although I do like his nifty new title a car door opening sequence for monkey paw productions it's so Wes Anderson 8 but back to M night and I suspect by the way we're gonna be seeing a lot of monkey paw productions just like,0.18722461
we've seen a lot of at night,0.057336047
and we used to love M night,0.092965215
remember that the sixth sense with alt was also nominated for a slew of Oscars and Peele just like M night has quickly become a master of coming up with very cool intriguing ideas,0.054113712
what are they differ,0.049966004
though to be honest as the peel leans in heavily to social commentary which makes I think it not only makes you really root for the guy while we rooted for M night,0.09381087
at one point but you know PL seems to be doing,0.06658806
I think in some to some degree is doing so much good that you're not only rooting for him,0.16498455
but it makes a little harder to criticize but I do it with love,0.08723692
and I have a lot of good stuff to say here too,0.065994084
so I hope that it washes out and it's constructive criticism,0.06180432
I believe I feel like the ghosts of Hollywood future if these shadows remain unchanged,0.05698004
this is the future I see for you Jordan Peele learned how to write a third act,0.16449769
alright so anyway on the one hand when it comes to opportunities for black actors and representation for black audiences,0.31242278
peel is doing truly extraordinary work it really is cool to say it's like yeah I'm so happy and it's good,0.08166759
it's really good work which we'll discuss,0.05432953
however peel has admitted that us the movie is a Rorschach test like that teaser,0.096057355
posters you might recall and he intentionally has no clear answers or message for his audience,0.07542708
some of you might be like,0.10054676
oh,0.046070345
I love that,0.046685506
but here's the thing if you're if you're gonna have if you're gonna be really loose on the message,0.11689511
and maybe some of the answers then your narrative has to be stronger,0.2534678
in terms structurally right,0.05155433
you got to have got to have something that's sturdy and I feel the last half of this movie is just all over the place,0.10120262
but anyway this isn't a spoiler review so it's it's hard it's gonna be hard for you to believe this especially as you watch the first half of the movie which is,0.07410004
so freakin amazing you'll be like how could this go wrong and then you'll be like oh yeah I see what you're talking about now,0.5154597
it's kind of shocking how little answers you get you're like you're not gonna really explain any of it alright,0.32053277
so Pele has put out there that he has given some thought while making this movie to the duality of the black experience,0.31089434
his words are not mine in America,0.2254721
I think that that's I don't really see that reflected anywhere in the movie I think he's just kind of pushing the mentality of people who are seeing it in that direction being like you're like,0.2030723
what is this about Jordan,0.06498363
he's like you know,0.14343531
what it might be about,0.06546756
and I'm like make a commitment,0.083987325
I think non-committal I think it's a very good way to describe this movie in terms of what it's what it's about right,0.14927156
because as I said that's barely represented in the script beyond the central conceit,0.078224555
that's what I get for trying to use a big vocabulary word the central idea of people discovering that they have duplicates right,0.114421934
in fact if this was truly a movie about duality including the black experience in America and even beyond that because I think duality is a concept that everyone can relate to and everyone would want to confront right then that would permeate every aspect of the characters,0.102786504
and the story,0.03223625
that's how you make a movie about duality,0.071311004
and this is not that a bottom line as I said Pele puts together a first half of a movie that's pretty much perfect,0.15758032
and then the thing just starts to unravel significantly and quite quickly until it just stops with a non ending like movies over and you're like really,0.08344494
hmm,0.0537797
I think whether or not you love us and some people love it to be fair depends on two things,0.08844338
one,0.052165557
you don't see the other end,0.12877695
twists coming,0.055444974
I figured it out about 15 minutes into the movie,0.07905223
so the big reveal couldn't distract me from the third act problems,0.10960905
and I suspect it well for many others,0.079610586
and two if you can successfully project your own social commentary of choice under the moon then you're gonna obviously be like,0.086381614
I love this movie it represents everything that I wanted to represent because Jordan Peele just made a really loose construct for you to do with what you will,0.15295407
but again as I said to me,0.06289937
I think the film is just so non-committal,0.08262689
I don't really feel,0.08575694
you can reward a film for being,0.074683174
so likes,0.051463466
so non-committal like it's not a it's like I almost feel like,0.11117332
it's refusing to take a stand rather than being a tool for you to use,0.14472035
it's like you can do that,0.10260441
I don't think,0.102524914
so I don't see how it can have a message,0.06274919
if there's really just nothing there to build on,0.06626804
I mean it's it requires so much projection the message is entirely personally generated,0.057892743
and I guess you know that is a valid form of art,0.08729264
one could say like abstract art,0.089647
but uh it's it's not very rewarding in my opinion as if it's a piece of entertainment we'll talk about the entertainment value of the movie in just a moment,0.112157874
but one other thing I want to add is that I thought the film for the first half of it was really progressive in that Lupita Nyong'o gets to play a Toni Collette hereditary type role and Winston Duke gets to play and both of them do it quite well Winston Duke is like a Clark Griswold type dad,0.09281606
I thought that was so wonderful,0.072353266
so if us though it turns out is going to be more about you know race politics right and Nyong'o and Duke in these roles is more a commentary than them legitimately just getting these roles and acing them,0.1807452
well I mean it's like are they,0.07528111
actually I guess what I'm trying to say it's like are they actually just playing,0.11040938
these characters is it that kind of cool opportunity for them or they like what you know black actors ironically playing these roles,0.31089434
I don't like that I don't like the latter,0.15965773
I think the former to me is really exciting,0.04274332
and the latter is like I think arguably less progressive but okay,0.1523971
so all this aside,0.14253268
how was the movie as a piece of entertainment,0.16044754
well I think it's wildly entertaining for the first half as I said perfect and well peel his writing needs some work some he might be like god damn it grace peel us an Oscar,0.6831993
he's very good at coming up with an idea as I said at the beginning of this review and also don't forget the Oscars are very political,0.08810454
and they sometimes you know democratically dole out awards to different films and really the best the best Oscar forget out to receive was for writing and it allowed the Academy to give Jordan peel something for his work,0.04445434
even though he just could not win in other categories,0.08632478
because again the politics of it all but I think his writing needs some work but damn has he quickly evolved into a master director,0.7060492
the opening sequence of us has to be seen,0.06004668
the opening scene is so good that it races the entire film up to such a high degree that it carries the entire rest of it even the third act you're like yeah this is not great,0.19506082
but I just I still have that opening in my mind,0.06888316
it was so good,0.07090163
I'll tell you how good it was when I went to film school I had this professor who taught us filmmaking by just having us watch sequences from Spielberg's jaws again,0.05524671
and again this sequence is that good so one,0.06309597
I can't wait to see it again,0.10559961
I don't know I didn't even as you can see I have major problems with the film and I'm excited to see it again,0.07136543
I don't have my tickets then all the way through the Wilsons leaving their neighbors home about halfway through again the movie is shockingly,0.14587153
good like in terms of the shining when it comes to being well constructed,0.043155394
I love by the way that Jordan Peele has been walking around doing interviews,0.16368683
dressed as Jack Torrance from the shining and intentionally,0.07121012
it's so smart he loves Easter eggs this movie has tons of Easter eggs,0.31089434
in it and that and then in that regard it's a little bit like scream,0.19059041
and then it's very clever and meta both in terms of pop culture but I also really liked that it had a lot of nods to african-american history and culture which I thought was a really nice touch again,0.14947592
it's not really a message,0.0706224
but it's again really cool Easter eggs,0.25922954
and I think gives the film I think not only a level of authenticity,0.15549323
but I felt like legitimacy again they are not ironically playing these roles,0.102650076
it's really about this really nice family,0.07192436
and this is the types of things they would have in their home like for instance like from a Howard sweatshirt to Alvin Ailey Dance posters,0.05537095
I thought that was great,0.0765067
the movie is also terrifying so scary,0.15004215
I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to scary movies as you know,0.4932588
but I hit my eyes a lot and the idea of being attacked by yourself is truly disturbing like you kind of get an idea in the trailers,0.46578255
but trust me you have no real idea of how disturbing it is until you see this movie and it's heightened by the entire casts fantastic ability to hypnotically play to very different sides of the same coin,0.15155393
I was like wow you really are like very different,0.11214009
I love it,0.06814149
and while everyone in the cast does a great job,0.07363807
this is truly Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Dukes film their performances are truly captivating funny and charming and they both come across like true movie stars I love it,0.0867564
I also love the Wilson family as a whole and their likability relatability and spunk you'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie I think helps to soften the blow as the film or disappointment,0.2412274
let's say as the film begins to unravel you're like ah but at least,0.08075454
I'm still with the Wilson,0.035182156
so what a cool family and we'll talk about all that the unraveling and the spoiler review but as I tweeted earlier today despite being deeply flawed,0.065941095
I feel that the first half of us is so good that it truly is a must st.,0.13382584
so that's my review of us,0.0745222
