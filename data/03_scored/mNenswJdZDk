you know maybe just maybe we've been a little too hard on M night Shyamalan,0.15700752
because apparently coming up with endings for thrillers is hard just ask Jordan Peele who,0.08929807
in my opinion is now 0 for 2 although I do like his nifty new,0.10038002
title a car door opening sequence for monkey paw productions it's so Wes Anderson 8,0.17757954
but back to M night and I suspect by the way we're gonna be seeing,0.06915198
a lot of monkey paw productions just like we've seen a lot of at night,0.31053615
and we used to love M night remember that the sixth sense with alt was,0.05600197
also nominated for a slew of Oscars and Peele just like M night has quickly,0.14861453
become a master of coming up with very cool intriguing ideas what are they differ,0.0557731
though to be honest as the peel leans in heavily to social commentary which makes,0.036966465
I think it not only makes you really root for the guy while we rooted,0.27316883
for M night at one point but you know PL seems to be doing I,0.07823184
think in some to some degree is doing so much good that you're not only,0.22892669
rooting for him but it makes a little harder to criticize but I do it,0.08554846
with love and I have a lot of good stuff to say here too so,0.054334104
I hope that it washes out and it's constructive criticism I believe I feel like,0.061415233
the ghosts of Hollywood future if these shadows remain unchanged this is the future I,0.06360701
see for you Jordan Peele learned how to write a third act alright so anyway,0.17427085
on the one hand when it comes to opportunities for black actors and representation for,0.11619299
black audiences peel is doing truly extraordinary work it really is cool to say it's,0.25519666
like yeah I'm so happy and it's good it's really good work which we'll discuss,0.073085204
however peel has admitted that us the movie is a Rorschach test like that teaser,0.096057385
posters you might recall and he intentionally has no clear answers or message for his,0.071988545
audience some of you might be like oh I love that but here's the thing,0.08506017
if you're if you're gonna have if you're gonna be really loose on the message,0.15746212
and maybe some of the answers then your narrative has to be stronger in terms,0.16397043
structurally right you got to have got to have something that's sturdy and I feel,0.10594141
the last half of this movie is just all over the place but anyway this,0.09147888
isn't a spoiler review so it's it's hard it's gonna be hard for you to,0.099221915
believe this especially as you watch the first half of the movie which is so,0.075479954
freakin amazing you'll be like how could this go wrong and then you'll be like,0.6101022
oh yeah I see what you're talking about now it's kind of shocking how little,0.12513092
answers you get you're like you're not gonna really explain any of it alright so,0.2405908
Pele has put out there that he has given some thought while making this movie,0.11103352
to the duality of the black experience his words are not mine in America I,0.47567984
think that that's I don't really see that reflected anywhere in the movie I think,0.0904593
he's just kind of pushing the mentality of people who are seeing it in that,0.20423073
direction being like you're like what is this about Jordan he's like you know what,0.13204111
it might be about and I'm like make a commitment I think non-committal I think,0.10785263
it's a very good way to describe this movie in terms of what it's what,0.10669095
it's about right because as I said that's barely represented in the script beyond the,0.06664044
central conceit that's what I get for trying to use a big vocabulary word the,0.08338826
central idea of people discovering that they have duplicates right in fact if this was,0.1026781
truly a movie about duality including the black experience in America and even beyond that,0.15691122
because I think duality is a concept that everyone can relate to and everyone would,0.027667092
want to confront right then that would permeate every aspect of the characters and the,0.045417957
story that's how you make a movie about duality and this is not that a,0.051233266
bottom line as I said Pele puts together a first half of a movie that's,0.13157785
pretty much perfect and then the thing just starts to unravel significantly and quite quickly,0.051213402
until it just stops with a non ending like movies over and you're like really,0.15430582
hmm I think whether or not you love us and some people love it to,0.10483669
be fair depends on two things one you don't see the other end twists coming,0.055605523
I figured it out about 15 minutes into the movie so the big reveal couldn't,0.06288692
distract me from the third act problems and I suspect it well for many others,0.14083542
and two if you can successfully project your own social commentary of choice under the,0.06790993
moon then you're gonna obviously be like I love this movie it represents everything that,0.1536928
I wanted to represent because Jordan Peele just made a really loose construct for you,0.18094516
to do with what you will but again as I said to me I think,0.09352878
the film is just so non-committal I don't really feel you can reward a film,0.096920244
for being so likes so non-committal like it's not a it's like I almost feel,0.2016163
like it's refusing to take a stand rather than being a tool for you to,0.13161208
use it's like you can do that I don't think so I don't see how,0.10543144
it can have a message if there's really just nothing there to build on I,0.058053453
mean it's it requires so much projection the message is entirely personally generated and I,0.041263685
guess you know that is a valid form of art one could say like abstract,0.09400974
art but uh it's it's not very rewarding in my opinion as if it's a,0.10049798
piece of entertainment we'll talk about the entertainment value of the movie in just a,0.07734488
moment but one other thing I want to add is that I thought the film,0.06221995
for the first half of it was really progressive in that Lupita Nyong'o gets to,0.08022177
play a Toni Collette hereditary type role and Winston Duke gets to play and both,0.11160541
of them do it quite well Winston Duke is like a Clark Griswold type dad,0.19326195
I thought that was so wonderful so if us though it turns out is going,0.108818196
to be more about you know race politics right and Nyong'o and Duke in these,0.21438427
roles is more a commentary than them legitimately just getting these roles and acing them,0.14122222
well I mean it's like are they actually I guess what I'm trying to say,0.11562306
it's like are they actually just playing these characters is it that kind of cool,0.06579638
opportunity for them or they like what you know black actors ironically playing these roles,0.40320143
I don't like that I don't like the latter I think the former to me,0.123500116
is really exciting and the latter is like I think arguably less progressive but okay,0.09478456
so all this aside how was the movie as a piece of entertainment well I,0.13244422
think it's wildly entertaining for the first half as I said perfect and well peel,0.12867594
his writing needs some work some he might be like god damn it grace peel,0.7928473
us an Oscar he's very good at coming up with an idea as I said,0.10128187
at the beginning of this review and also don't forget the Oscars are very political,0.06791635
and they sometimes you know democratically dole out awards to different films and really the,0.06652558
best the best Oscar forget out to receive was for writing and it allowed the,0.0394324
Academy to give Jordan peel something for his work even though he just could not,0.054129116
win in other categories because again the politics of it all but I think his,0.096627764
writing needs some work but damn has he quickly evolved into a master director the,0.6954365
opening sequence of us has to be seen the opening scene is so good that,0.057739016
it races the entire film up to such a high degree that it carries the,0.13349208
entire rest of it even the third act you're like yeah this is not great,0.31089434
but I just I still have that opening in my mind it was so good,0.0642038
I'll tell you how good it was when I went to film school I had,0.07379392
this professor who taught us filmmaking by just having us watch sequences from Spielberg's jaws,0.09383591
again and again this sequence is that good so one I can't wait to see,0.07830455
it again I don't know I didn't even as you can see I have major,0.11092496
problems with the film and I'm excited to see it again I don't have my,0.07992032
tickets then all the way through the Wilsons leaving their neighbors home about halfway through,0.08363624
again the movie is shockingly good like in terms of the shining when it comes,0.059912004
to being well constructed I love by the way that Jordan Peele has been walking,0.11419311
around doing interviews dressed as Jack Torrance from the shining and intentionally it's so smart,0.15178847
he loves Easter eggs this movie has tons of Easter eggs in it and that,0.15064417
and then in that regard it's a little bit like scream and then it's very,0.1810438
clever and meta both in terms of pop culture but I also really liked that,0.07014947
it had a lot of nods to african-american history and culture which I thought was,0.13306695
a really nice touch again it's not really a message but it's again really cool,0.08571634
Easter eggs and I think gives the film I think not only a level of,0.24058627
authenticity but I felt like legitimacy again they are not ironically playing these roles it's,0.09029895
really about this really nice family and this is the types of things they would,0.057589527
have in their home like for instance like from a Howard sweatshirt to Alvin Ailey,0.056201853
Dance posters I thought that was great the movie is also terrifying so scary I'm,0.09673847
a bit of a wimp when it comes to scary movies as you know but,0.5560643
I hit my eyes a lot and the idea of being attacked by yourself is,0.52276796
truly disturbing like you kind of get an idea in the trailers but trust me,0.25418845
you have no real idea of how disturbing it is until you see this movie,0.2462119
and it's heightened by the entire casts fantastic ability to hypnotically play to very different,0.07482766
sides of the same coin I was like wow you really are like very different,0.15248829
I love it and while everyone in the cast does a great job this is,0.0928861
truly Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Dukes film their performances are truly captivating funny and charming,0.100285135
and they both come across like true movie stars I love it I also love,0.07617879
the Wilson family as a whole and their likability relatability and spunk you'll know what,0.1622365
I'm talking about when you see the movie I think helps to soften the blow,0.15241213
as the film or disappointment let's say as the film begins to unravel you're like,0.05137085
ah but at least I'm still with the Wilson so what a cool family and,0.027328711
we'll talk about all that the unraveling and the spoiler review but as I tweeted,0.04762499
earlier today despite being deeply flawed I feel that the first half of us is,0.06485455
so good that it truly is a must st. so that's my review of us,0.13712984
