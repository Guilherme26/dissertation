hi everyone its Lissa and this is always in a mashiki the place that encourages,0.10099751
you to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so thor ragnarok stars,0.24093312
Chris Hemsworth Tom Hiddleston Cate Blanchet Tessa Thompson chuckle bloom and Mark Ruffalo and it's,0.08985886
directed by Tycho watt TV and let me say this movie was so much fun,0.12465482
to watch and it was really beautiful it was gorgeous it surprised me with how,0.13680801
incredible the images actually were so I think it is very safe to say that,0.075581364
this third installment absolutely blows the other Thor films out of the water I had,0.15017706
so much more fun watching this so it takes place during the time of Captain,0.06996636
America Civil War and this is when Thor and the Hulk are way from Earth,0.16132435
so this time around the villain is hella who's brilliantly played by Kate Blanchet and,0.2710176
she's taken over Asgard as the goddess of death hella is a formidable adversary as,0.38696164
she's able to destroy it the worst hammer with the least bit of effort much,0.41641122
of the movie is Thor trying to get back to Asgard but he can't do,0.07341896
that before compiling this kind of ragtag group of misfits that can defeat hella and,0.5576632
while that may really sound like guardians of the galaxy I was pleasantly surprised to,0.06512971
find that the tone wasn't exactly the same in these two movies when I think,0.10212335
of guardians I think of Peter quill and how he's a child of the 80s,0.16886632
and it's really sarcastic but it's also a little laid-back in a kind of Motown,0.1505885
vibe whereas this is like a late 70s hard rock space opera and it kind,0.13821565
of reminded me of Shira and he-man two cartoons that I would always watch growing,0.09220754
up in the 80s and so I was happy that the tone wasn't exactly the,0.059185434
same it has its own distinct feeling and much of what makes this work is,0.058580756
that Thor is actually funny and I don't just mean that characters who are surrounding,0.09588287
Thor but I mean Chris Hemsworth is actually funny as Thor so I first realized,0.07023859
that Hemsworth is a funny guy when I saw him in ghostbusters where to me,0.099529415
he was the funniest person in the entire film I feel bad saying that but,0.18646476
I didn't think that was very funny but here he even grows his comedic acting,0.11302803
chops even further and he makes a Thor who is a little bit awkward and,0.38939512
kind of clumsy and a little slightly bit narcissistic I would say uh and I,0.7093121
loved that he was so different in this film from the other ones and they,0.07665209
put him against some really great comedic heavyweights like Jeff Goldblum who is just perfect,0.24017096
in this movie I mean he could not be more perfect as the Grand Master,0.14124216
and the makeup is great my costumes look awesome look awesome and so he gets,0.081123315
to meet the grand master by going to the planets a car won't say how,0.063490056
that happens but it does happen in succour is a place that a lot of,0.29444134
aliens are basically sent so that they can fight in this gladiator style arena and,0.15291506
that's how Thor and the Hulk reunited and so without giving anything more away once,0.058440156
we're brought to Sekar and introduced to the Grand Master the movie definitely takes off,0.059408892
in terms of stories and visuals and then also added to this film is Valkyrie,0.10654557
who's played by Tessa Thompson who once used to be a great warrior but now,0.041673534
is kind of just a drunk but she can still knock out any person that,0.40319413
she meets I will admit that at one point it kind of felt like I,0.11320054
was watching West world because between Tessa Thompson and Anthony Hopkins and then there's another,0.029542418
cameo that I will not name it really did remind me of like oh my,0.09756874
god these are all the characters for my favorite TV show and that's another thing,0.066176206
there are a ton of really fun cameos in this movie that were genuinely so,0.093643524
I had no idea that these people were going to be in the movie so,0.084864154
I'm definitely not going to tell you that right now but these four characters really,0.07581593
do have great interaction with each other and they have a lot of history and,0.079289146
that leads to a lot of funny sequences but I did feel like it never,0.082310356
quite reached that kind of funny but heartfelt tone that Guardians has which is why,0.08286006
I do like guardians better just for that that reason but this movie does boast,0.078519255
one of my favorite villains that I've ever seen in the Marvel Universe I think,0.098165415
Kate Blanchet as hella is just so awesome and evil and funny and she is,0.43222517
this beautiful creature with like these antlers growing out of her and if the costume,0.32849002
was just so so cool and Kate Blanchette to begin with it's just one of,0.059208002
my favorite actresses but she's been given a character where she's really very much involved,0.14209723
in the action and she gets to be in some really cool fight sequences and,0.13429236
she looks amazing while doing it and she's that perfect combination of evil but having,0.4425118
a good bit of fun while being evil and all I know is that I'm,0.31582418
a little bit sad that Halloween just happened because I definitely would have been her,0.24054
character but now I know for sure who I'm going to be for next year,0.024449367
she just looks awesome in the movie and she is awesome in this movie and,0.092248216
I'll also say that the visuals are outstanding and the artistry is certainly different from,0.03679431
other films in the Marvel Universe it's a much more retro looking color scheme of,0.08554675
like red and white turquoise and white green and white basically anything and white as,0.05681836
well as having many scenes with a complimentary color palette so some of the action,0.04781168
sequences at the end reminded me of the cover to like a wolf mother album,0.11148739
which of course is a throwback to the 70s and let's talk about the action,0.059865937
sequences at the end of the movie because they were awesome they were just so,0.048660595
gorgeous walking and sometimes in the Marvel movies I find the action sequences they're great,0.11369925
I love them but sometimes they're a little bit too long but here I found,0.15532523
myself wanting more which is definitely a good thing and there were certain shots that,0.14871672
reminded me a little bit of like Zack Snyder style and 300 or the Amazon,0.10060707
the Amazons and Wonder Woman because Thor comes in like the lightning bolt that he,0.094049454
was born to be on these diagonals and those shots were just so cool in,0.16116261
it it reminded me even more of like album art from the 1970s and it,0.031266645
was just so different from what I'm used to seeing in these type of movies,0.078883626
and that brings me to the soundtrack so first of all they play Led Zeppelin's,0.12543145
the immigrant song twice in the movie and I was in heaven because that's one,0.12431907
of my favorite songs and it just perfectly fits the tone of the movie and,0.076156266
another criticism that I've heard and I agree with about the Marvel movies is that,0.11782406
the music is not very memorable the score is really nothing to write home about,0.08553053
but here the score is very distinct and it's very retro feeling and it fits,0.069900274
the movie perfectly but that's not to say that I felt every single element of,0.08750641
this movie was perfect it was very very good I really really enjoyed it but,0.14480993
some things that I thought they could have worked on the beginning was a little,0.053512383
bit slow in the pacing I thought it could have moved along a little bit,0.27240744
more maybe even am up this stylized aspect because the beginning isn't quite as cemani,0.07788733
stylized as like the middle and the end were and I also felt that while,0.06368917
the chemistry is really great with all the characters it never really achieves that sort,0.08682957
of heartfelt and genuine moment and I just personally I kind of like a mix,0.1058441
of both and Valerie and Thor they're great at hating each other but I thought,0.40310618
that there could have been a bit more chemistry in their love-hate relationship and it,0.15228644
kind of kills me that a Juris elbows character was not in the movie that,0.4203975
uh he's very summer when he's in the film because he has to be that's,0.087648615
who his character is but I really wish that he was a bigger part of,0.08050234
the script he's such a funny guy in real life he's full of life and,0.32972446
vivacity and I feel like he just Alba just would have fit in with this,0.11314132
group so well and so I wish they had attached his character to the group,0.07666024
it really looked like he was part of the group in the trailers but it's,0.07727259
really just the four characters that are part of that group trying to defeat Hellas,0.07705617
so that one part was also a bit disappointing to me but I'm still really,0.15521528
impressed with marble and the fact that they were able to acknowledge that they had,0.052965984
two misfires with the previous Thor movies and they were able to just change the,0.05193557
tone by 180 degrees I had watched like yesterday I think I watched an interview,0.06527866
where Hemsworth was saying that so much of the dialogue was actually improvised and like,0.04186912
I kind of couldn't believe it because I can't believe that such a big studio,0.09423848
would allow for the actors to improvise the dialogue but that's what makes Marvel better,0.092744306
than DC they're just willing to take chances and try different things with their films,0.11827906
and as a result they're making you know in my opinion much better films than,0.103247575
DC and a lot of that has to do with the director with teeny he,0.03850015
is so funny in general and he's just he's a comedian and he plays Korg,0.10134137
in the movie who's this rock alien and he's very funny as that character but,0.18092091
he had done the mockumentary what we do in the shadows which is so quirky,0.15346596
and oddball and different and he applies that same kind of tone of just like,0.22061269
sheer quirkiness to a Marvel movie and it works so well and I'm glad that,0.14674617
Marvel took a shot with a director who's a little bit smaller that never worked,0.29537156
with such a big budget before because taking that risk is definitely paying off in,0.04402277
their work so now for the grades in terms of film and artistry I would,0.04216776
give Thor Ragnarok a B+ I thought it was so much fun it's beautifully shot,0.3490101
I love the color palette of this movie was just a gorgeous to watch it,0.06690981
also boasts Chris Hemsworth's best performance as Thor ever I actually think this was probably,0.07678429
the best performance I've ever seen him give in a movie and it has a,0.07280393
great villain with Cate Blanchet some of the negatives were the fact that it was,0.13370168
a little bit drawn-out in certain parts I thought the pacing could have been a,0.19900344
little bit better and there could have been a bit more in the characterization department,0.11618127
for me so I wouldn't quite say that this movie was as good as guardians,0.15114921
but it's definitely one of the top Marvel movies that I've ever seen and then,0.108604714
in terms of watch ability which is how much I enjoy the movie well there,0.028900355
I would give Thor Ragnarok and a because I really enjoyed watching this movie I,0.12038942
think you could tell by now I've really liked to analyze and deconstruct films but,0.062077265
sometimes every once in a while you just want to watch something that's entertaining but,0.0905203
something that's well made and entertaining and the word Ragnarok definitely fills that void to,0.07767153
me like I said it's not as good as guardians like really just my heart,0.16741897
belongs to that movie but this is one of the best and one more thing,0.08624824
if I were DC I would be a little nervous right now because Marvel has,0.07558662
been consistently hitting it out of the park I thought Joe I thought spider-man homecoming,0.2783884
was just so awesome and this film was so much fun I'm going to see,0.056764714
Justice League next week but I kind of can't imagine a world where Justice League,0.056228366
is actually better than Thor Ragnarok I just I can't see it happening I'm gonna,0.07196551
be really open-minded going into it but I'm just not sure and I also thought,0.09504801
that Thor Ragnarok was better than Wonder Woman which i think is their best DC,0.1697462
movie so you know if this was better than their best DC movie we'll see,0.07806903
about Justice League but I hope it's really good I hope they did a great,0.06566042
job with it but thank you guys so much for watching I appreciate it so,0.04347739
much if you liked the video please like and subscribe leave us comment below I'm,0.08678973
sure so many people are going to be watching this movie so I'd love to,0.1018821
