okay if you just saw Logan and you did not walk out completely blown away,0.31089434
I have one thing to say to you so Logan tells the story of a,0.08763198
way past his prime Wolverine that goes on one final adventure after meeting a very,0.064905174
mysterious young girl this is the tenth x-men movie the third Wolverine Side Story and,0.26190197
the final time that we're gonna see Hugh Jackman portray the character of Logan oh,0.036508124
oh it's so sad to say those words out loud because people this is not,0.08766984
only one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen it's not only the,0.076692894
best x-men movie that's out there this is the best that we've seen Hugh Jackman,0.13442725
be in the role of Logan and Wolverine and it's the last time we're gonna,0.061541148
see it I've just why now the story in Logan is easily the most grounded,0.045989882
the most gritty and the most downscaled story that we have seen in the x-men,0.18528442
film universe yet and it totally works to this film's advantage because that's the tone,0.09718185
that they're going for with the story and the tone of Logan the trying to,0.029607514
go for this gritty grounded tale and that is exactly what you get I really,0.14909565
liked how this story kind of slowly evolved throughout the runtime you start off and,0.09944019
you're getting introduced to this past his prime Wolverine to this dying Professor X and,0.2582146
it really just seems like you're waiting for these characters to perish and then they,0.16934375
get thrown into this situation with this new girl and it becomes a road movie,0.24264489
there's a little bit of the post-apocalyptic flavor in there there's a little bit of,0.0899124
comic-book flavor in there mostly dealing with this group of mercenaries chasing down Logan and,0.23990272
Patrick Stewart and x-23 but really the movie's not even about that struggle it's not,0.06664817
about them trying to escape the villain it's more about Logan facing himself and facing,0.10016226
his mortality and really trying to rediscover his heroism trying to rediscover why he became,0.12748839
Wolverine in the first place why he tried to save so many people throughout this,0.07237038
film franchise why he tries to be the good side of Wolverine and it was,0.056388136
pretty incredible seeing him go through that transformation really it was like they were trying,0.08994554
to get Logan to kind of rediscover himself and get back to where he was,0.15053986
morally and heroically in the beginning so that he could end and that's why this,0.072057955
movie has the perfect title this is not the x-men this is not the Wolverine,0.14018175
this is Logan it's because this movie is about who Logan is underneath all the,0.078213155
blue nlgger underneath all the pain underneath all the larger-than-life stories that he has gone,0.3033916
through in the legend that is the Wolverine who is Logan what is Logan down,0.09930375
to his soul you know when you hear a lot of people talk about amazing,0.10625214
performances in comic book movies you often hear the same names you hear Heath Ledger's,0.08894308
Joker you hear about Robert Downey as Iron Man but you know what Hugh Jackman,0.0772352
beats all of them for his portrayal of Wolverine not only does he just live,0.4438998
and breathe the character of Logan and Wolverine but he's been playing this guy for,0.11797689
17 years and I'm thinking about it and not just just escaping comic book movies,0.087779455
for a bit I can't think of another actor that has dedicated so much to,0.06866997
one singular character like Hugh Jackman has to overing from the first time that we,0.09330702
got to see this guy just in that cage fight when he turns around with,0.32863897
a cigar and just has that animalistic look to him we're just like that's him,0.24075063
and through all the ups and downs this x-men film franchise has been through with,0.107105106
some really great movies and some really shitty movies the one constant in all of,0.76439553
it is Hugh Jackman is always amazing as Logan and what I just saw was,0.07942176
Hugh Jackman take all of the 17 years of experience that he's had with this,0.07813209
character and end it on the highest note possible I'll tell you what people this,0.104179546
is gonna be one of the hardest roles ever to try and recast because like,0.03997244
the old saying says you can't top perfection it's gonna be hard to talk about,0.11250028
anything else in this review guys because what Hugh Jackman just delivered was nothing short,0.09293395
of an amazing performance I mean this guy this is the Wolverine that he has,0.15370059
been wanting to give us from the time he first put on the claws this,0.12264986
is easily the most human that we've seen Wolverine he's facing his own mortality he's,0.11051403
facing living a life where he just constantly sees all of his loved ones die,0.51631576
around him and he just out lives everybody and he's facing himself in this movie,0.31089434
just as much as he's facing the outside influences and the villains in the story,0.061684605
it's also the most insane that we've seen Hugh Jackman's Wolverine to words people berserker,0.34730342
rage I was not prepared for how bloody and violent this movie was gonna be,0.53515136
for those of you that wanted to raid a tower Wolverine you got it Logan,0.2121747
went way beyond just seeing Wolverine stabbed a bunch of guys with his claws you,0.58327645
could limbs taken off people get decapitated you see so much carnage in this it's,0.5876557
wonderful granted it's not something you need to see with every single comic book character,0.11772958
but this does really excite me for what doors this movie might open for some,0.35648596
rated-r comic book movies going forward but as much as I'd love to talk about,0.11348334
Hugh Jackman for another 25 minutes there's another actor that we are saying goodbye to,0.06601853
in a beloved role this is Patrick Stewart's final performance as Professor X we get,0.09048367
to see a much different shade of his version of Professor X in this movie,0.12193184
you know there's a very different style between James McAvoy Professor X and Patrick Stewart,0.08782388
Professor X and the Patrick Stewart Professor X that we get to see in Logan,0.07696915
is like a third shade he's a much more grounded a much more greedy and,0.40329456
realistic version of Professor X he's weathered he's been through some nlgger just like Logan,0.4420471
has Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have always had great chemistry with each other in,0.06534884
these movies but it was firing on all cylinders in this the humor is great,0.29908
back and forth there's a lot of really really gut punch emotional moments in this,0.23386492
between those two characters and it's a really bittersweet send-off for both of them because,0.10745717
you've been with both of them for almost 17 years and it just feels like,0.06915345
a fitting way to end both of those characters and to send-off both of those,0.13239653
actors portrayals with each other now the new character that were introduced to in this,0.07082634
movie is x-23 played by Daphne Keene and you know what in a movie where,0.0576846
it's really built on not only nostalgia and not only this bittersweet send-off for these,0.14733322
two actors that we've been with for so long and we're really focusing on them,0.13036317
I was focusing just as much on x-23 she was a great character not only,0.11317076
was she just as badass as Wolverine but from the second she walks onto the,0.31089434
screen you're interested in her you're intrigued by her you like her you think she's,0.18444747
cool and you really want to see what's gonna go on between her and Wolverine,0.15148354
and Professor X and that says a lot about this little girl's performance because for,0.25311232
the first two-thirds of this movie she doesn't even say a word I don't know,0.23975368
if we're gonna get to see more of X 23 I don't know she's gonna,0.0959718
continue on in this franchise she's gonna be part of the New Mutants or we're,0.16933975
gonna see her in some further x-men apology movies but I love her character and,0.10021686
I want to see more of her and she fits right in with Hugh Jackman,0.1825652
and Patrick Stewart without missing a single beat she has the chemist with those two,0.0883473
almost like she's been around since beginning of this franchise now the villains in this,0.1536587
movie are a group of mercenaries called Reavers their leader is called Donald Pierce and,0.3642365
he's played by Boyd Holbrook and he's a really cool villain he's not really like,0.15253977
this big larger-than-life villain that were used to seeing on the x-men franchise he's not,0.24248397
a mutant he's not somebody who has like all these powers in this grand world-ending,0.25255254
scheme he's just a small little villain that works for the small movie and the,0.19441089
way that his villain is used is much more close to what the MCU does,0.18438424
with their villains where it's more of a plot device that's used to propel the,0.1532642
story forward you're not really supposed to focus too much on the villain he's not,0.13350964
supposed to overtake the heroes and they executed that really well in this because he's,0.34559315
not really somebody that you're gonna walk away thinking man he was such a badass,0.5891308
villain but he was used really well to propel the story to where it needed,0.15328456
to go for Logan Professor X and x-23 and Boyd Homburg does really good in,0.08296611
the role now aside from all the great performances and characters that we've got in,0.050700627
this movie the other biggest star of Logan is James mangled now this guy has,0.15035425
directed some damn good movies in his lifetime he directed cop Lane was Sylvester Stallone,0.6364068
really really underrated cop movie he directed 3:10 to Yuma the remake with Russell Crowe,0.08726487
and Christian Bale one of the best westerns that I've seen in a long time,0.14860366
I really enjoyed his previous x-men movie The Wolverine even though the third act kind,0.21603629
of fell apart but really his direction in this movie as flawless as it is,0.11177019
makes me really wonder what we would have gotten out of the Wolverine had he,0.14861915
had the gloves taken off and was able to make the movie he wanted to,0.08173799
make which is clearly what he did with Logan because not only did he direct,0.111355565
this movie but he came up with a score story of the movie and he,0.093388356
also co-write the script with two other people so this was really James Mangold's brainchild,0.09538006
and what I appreciated the most about his direction in this movie aside from the,0.070972815
amazing action scenes aside from getting some of the best performances that we've seen in,0.056220405
a long time and especially in this franchise but he uses a lot of really,0.06610386
really subtle details and his filmmaking in this movie which I love there's a lot,0.12596552
of subtext there's a lot of little minding details that aren't really shoved in your,0.17959712
face they give you just enough information just a little bit of a nugget to,0.32021892
give you an idea and they let you fill in the rest of the blanks,0.10864171
yourself and I love movies that do that because too often nowadays we get movies,0.1452914
where they just feel like they have to over explain everything and I really like,0.04183101
how he set this story in a dystopian future that doesn't go to over the,0.0684268
top with a dystopian thing it's not really like a big post-apocalyptic world like Mad,0.34702635
Max fury road it's not super futuristic it feels like modern times for the most,0.09168817
part but there's just subtle little things thrown in there like these little automatic semi,0.18800527
trucks that go down the road that's futuristic and the fact that mutants aren't around,0.13646252
anymore this has taken place at a time where mutants are all but dead some,0.27279928
kind of event happened that wiped out almost all of the mutants and another one,0.19256532
of those so details I was talking about they don't tell you exactly what happened,0.09405527
they give you enough a little bit of information throughout the movie to kind of,0.10990693
figure it out for yourself or come up with some kind of an idea yourself,0.15427114
and that's all you need we don't need it to be spelled out for us,0.09616597
and I'm glad they didn't above all else one thing that James Mangold really nailed,0.1747331
in this movie is the pacing because not only is this some of the best,0.084515944
pacing that I've seen in a comic-book movie it's some of the best pacing I've,0.08147406
seen in a movie in a long time it opens up with this awesome scene,0.07774793
that just grabs you by the throat lets you know what kind of a Logan,0.52037066
movie you're in for and you were just along for the ride and you have,0.16851044
some great action scenes you got some really emotional moments and the movie just continuously,0.07998475
rejuvenates its energy throughout the runtime of this movie it just rejuvenates the audience's interest,0.14552422
in this story in these characters all the while maintaining the fact that it is,0.043987036
a very grounded and greedy story and not one point in this movie does it,0.17324147
jump the shark and go off into the stupid territory like the last 15 minutes,0.8785311
of the Wolverine Logan stays on course from the time it starts to the time,0.051247027
the credits roll and when those credits roll people I don't care what kind of,0.12446287
preparation you went through what kind of counseling and what kind of group therapy you,0.120342
had before you walked into Logan when that title screen comes on and the credits,0.054759458
roll and you realize this is the last time you're going to see Hugh Jackman's,0.09088241
Wolverine this is the last time you're gonna see Patrick Stewart's Professor X you're gonna,0.15099707
shed some tears so on that note to wrap all this up guys Logan is,0.12896846
not only one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen it's one of,0.08148707
the best movies that I've ever seen this is not your typical comic book movie,0.18923727
it almost seems like it's doing the movie a bit of a disservice to put,0.31089434
it in comic book movie genre because this is something entirely different this is the,0.07648113
best performance you're gonna see from Hugh Jackman in his long 17-year reign as Wolverine,0.16560349
this is the best performance you're gonna see from Patrick Stewart in his long 17-year,0.07791061
reign as Professor X we got a great new character in x-23 who I'm really,0.12874939
crossing my fingers we get to see going forward and the further x-men movies because,0.10619662
she was badass and above anything else it's just really great to walk into a,0.53490317
movie with this big sense of finality and these characters that you have spent almost,0.08745472
17 years with and you not only walk away satisfied but you walk away completely,0.08599759
enthralled so grab some popcorn some drinks and a box of tissues and be prepared,0.14931273
to be amazed by the incredible movie that is Logan and once you're done checking,0.05077947
it out in theaters definitely go out and buy it so what did you guys,0.08010812

best complet movie that you've seen in a long time or were you disappointed in,0.22255193
