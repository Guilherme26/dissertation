well greetings and salutations everybody welcome to my movie vlog my name is John Campea,0.11919954
and this is my review for the brand-new Guillermo del Toro movie the shape of water,0.077885024
I'm not quite sure what the shape of water is but it's a damn good movie,0.4443039
I'll tell you that there,0.04614
I just spoiled the lead for it,0.15348
I love this film I really enjoy this movie we're gonna talk about a little bit here,0.17769471
now I'm actually doing this little video live because what I found is quite,0.117813006
often when I do movie review sometimes people will then ask questions of things,0.14314817
I didn't cover in the review,0.046594124
so I thought you know what why not do this live,0.2575591
and let you guys ask me questions that you have about the movie once I give my a little bit of a review for it,0.16657804
so we're gonna do that in just a second but right now let's get into the movie the shape of water follows,0.05897211
the character played by Sally Hawkins whose name is Eliza in the film now it's kind of really funny and odd for me because this is the same woman who played the mom in Paddington such a wholesome great little fun movie and fun character and let me tell you something folks the shape of water is not a family film,0.09549537
no way,0.06519103
no how it is not a family film,0.09114699
and I remember when I was watching one preview for it it said the following movie contains graphic sexuality and nudity I'm winning and like wait wait wait what this movie's gonna have that I mean surely it's just gonna be rated R because it's gonna have some like really creepy graphic stuff it is Guillermo del Toro right and it's gonna have some violence or whatever,0.4296623
but I didn't think that,0.043602217
and yep it does just be prepared when you go in to watch the shape of water,0.05709142
there's some there's nudity and some graphic sexuality and things like that in there too which I thought just added to the film to be honest with you,0.51814044
but just give you a heads up again,0.34927437
though it was kind of jarring for me at first thinking but this is the mom from Paddington come on,0.10016421
but no really she is absolutely magnificent anyway,0.116629586
Eliza plays a mute woman,0.37236175
she's not deaf but so she's mute,0.49072027
so she communicates in sign language and she works as an in janitorial service at this government facility and at night she goes in and cleans up now as you saw in the trailers,0.087040536
what happens is this one government starts to hold or this government agency starts to hold this sure that they found in their facility and of course the creature,0.0933082
No contrary to popular belief even though it is played by Doug Jones it is not AIDS sapien so who is also played by Doug Jones in another gamble del Toro film but this facility starts to house this creature that they have come across and discovered and of course Sally Hawkins as you can see in the trailer starts to befriend the creature,0.10853514
now also starring in the film playing our bad guy is General Zod himself Michael Shannon who is spectacular in this film along with them of course,0.2837771
we also have Octavia Spencer who plays Eliza's best friend at work she's fantastic and the absolutely unbelievable Richard Jennings who is in this film plays her kind of her best friend and the only person in the world she's really really close to they live in adjoining apartments and he's kind of her confidante and she to him and I'm telling you right,0.18789636
now if I had to vote today I would vote for Richard Jennings to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for this movie,0.09946189
he was wonderful in it Sally Hawkins is gonna end up getting a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards,0.07261482
she just is and she absolutely should if she doesn't it's a bit of a snub if she doesn't get a Kadim II award nomination for Best Actress,0.14947551
in this absolutely now you would think by watching the trailers as well and I'm not gonna give any spoilers in this thing here you would think by watching the trailers that this movie is exclusively about you know,0.09666586
it's kind of a monster movie it's a little bit of a Pan's Labyrinth thing where now she's gonna break out the monster blah blah but really the beautiful thing about this movie is that there is so much more to it there is so much heart and so much meaning in everything Guillermo del Toro does in this film that to me really at its heart when you're looking at the characters played by both Sally and Richard and even Octavia and even our villain Michael Shannon when you really look at this film what this movie is really about is about loneliness and about belonging and finding your place preferably with somebody and that kind of theme is echoed through each individual character in the movie and expressed in a different way by each individual character in the movie to the point that I just I was falling in love this story,0.15047723
it's so much,0.06752901
so that the creature that IMDB just refers to as amphibian man that the creature in the film almost doesn't even have to be a creature,0.18139488
it could have just been another guy kind of filling that role,0.14125924
but the airmen of El Toro uses him as a creature to kind of tell this tale from a fairy tale perspective you know what I mean it has great cadence,0.13488661
it has a great pace,0.040954027
it has a great two or three little side storylines that run throughout with various characters in the film as well,0.020586764
but ultimately when it comes down to it,0.08782662
it's about Eliza,0.070772536
this mute girl finding her place in the weirdest of places this and phibian man this creature that they have and that they're holding in the government facility,0.4012001
and again all that you see in the trailers but it's done so well with such heart and such care and such precision in the hands of guillermo del toro I've heard some people say that they believe that this is Del Toro's best film since Pan's Labyrinth I would actually put this on par with Pan's Labyrinth,0.076048985
now I know that that's really high praise,0.051945023
because Pan's Labyrinth is just crazy good but I would honestly put this movie on the same level as Pan's Labyrinth just because it goes,0.2735456
so much more beyond just what you see on the surface,0.081296496
and what you think the movies about just from the trailers and goes into a real human movie about human experience in human emotion that I just found myself completely enthralled with this movie right from the get-go,0.092856236
now I got a few other things to say about this movie but I also want to know if you guys have any specific questions that don't go into spoiler detail,0.13811785
but if you've got any specific questions about the movie or specific observations about the movie you can communicate,0.10030584
those to me right,0.0715131
now in one of two ways and I'll take them from both number one you can hop on super chat,0.16589575
obviously I get to every single super chat,0.1518345
number two you can jump on Twitter and tweet to me at John Candy's just fire just jump on Twitter and fire off a tweet to me at John Campea and let me know if you have any specific questions about this movie and I'll spend the next ten minutes,0.24001662
so taking questions continuing to talk about this film,0.15081456
so go ahead and start sending those out to me,0.15254398
now,0.031218953
now again,0.041201644
I want to talk about a couple of performances here and I'll go back to Michael Shannon Michael Shannon I've always kind of said that one of the best villains or the best kind of villain you can ever have in one of these movies are the villains who do not see themselves as villains,0.21442801
but rather villains who the most dangerous of them are the ones who see themselves as the good guy,0.24261107
and Michael Shannon is definitely one of these types of villains,0.26074314
he thinks he's the good guy,0.07591382
he thinks he's doing the right thing,0.07750111
he thinks he's doing the good thing,0.07828591
and ultimately that's what makes him the most diabolical and the most dangerous of any kind of cinematic villain,0.55547035
he seems himself as the good guy,0.08620188
and at times the way del Toro shapes this movie you there are even moments in this film,0.20698889
and this is what makes del Toro,0.04986417
so brilliant,0.07436405
there are moments in this film where you actually find yourself sympathizing a little bit with,0.16051538
the Michael Shannon character again I'm not gonna talk about how or why,0.07251699
because I would be spoilers but there are times that you find yourself sympathizing with him which only adds to the impact that his character plays in the story it's so brilliantly done on that level like absolutely brilliantly done on that level and you're swept up in all of it,0.108225755
okay listen,0.053899854
we've got questions coming in about it,0.10548793
so let me switch over to those,0.08417798
now I'm gonna start off with this one from Alex Gerber let's see Alex rates each individual element was okay but it didn't come together for me,0.07007677
however this movie wasn't my first time getting to give my cinema score,0.10240204
you know you know I'm not totally surprised to hear that Alex because just like Pan's Labyrinth Pan's Labyrinth was a movie that I thought was absolutely breathtakingly brilliant but that movie wasn't for everybody and since I'm seeing a lot of similarities not that this movie's a copycat of that other movie but just thematically because I see a lot of similarities between this film and Pan's Labyrinth,0.10808671
it's not gonna surprise me at all that this movie also will not be for everybody,0.15408906
it's not going to be for everybody,0.06804609
but not everybody is going to get this film not one sorry it's not that if you don't like this film that that mean you don't get it not at all,0.11162016
but what it does mean is that I think this movie isn't going to touch everybody the same way that Pan's Labyrinth did I think this movie is going to impact everybody the same way just like Pan's Labyrinth didn't for everybody,0.08610753
I don't expect this will be for everybody,0.08408288
- and if it doesn't,0.053420383
strike you the right way that doesn't mean there's anything,0.18439092
wrong with you all film is,0.11181127
subjective but for me it worked damn well like it,0.45948514
worked damn well ok next one comes us from Sam,0.57561827
Fisher and Sam Fisher,0.035752423
writes I love this movie I think it's Del Toro's best movie since Pan's Labyrinth I called Doug Jones at the Andy Serkis of practical creatures and yeah Doug Jones has made a complete career out of being in gambrel del Toro's movies but also being these practical effects creatures and actually you can currently see Doug Jones in that new,0.096553415
Star Trek show Star,0.0608429
Trek,0.039795574
oh why am I forgetting the name of it Explorer a Star Trek whatever he's in the new Star Trek series on CBS,0.08487901
he plays like this alien captain,0.26331148
and he's brilliant in it he's absolutely fantastic in it,0.15061238
so yes I completely agree all right next one the next question comes to us from John Carr EP who writes how is the CGI okay I'll say this this is what I'll say about the CGI the CGI is so good that I couldn't tell you when it was CGI,0.05628331
and when it wasn't I mean there are a few little moments I could do that looks like it's something composited but it's some minor little details,0.10003399
but overall,0.052775856
I don't know how much this is the biggest compliment,0.17992543
I can give to the CG in this movie I can't tell you how much CG was in it,0.10409442
I even I somebody who worked in the CGI industry for a while I'm looking at this movie and I couldn't tell you if that's visual effects or that's visual effects or not or just practical,0.055774286
and that is the biggest compliment I can give it,0.06448876
so I don't know if del Toro used hardly any CGI if we used a modest amount of CGI but there are very very few moments in this movie that I can even think of that I even thought was CGI,0.06630015
and that's how good the effects in this thing actually ended up being Sam Fisher's writing do you think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination no no,0.053907335
I don't think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination for this mostly because well for a lot of reasons but a lot because I mean he doesn't that may be considered,0.051993594
I won't say that let's say this there are an awful lot of very good Best Supporting Actor nominees this year,0.116460375
so no I don't see him nabbing one of those,0.14183843
he's he's great as a creature absolutely he plays the part wonderfully but no I don't see him getting an Academy Award nomination for this,0.12930343
let's see RC is writing,0.048281614
in is this a more graphic Beauty,0.15116903
and the Beast,0.27926794
ooh that's a you know,0.09082207
what RC,0.048855785
I have not thought of the movie in those terms,0.059656646
but uh you're not she not far off this theme,0.3225492
Attica Lee at least at any rate you will see some similarities between Beauty and the Beast it is a more graphic version of that I wouldn't say it's a Beauty,0.09945843
and the Beast story but there are certainly similarities and nobody can blame you if you came out of it drawing some parallels,0.16571411
but overall I mean it's certainly,0.07261688
these are two very very different movies they are very very different movies but it's not far off the way you're drawing those similarities,0.0930801
so yeah I think you could say that you wouldn't be completely wrong to say this is a more graphic kind of beauty in the beast but it's certainly one is not completely connected to the other Alex Gerber right wrote in again I meant to say was my first time with CinemaScore know I get what you're saying,0.15030521
don't worry I understand what you're saying Alex don't worry about it,0.11268218
the uzi 4:08 says I don't know why you decided to waste your money to tell us a joke but writes in a joke,0.3253235
what do you call it when Batman skips Church Christian Bale huh love what you do,0.20006202
thank you,0.039406788
so much,0.053568453
the Uzi for it I appreciate that as well alright,0.07765851
so let me jump over then now to Twitter and see what some people are saying in Twitter we will start off with Lesley 22800 in an Oscar absolutely it's good at this movie is going to get nominated in some of the big categories,0.15016785
you're going to see Sally Hawkins get nominated for Best Actress,0.08442132
you're I believe you're gonna see Guillermo del Toro nominated for Best Director and I believe very strongly you're gonna see the shape of water getting native for best picture,0.05057863
so there's gonna be a big Oscar presence for this,0.0808148
how many it will win who knows we're not really sure how many words it will actually win but it's going to be a very very big presence,0.096792705
let's see this one comes us from,0.055376656
Stephen,0.038790658
thanks sixteen says is the shape of water as darkest pans or lighter in the story there are very different films from each other,0.065387905
and both have very dark elements in their own way,0.058274165
if I had to just give us plain and simple thing,0.10346059
I guess I would say that the shape of water is a little lighter,0.05937643
I guess I would say that it feels weird saying that but I suppose you could say if one you had to say was a little bit darker than the other I would say Pan's Labyrinth is probably just a little bit darker than the shape of water is but I mean they're both have some very dark elements and both have some lighter very emotional heartfelt elements as well but I'll say the slightly darker one will go over two,0.11089078
we will go over to say Pan's Labyrinth is slightly darker this next one comes to us from homes or Simpson who writes John this movie really shows hollywood's double standard we see tons of female out Anatomy but no fish Anatomy double standard in Hollywood put more efficient atomy on the screen,0.11398551
thanks a lot for the comment,0.052760486
let's see this next one comes to us from T Olli reviews who writes John do you think shape of water can get an Oscar nomination and do you think it's deserved,0.0783898
well,0.03925401
as I just mentioned in the previous question I do,0.027036855
I think it's going to get several of the major categories,0.09882123
it's going to get nominated a couple of the major categories and probably a couple like makeup costuming some other categories like that I could see the shape of water picking up minimum,0.06415672
5 nominations minimum 5 maybe even more we'll have to see now,0.034837846
I don't think,0.102524914
it's a shoo-in to win necessarily any of them but I'm thinking we're gonna get at least 5 of these things we go over to this one this one comes us from Walter who writes John which is better the last gen a or the shape of water,0.09206307
well the last gen I review embargo lifts tomorrow at 9,0.114351936

I'm kind of used in the shape of water review as a little bit of a test run actually for the Star Wars one but I'm gonna do it live at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,0.061926212
so I cannot tell you anything about comparisons to this movie to that because there's a review embargo I want to make sure I don't break that embargo all right,0.1284992

it's fantastic,0.08253775
and thank you so much for the compliment,0.055053353
I appreciate that Sam Fisher is writing it out,0.059751578
the name of the show that you can see Doug Jones in who plays the amphibious creature in this movie is Star,0.17134506
Trek discovery,0.062691525
he plays first officer sir ooh that's how he plays,0.07293488
I think sometimes he's practical sometimes he's a little bit CG,0.22074798
I'm not really sure this is a good,0.08009467
there's a good wrap up there to be had so anyway guys that will do it for my review of the shape of water,0.10031591
