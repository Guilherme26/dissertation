of my viewers are interested in getting a film degree I'm gonna be having a,0.029594686
discussion about that at the end of this video when it comes to Thor Ragnarok,0.045942903
this film does for Thor what Captain America the Winter Soldier did for cap because,0.036226567
before Winter Soldier cap was cool and he was you know he's cool Captain America,0.048150647
but that movie was like oh my god Captain America is just incredible this film,0.09979484
is exactly what Thor needed he needed a major boost of fun and likability and,0.009174878
a great sense of freshness what's so great about Ragnarok is that it takes everything,0.037612144
we know everything that's been established about Thor and it dismantles it his hammer forget,0.043833606
about it it's gone his macho sense of right and wrong played for comedy but,0.06771104
it also keeps the heart of his character intact the family dynamics the struggle with,0.012998354
his brother and his father and now a new thing that he has to deal,0.04644911
with in hella played excellently by Kate Blanchet by the way everyone in this movie,0.06610728
steals the movie there was not one specific character that stole the film for me,0.122527495
because everyone was doing such a great job that they all stole the movie Tessa,0.09980216
Thompson Jeff Goldblum Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth even Taika Waititi as Korg they're all fantastic,0.05123444
this is one of my favorite Marvel movies this is everything I want to see,0.08586323
in a superhero movie it's extremely fun and likable when the action scenes are there,0.026085177
they're like adrenalin fuel they're extremely badass and beautifully shot this is a very colorful,0.24637851
movie which is something I was happy to see because the other Thor movies I'm,0.02651821
fine with them they're enjoyable you can watch them but they were easily some of,0.024744166
the weakest of all the MCU films this is without a doubt easily the best,0.04568348
of the Thor franchise and one of my favorite Marvel movies one of the biggest,0.05742065
issues that I had with the MC use treatment of Thor was that it seemed,0.017582798
I can't confirm this but it seemed like the creator's didn't think audiences would appreciate,0.012554011
such an obscure character unless they brought him quite literally down to earth and put,0.12580352
him in earth and gave him human friends on earth like Jane and Darcy these,0.07155314
are not the things I want to see in a Thor movie and you don't,0.037427224
have to have a strange godlike character around us in New York to be the,0.023849495
likable for us this movie understands that and it's an adventure movie he goes all,0.05500071
over the place and fights different beings of all different kinds but you care because,0.06989417
he feels like a person and it's because of great writing and great acting according,0.035695083
to Taika Waititi he has said that 80% of this movie was improvised that's astounding,0.046378598
because so much of it feels very well created and controlled in regards to the,0.023970557
humor it's so well timed and some might have an issue with this this is,0.021884542
an extremely funny movie and quite often rather than having a very serious moment it,0.030663636
will be played for a joke and that's one of the best things about this,0.043340042
film I believe this is the 17th MCU movie at some point this series is,0.016496554
going to have to acknowledge and be very self-aware of itself and make fun of,0.102629855
itself and Ragnarok does that something else I loved was that they actually have the,0.039471332
immigrant song in the movie it wasn't just for the trailer so often you hear,0.050088994
songs and trailers and you begin to attach that with your anticipation for the movie,0.03387514
and then it's nowhere to be heard in the movie I was so glad they,0.03479642
actually had it incorporated in some really badass moments in the film there were moments,0.08367944
of action here then where I got chills like it gave me goosebumps it was,0.0820065
so exciting you actually get to see Thor being the god of thunder not just,0.031000884
calling down some lightning bolts with his hammer they get rid of so many of,0.28635755
the things that we're used to seeing in a Thor movie that it became very,0.0146806035
surprising consistently because you go to a Thor film at this point expecting to see,0.040086627
certain things you go to an MCU movie at this point expecting to see certain,0.02330604
things this film constantly sidestepped those expectations that we go into these types of movies,0.124972045
with to create a really fresh experience and that is due to excellent writing and,0.011361336
great directing and I have to give it the Taika Waititi because in fairly 80%,0.031906866
of this movie was improvised that's a lot of him going back and forth with,0.02564017
the actors creating something that's really cool it's just so rare that I find movies,0.030630376
where I'm consistently smiling I'm wrapped up in the movie and I'm forgetting that I'm,0.01825929
watching one because it's just so investing and just such a damn good time these,0.28584802
movies aren't made as much as you would think often times you see a movie,0.03904894
like yeah that was kind of fun but it was just diverting this is a,0.046741124
movie that is so enjoyable to experience that I just forgot I was watching one,0.04135114
after a while and I was excited to see what would happen next and that's,0.055159025
one of the beauties of seeing a great film when you realize that you just,0.051109385
wrapped up in it and it's so rare it's so rare when you really think,0.04895286
about it that that happens and and ragnar√∂k did that for me I'm a huge,0.12191951
Planet Hulk fan it's easily my favorite of any of the Hulk comics so I,0.018299202
was really happy to see a lot of that incorporated into this movie quite more,0.0298275
of it than I expected which really brought a smile to my face so if,0.054577652
you are a fan of Planet Hulk like me you're gonna have a blast with,0.08248077
a lot here Jeff Goldblum as the Grand Master is everything I wanted I don't,0.024533968
care that he's basically being like the personification of our thoughts of who Jeff Goldblum,0.087568104
is that's fine with me I'll watch him go uh-huh yes like any day all,0.10030637
the time I don't care it's perfect as for issues with the movie yes there,0.029187594
are a lot of jokes and sometimes there may have been just a few too,0.02778073
many and it's not because there's too many jokes it's more about where to put,0.03976468
them and how to incorporate more serious scenes with the levity honestly 90% of time,0.10897038
it's flawless there were just a few times where I had laughed so much that,0.052075233
the humor came so much more and I was like okay I just laughed I,0.07048086
need give me a second to to process and that's really it's just like a,0.031325493
minor thing you know it's something you don't really care about it doesn't really affect,0.022986086
for me anyway the experience of this movie but I'm mentioning it because I thought,0.029923286
of it also hella well great I thought Blanchette was phenomenal sometimes her character can,0.048710067
be a real exposition Pease she will show art on the ceiling explaining her backstory,0.031715292
she'll be talking a lot to Carl Urban's character saying you don't notice about me,0.029710427
but this is kind of like what happened but she's really telling the audience because,0.033555187
her character comes with so much backstory and they really have to address a lot,0.025991386
of it but again honestly this isn't really anything that bothered me it's just something,0.036867138
that I feel like some people may notice from a screenwriting perspective these flaws are,0.019975465
so minimal that I just I had a blast this is a really fun movie,0.046325386
it's a great superhero movie easily the best Thor movie I'm gonna give thor ragnarok,0.037977993
