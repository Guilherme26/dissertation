in many ways Star Wars the last Jedi is the perfect Star Wars movie not,0.060648393
just from a fan's perspective but also from Disney's because it becomes crystal clear that,0.029918905
this franchise is never going anywhere literally so much happens and yet nothing happens there,0.052405365
are so many deaths and yet nobody dies basically at the end of the movie,0.1910105
you realize for as much fun as you had watching it although I don't know,0.18060625
if everybody's gonna have that experience we'll get to that but even I who loved,0.05235528
every minute of it well almost every minute of it but still I even had,0.06738093
to realize that we were at the exact same place that we were when the,0.056570474
movie started and that's unfortunate or is it if these movies keep making so much,0.11340052
money I mean to be honest I predict that casual fans will fall away because,0.1070471
of the episodic nature that's taking over get it episode 8 of infinity episodes but,0.068254046
there are so many Star Wars fans from hardcore to casual that I think it,0.07298588
will continue to do very healthy business anyway I mean I'll keep watching them if,0.09424848
they're this good so on that note what exactly did I love about the movie,0.06034416
alright so it's a long list yay first the movie is very much a Saturday,0.063079156
morning cartoon like it took me a couple of moments to understand the tone I,0.15286367
was like what are you doing you're crazy like general Hux this is a non-spoiler,0.7093121
review so I can't give anything away but let's just say the movie starts with,0.05640313
general Hux and at first I was like this is horrible but then I realized,0.15888916
what they were doing and I was like this is fabulous accepting what the franchise,0.06309184
is but they're turning the episodes into not the spin-off movies but the episodes once,0.06401157
you accept that it's a lot of fun right so next up boy is this,0.109908715
movie funny it's surprisingly funny remember in the force awakens when the stormtroopers were walking,0.07523794
down the hall and they saw that kylo Ren was throwing a temper tantrum and,0.1122139
they turned around and walked way more of that but just so much more of,0.055602357
that and I loved it like Undercover Boss kind of humor to some degree and,0.10174664
by that I mean not just clever but almost in some ways self-aware what you,0.3067708
I loved I don't know how all Star Wars fans or other people are gonna,0.14016017
feel about it but it was perfect for me but also by extension there's a,0.0863471
very strong focus on average joes that populate this world and I love me some,0.08139717
average Joe moments they're my favorite thing and more than anything they make me feel,0.10282781
like I could be a part of this world so I thought that was great,0.087271035
it's like there are no small parts in Star Wars I thought that was fabulous,0.12076567
there are also a couple of great battle sequences in the movie and will some,0.04187253
people find battle sequences boring I am NOT one of those people like if you,0.20393609
loved the big battle secret sequence at the end of rogue one then you will,0.1179721
love this movie because this is definitely an extension of that I mean I could,0.10012982
watch x-wing formations all day long I would love to pilot an x-wing now next,0.15072519
there are also some stunning visual moments here and one in particular that was heightened,0.042823613
by an audience members response in fact it instantly became one of my best movie,0.060909495
going experiences of all time and I will tell you about it in the spoiler,0.069175474
review I wish that this person could be in every one screening to say what,0.1299465
she did at that moment because it would make the movie better for everybody it,0.10529137
was great alright then next although I have to say for the most part you,0.08624023
could hear a pin drop in the theater people were paying rapt attention but also,0.13733882
I really enjoyed the practical effects which made the porks and some other characters that,0.086042434
we can't talk about have the quaint cozy factor that so many characters did in,0.0582007
the original trilogy I mean you knew they were puppets but I know that was,0.28239742
great and I and I love porks by the way I went in hating porks,0.18849213
but now I hope that they never ever go away and by the way I,0.2400681
would like to say that of all the merch that I've seen so far the,0.14666262
copious pork merch none of it has captured the fabulous essence of the porks so,0.26811966
I hope they keep working on it because I'd like to buy something with a,0.07174113
poor guy on it now but I haven't seen anything that would again captures the,0.15360089
spirit of the porks from the movie they're so funny now what did I what,0.24088408
did I not like personally right wasn't anything that I didn't like about the movie,0.0732231
or a Myka saying only other people are gonna have problems no I'm afraid I,0.109548405
had some problems Jim as I said nothing really happens so it's difficult for me,0.11048142
I know some people who aren't really into Star Wars and they didn't like the,0.06334397
force awakens and that that bro Guan was a little boring I know right how,0.24222617
could you find although the beginning rogue one once you've seen it a couple times,0.14909317
you start to understand where people are coming from but anyway it's hard for me,0.2362081
to recommend this movie to them cuz I'm like I think you might be bored,0.21663348
but I don't see how you could miss it either but also the pacing is,0.061329823
off like two thirds in even I was like dude I love what you're doing,0.13651285
here but it's taking you way too long and then on that note I think,0.11061463
it was a mistake I don't want to give too much away but I think,0.08849874
it was a mistake I'll just say this for the rebels to basically be parked,0.14322427
for most of the movie and the rebels come across is pretty incompetent by the,0.44685766
way like wow they got a really step up their game they're starting to embarrass,0.30465087
themselves however I would like to add though that I'm amazed that self-sacrifice and war,0.2804071
has become such a big part of Star Wars after rogue one and now the,0.111874886
last Jedi that is such a complex adult sophisticated concept and it's crazy that family-friendly,0.33315846
Star Wars from Disney would become the franchise that best embodies that and promotes that,0.060970712
I mean it makes her some of the most emotional emotional gut punches of the,0.283693
movie I mean they work their earned they're not cheating they really I was amazed,0.15082254
by them in fact however it does seem that that's the rebels only strategy and,0.11794116
considering the real world history of that from kamikaze Flyers to what's happening across the,0.10919242
globe today like ripped from the headlines I would just be really careful about romanticizing,0.08443947
that Star Wars you have your moments you didn't cheat you earn them but let's,0.12196215
maybe move in a different direction okay especially because they keep doing it again and,0.05857836
again and again as for the characters though I think the Kathleen Kennedy you know,0.037081085
she's really been championing women in Star Wars and trying to really push them in,0.44477507
the mythology right and she's been a little heavy-handed about it but I can say,0.2402151
with the last Jedi that she finally found a balance in the force between female,0.14863688
and male characters and a lot of that has to do with Rey and kylo,0.06211259
Ren I liked them both a lot here and we have so much to talk,0.063014306
about in this boiler review I loved it okay there's also Luke and Leia acting,0.06288708
as a balance there's also Finn and Rose just really good equal gender representation men,0.1151046
speaking of representation po by the way he has a lot of great moments here,0.0961915
they really up to screen time and the character of benefits because of it however,0.044913057
there was some question as to whether or not he was a member of the,0.067659885
LGBT community I mean even Oscar Isaac seemed to be hinting at that but I,0.37495288
can tell you in this movie that they have completely shut that down and stepped,0.29031086
away from it and I think to some degree have even I think hinted of,0.10484621
going in the other direction that's gone also for those looking to Finn for representation,0.0837831
he continues to be a clownish character I liked john boyega's performance here he had,0.56710285
some nice moments but boy do I wish that Finn had more dignity and they,0.18404576
continue to really push this the space janitor angle you know for comedic effect tonight,0.078588545
it is helpful but still he's supposed to you know represent something for a lot,0.06199116
of people and it's unfortunate the movie though has some excellent villains I love them,0.12893924
from the seriously menacing Snoke huge Snoke fan to the comedic ly sniveling general Hux,0.241609
again once I got general hooks I loved general hooks both Andy Serkis and Donald,0.15225574
Gleeson damo Gleeson I always mispronounce his name but they are both huge assets to,0.0956759
the movie but needs you del Toro and Gwendoline Christie though not so much finally,0.15599723
while the battle sequences again are very well thought-out and visually striking they desperately need,0.0699097
to hire a better fight choreographer because the lightsaber battles are unforgivably weak like wow,0.24002858
so in conclusion I feel this is a don't miss for Star Wars fans and,0.06887001
cinephiles because even though the sum is a bit satisfying the individual parts are just,0.26627323
too good to miss also even if you're not into Star Wars you know what,0.07504671
I say roll the dice because again there was so much here that was great,0.12493342
there's so much that was so funny I just said go in anyway and prepare,0.07115685
to be a bit bored you know what the more I think about it this,0.09891233
reminds me a lot of Lord of the Rings you know everyone can share their,0.08989015
moment when they dozed off and a Lord of the Rings movie or a hobbit,0.26360235
movie right and speaking of The Hobbit this franchise that franchise ultimately became too boring,0.1564125
to continue at least on the silver screen and that's something Kathleen Kennedy should keep,0.043979917
in mind if you don't have some reinvention and you get too steeped in mythology,0.26588032
even if you have a ton of like oh moments and this movie has them,0.10070212
you know it's ultimately just not enough to continue boy with all the average Joe,0.24139766
moments I'm like I really want that Disney streaming Star Wars series as well but,0.06398289
anyway we can't talk about too much because this is my non-spoiler review of the,0.060873397
last Jedi and I will definitely be seeing it again in theaters and I think,0.09261813
that's a pretty high vote of confidence so now you can go see it for,0.05649055
yourself and then join me for the spoiler review because if you're into this movie,0.1498063
there is so much to talk about and until then of course you can always,0.060936008
