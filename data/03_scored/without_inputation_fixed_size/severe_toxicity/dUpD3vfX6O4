Mad Max fury road I normally reserved like movie reviews for my tech Channel but,0.07674157
today is something special in a history of Australian cinema there's very few movies that,0.03807777
are as iconic as Mad Max Mad Max 2 was probably considered one of the,0.04100591
most epic a pop apocalyptic car action movies of possibly all-time and it definitely set,0.04388416
a style and a theme that people have tried to replicate in the past for,0.018294545
me I'm gonna be very very biased because of what you Mad Max - so,0.11971643
many times as a child growing up and as an adult and it would rage,0.2088823
probably one of my all-time favorite movies along comes Mad Max for fury road with,0.1054183
Mad Max 3 didn't live up to the expectations as it would hardly be able,0.077615626
to of Mad Max 2 and so here we come - Mad Max fury road,0.03741525
so I saw some of like their previews and some of the pictures and to,0.040090617
me the vehicles looked sort of over-the-top and I didn't really have any excitement or,0.011399252
really a great interest to watch it I kind of thought it might have been,0.017522268
a little bit of a letdown but the movie come and had a look on,0.092298225
Internet Movie Database and everyone's given it on 8 9 10 out of 10 I,0.06516671
thought wow it must be okay and then a movie reviewer and Australia gave it,0.10191212
a 5 out of 5 and I thought maybe there's Thompson about this maybe that's,0.02870201
worth going to check out and so I went to the cinemas to support the,0.027880507
the creation of the movie into and to basically show my interest and support for,0.017391892
the movie and man I was belonging the way so let me just give you,0.029836813
like an insight into Mad Max Mad Max was played by Mel Gibson and there's,0.067578
no possible way that another actor could capture the the heart and the soul of,0.0600448
the character that was Mad Max it was created by Mel Gibson this is not,0.05374418
going to happen and so the first part of the movie that you know he's,0.047019836
going to sort of cause the problem is Mel Gibson is not in it no,0.03084257
matter what your opinion of Mel Gibson is Mel Gibson created the character Mad Max,0.07850963
and he did a really really good job and that was sort of like he's,0.030001113
sort of early days acting so forget about whatever your views are on well Gibson,0.0416538
Mel Gibson is a good actor and Mad Max Mel Gibson isn't Mad Max and,0.097373575
so well just forget about the character of Mad Max at the moment and we'll,0.030326387
just focus on on the theme and the heart of Mad Max it's an apocalyptic,0.07545577
world where gasoline is the most valuable substance that there is water seems to hold,0.02322023
a little value and food you don't even hear about except in dog food Mad,0.076058425
Max 2 and and and so pretty much straight away they've that managed to capture,0.11600803
the heart of what Mad Max 2 was where you know you had your vehicle,0.048185904
and your vehicle was was the life you know it was the thing that got,0.03742323
you from A to B but you're out of trouble and basically it was a,0.110912055
life and so Mad Max and his vehicle was a key part of of the,0.07864866
movie and the truck the truck being such a menacing vehicle is another key area,0.019797195
of the movie and so the movie starts off with Mad Max and it's a,0.052125122
little bit of a letdown at the beginning for me so Tom Hardy plays Mad,0.15964673
Max and there's no point trying to compare him to the original Mad Max so,0.038244735
George Miller the director of the original one has come back for this movie and,0.027408227
uh I don't think anyone else could have done it except him and so the,0.055423766
Tartan Mad Max and he's sort of character role it sort of pushed to the,0.07167753
side and I think that was a really smart move and that the focus of,0.0137706315
the character of the movie was pushed more into Charlie's Theron and I quite a,0.013721408
fan of her and let me just start by saying that the way that her,0.043721855
character come onto the screen with something that was missing I'm trying to give away,0.0350758
spoilers with this set her character up for an immediate development and immediate interest and,0.044014536
not feeling sorry for her but wanting to kind of learn more so they put,0.08140318
more character development on to her character which i think was a really really smart,0.03273036
move so now we're going to get Tom Hardy so Tom Hardy did a good,0.029113758
job I thought you know I tried to forget about the comparisons and I I,0.024647715
think he did a good job as as a as Mad Max not a great,0.14732021
job but it's impossible for him to do that it's just not gonna happen so,0.028725956
you know he did the best job that he could Charlie Theron was the standout,0.018856626
of the movie but she was designed to be the standout of the I'm sorry,0.03586537
sorry sorry she was not the standout of the movie the movie is based around,0.05187501
the vehicles the apocalyptic environment that said that that question of thirst for gasoline and,0.015623833
you know that's sort of what drives you on so I think the movie lost,0.07036778
its passion and drive for gasoline and the focus was instead on on people and,0.060120627
I guess that's just the direction that they wanted to go on an amazing but,0.015822724
Mad Max is about the vehicles the apocalyptic environment and the ride and they captured,0.021955717
their heart of Mad Max and the the driving and an action they captured it,0.042209893
to a tee it was it was cinematic perfection with cars you know it's kind,0.061933253
of like a car chase but the way that they portrayed it in the action,0.024082974
and the vehicles like when I saw the vehicles on screen when you saw them,0.01541297
all together that over-the-top appearance of them was sort of merged into just awesomeness you,0.03268646
know just spectacular almost like military precision of an attack formation of row grade you,0.1548481
know in an apocalyptic environment sorry and so you know the the movie is based,0.038677767
around the chase and the taste is like almost to our events and they somehow,0.035240766
managed to sort of have the action you know it's dark like I sort of,0.046934694
started a little bit I know so I'll let you down a little bit and,0.27890953
you've got a little bit of character development and the characters that they used in,0.023363246
the movie were some of the old characters in the original movies which I thought,0.014795015
was really good and you know they had the bad guy and they definitely captured,0.050554622
sort of what I think they tried to capture in Mad Max 3 but they,0.03395297
did it quite well in this movie of the of the people in the environment,0.100065574
and then the character developed come up and then you know a little bit of,0.035081785
action and started to come on and then it sort of just ramped up and,0.04543138
actually just kept ramping up and ramping up and ramping up and then you've got,0.024263903
like a little bit of a while with a little bit of more character development,0.12696095
and then back in some more action and then kind of it flowed I thought,0.026421094
quite well to the point where you know it's a good movie where you lose,0.06255387
sense of time and you sort of get really wrapped up into the movie itself,0.082241975
so I had like accent a little bit of character development action partes great cinematography,0.041391052
great car stunts the cars themselves were they were over the top but it that,0.0347166
was kind of like the essence of Mad Max you know the whole world was,0.045744013
based around gasoline and your vehicle and so it was it was over-the-top but it,0.030522617
yeah it created that sense of of the of the world in the environment and,0.022261037
the sort of desperation that it was that the characters and white dark I loved,0.012364433
a little bit strange and very strange to hear them talk in a very casual,0.09800883
almost an Australian style accent so that was a little bit of a sort of,0.049198978
a little bit of us how off but it was it worked fine to anthem,0.032705083
ad so I'm giving the movie ten out of ten because I'm completely biased and,0.060048122
yep and so basically Mad Max is like the iconic Australian movie and um I'm,0.047174823
hoping that you will support the movie cinemas and the directors and the actors and,0.024106255
go see this movie on the big screen it's an action movie involving cars that,0.019616932
you will very rarely come across Mad Max 2 was really really good but this,0.11918295
was this was the spectacular in its action and so you know they didn't I,0.0131546715
guess the focus wasn't really on Mad Max it was more on ferocious you Charlie's,0.062499326
there on his character and the cast himself because the movie just you just can't,0.02908848
do a Mad Max movie without Bob Gibson and so they shifted the focus a,0.04871539
little bit off of that to balance it out I guess and so the movie,0.09588157
was very very well balanced in Tom Hardy you did a great job and I,0.018358404
was quite happy with the performance and yeah so I firmly just seen this on,0.027717538
the big screen 3d I don't think is necessary but if you want what's in,0.023443732
3d and it's available in 3d you go for it yeah Dmitry's one of Dimitri,0.03273901
