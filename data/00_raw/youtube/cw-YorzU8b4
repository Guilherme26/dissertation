well this movie opens up a lot of possibilities for Sony and spider-man [Music] spider-man into the spider-verse so into the spider verse is a spider-man animated adventure with Miles Morales spider-man it's actually an origin story of Miles Morales spider-man always he's been doing this for years Peter Parker spider-man's in this movie he has been doing this for years but they come together and something happens and the spider verse gets fractured and other spider-man's get brought into the adventure and spider people spider-gwen and a spider cartoon pigs and I'll bring on the adventure it's a really fun adventure too it's not just fun I mean fun is in here but it has heart you get invested you're really gonna attach to Miles Morales you see that he's at this yuppie school it's just kind of a fish out of water he's really feel for the dude so I feel like if you're a Miles Morales fan going into this movie you're really gonna feel like the movie did him justice if you're not a Miles Morales fan this will bring you over to the Miles Morales side of things he's a legit spider-man really likable dude but the movie was hilarious it was funny as hell to the war spider-man was hysterical having on the floor funny when I was driving home I was comparing this to the Raimi spider-man movie and the Raimi spider-man even the amazing spider-man he doesn't actually get the spider-man suit he doesn't become spider-man till about an hour into the movie this movie is longer he doesn't actually get his stride until the end most of the movie is him learning about it getting a handle on it like the Raimi spider-man skipped over that part he's like I have these powers Uncle Ben died then it zooms into the artwork and then now he's been spider-man for a while this with Miles Morales not Peter Parker is that in between it's the growing pains it's him learning it's him trying to figure it out and being mentored by Peter Parker when I saw the trailer I was like Peter Parker kind of looks like a slob who doesn't care I don't know if I like that there is a story-based reason for it it actually works really well for those movies the animation stylin here's a funny thing because it is stylistic it's pretty slick for the most part it absolutely does work for the type of action based animation they want to show here on the other hand though the animation smooth is but or sometimes some other times it looks like the animation drops frame rate I imagine it's purposely done not accidental like when you're streaming something and it drops frame right it goes from smooth and when people are interacting it looks like they're almost in the stop-motion animation type of frame rate you get used to it the animation does work for the story but they're trying to do is it make a comic book come to life essentially this animation style does work for that and after that you slip into it you really appreciate what the animation does for the action sequences that click frame animation lend itself to action being very fast so it makes for very exciting spider-man action when it's going down so in the end it really does work any negatives I have is like they're just gripes really their nitpick it runs into essentially what the Raimi spider-man movies run into her at least spider-man 2 because that was the one with the villain who was essentially a normal dude like Doc Ock has tentacles but he's a normal guy he's not super power so when Spiderman punches him in the face I feel like you should be out there was actually one joke again I'm gonna say nitpicks there was one joke in here that had to do with the pig that kind of I feel like it broke the fourth wall like - a Deadpool degree and I don't know if the pig is supposed to be like that but it was said by someone else not the pig but I did feel like leave them out of humor - Deadpool and let's do spider-man stuff here again I said nitpicks but something just stood out to me because in the end spider-man into the spider verse was a very fulfilling spider-man origin story it's a word I had when I walked out of it I was like it was very fulfilling it's a great coming-of-age story it's a great superhero origin story it's a Spider Man origin story you haven't seen on the big screen a hundred times or at least twice it has heart it's exciting I like Miles Morales I like the supporting cast all the voice acting was great which is plenty more Hershel alley plays Miles Morales is uncle in this movie which is the same character Donald Glover played in spider-man homecoming very irrelevant for this review but I think it's cool Miles Morales you are cool you have solidified yourself as a legit spider-man in my eyes sorry I'm a little late to that party not only did I like Miles Morales but I liked his relationship with Peter Parker or at least this universe is Peter Parker it was it was a really good story but I will say spider-man into the spider verse is definitely worth watching definitely worth buying on blu-ray I am curious as to the possibilities this opens up for Sonia really am there are some spider-man's stories I would totally love to see on screen in the vein of this animation like right now I'm currently reading superior spider-man I'm in the second trade I'm not too far but I'm really digging it superior spider-man's when doctor octopus's consciousness has swapped with Peter Parker so it's doc Ock's mind in Peter Parker's body and he's like I can be a way more efficient spider-man than he was I'm not gonna waste it like him I'm gonna be a superior spider-man that was reading it just last week I was thinking I was like we will never see this story on the big screen but after this I maybe that'd be really cool see a superior spider-man story in the vein of this animation or an original spider my story I'm just saying this is the Goldilocks zone for Sony you don't have to compete with the MCU do your own thing this is totally their own you knocked it out of the park all right so spider-man into the spider-verse have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
