today I'm going to talk about the new French romance film portrait of a lady on fire so let's talk about it what's a fair bit just inherit a tree on top at the new film portrait of a lady on fire jerked by a Celine sciama and this is a French romance film that I've heard so many good things about I was so excited people were calling it the best foreign film of 2019 have you seen parasite though a young woman is commissioned to do a portrait of another young lady who is about to get married the younger woman does not want to report it to be done since she does not want it to get married other lady has to do the portraits just by memory and being around her there's so much more than just her trying to create this portrait of this lady and I keep saying this lady and that lady I am going to have a hard time pronouncing these names I'm not even going to attempt it but as the two are going along the one who is the painter it has to see how she holds her hands or how she looks at different things and then goes back and tries to paint that and I like that aspect of the movie a lot where they're trying where she's trying to paint by memory and watch certain movements of her is really memorizing but then there's a lot more to it and like I said this is a romance film the two girls are spending a lot of time together and this is one of the most genuine connections romance films I've seen in a long time just feel so realistic and so deeply moving the weight of these two ladies look at each other it's so sweet and what really holds this movie together is definitely that chemistry the two leads in the movie have a chemistry that seems so easy for them to act and allows for their characters to grow throughout the movie the movie does not give you a lot of information about these two girls and their past we know certain things about the upcoming marriage but that's not necessary for you to have a lot of information about them what necessary is that chemistry and their connection as well so throughout the movie we're slowly starting to see them kind of get attracted to each other while also still trying to do a little bit of the painting and it's a very thought-provoking movie filled with some of the best directing and cinematography I have seen this year every single shot from a portrait of a lady on fire is spewing with technical mastery every frame is just so beautiful to look at the color grading for the movie everything is just a treat for the eye and the movie is a slow burn it's not a really quickly paced film you're not gonna get a lot of scenes that just move really quickly there's a times where a lot of the scenes are just them staring at each other and they're not really talking to each other and they're just kind of taking everything in it's a slow burn but it's filled with some really great directing beautiful sequences and this movie is a treat for the eyes and one of the most beautiful films I have seen this year and it's filled with a story that I actually was so interested in watching seeing how she was going to create this painting by memory while also being attracted to the person that she is painting as well and building that connection and then sending her off for marriage we're also building that connection so it's really hard for her to do all of that knowing that there is this marriage coming up and the film does get quite emotional with those moments and the acting is just so impressive it's so believable how the two girls kind of just look at each other there's a scene in the middle half of the movie where she is painting the girls look for the portrait done of her just stares at her and we're just watching her just kind of look at her and it's so sweet and so believable and so realistic so genuine and so emotional watching how she feels about her and how it grows throughout the movie portrait of a lady on fire is one of the best films I have seen it this year I didn't know too much about the movie I didn't see a trailer I saw a poster and I heard that it was really good so I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it definitely paid off one of the best romance films I have
