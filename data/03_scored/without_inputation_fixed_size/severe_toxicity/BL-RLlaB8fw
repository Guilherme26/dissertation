hey oh hey what's up Bradley just want to take another look at you all,0.06753277
right Wow I really need to shave hey guys Carsten rehnquist year if you've been,0.022213142
to any movie in the last few months you've probably seen the trailer for a,0.010131412
little movie called a star is born this film was been getting a lot of,0.036576454
buzz and it stars Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper who I believe also directed it,0.14269121
it's a remake of the original 1977 film and it's been getting a lot of,0.022602275
buzz like I just said so of course I had to see it now based,0.06259378
on the trailer and the poster this really didn't seem like my type of thing,0.018442882
it seemed more like a film for people that live in the suburbs who also,0.046914738
have Waller above their leather couches that says live laugh love and thing is this,0.041303914
movie is not at all like that it's not at all what it was promoted,0.032723043
as in my opinion it seems like a story that's all about this woman's rise,0.15667602
to fame but at least to me it was more about this old country stars,0.02750867
battle with addiction and alcoholism it's actually a pretty heavy film that deals with some,0.035037883
very dense subject matter and I feel like it tackled these subjects incredibly well my,0.08039742
thing with a star is born' is that it's essentially a few different movies these,0.03779773
characters go through different stages of their lives and careers and with each stage comes,0.03210376
a different movie to me and while some of these stages felt very consistent and,0.024392284
good others didn't making the whole film in general feel a little messy I guess,0.023516238
I should address the first stage the the coming-up era which in my opinion was,0.036084883
done the absolute best I think this section of the film is almost flawless it's,0.023034645
amazing there's really nothing to not enjoy about it I loved the acting I loved,0.09223835
the writing the pacing the cinematography all of it felt so fragile and careful and,0.035065822
I loved how it was done it was some of the most enjoyable and smoothest,0.051406056
filmmaking I've seen all year but then as Ally our main character started to get,0.009720994
bigger and her relationship with Jack seemed to get a bit more complicated similar to,0.039514568
the characters the film got really out of control whereas in the first section the,0.013432719
film really had a clear grasp on what these characters wanted and who they were,0.050702292
throughout the remainder of the film they seemed to lose that grasp as each character,0.03336029
seemed to separate further from each other it felt like they took a lot of,0.026865438
time to craft those first 30 minutes and then seemed to rush the rest of,0.029995127
the film to me the heart of this was the editing I felt like the,0.0306949
editing was super awkward and rushed it's very clear that there were scenes that they,0.115843065
really wanted to hold on and focus on but due to time constraints they probably,0.0125513505
had to cut them down the movie is already 2 hours and 13 minutes as,0.15611927
is so it would not surprise me if they wanted to cut this thing down,0.1920944
for the sake of selling more tickets this film at one point would spend like,0.021087652
20 seconds on a certain location and then move on to the next and repeat,0.029674508
that over and over again but it wasn't like a montage that's just how the,0.02944768
film went it made a very smooth and kind of calm drama feel way more,0.019459283
chaotic and fast-paced than it needed to be a clear example of this is when,0.032319278
Jack proposes to Ali out of nowhere it was like the weirdest edit I saw,0.05867119
this year it was just so fast and awkward and uncomfortable the whole audience was,0.026603354
just like wait what my last major flaw with the film it would be how,0.04524313
many different times it ended you think it's over and then it's not and then,0.05756832
it keeps going and then they build it up into the ending and then you're,0.06216474
like oh this is not the ending and then it repeats that over and over,0.036794633
and over again the issue here is that on paper this isn't actually that bad,0.01718502
of an ending it actually kind of makes sense it was just pasted and edited,0.047081698
so awkwardly to make you feel like it was coming to an end when in,0.027257895
reality you still have like 20 minutes left I will say the film did have,0.029143691
a lot going for it though the clear highlight that a lot of people are,0.026196927
talking about is the acting everybody is talking about how amazing Lady Gaga is and,0.07525821
yeah they're right she killed it especially for someone who has limited to no acting,0.385716
experience but in my opinion I think Bradley Cooper did just as good if not,0.046455096
better he destroyed this performance I mean I mean like maybe the best of the,0.11482999
year he totally became this character in a really dark way that left me at,0.019800521
the edge of my seat also that sweet southern accent I mean oh I hear,0.035347193
a lot of people complaining about the cinematography of the film and to be honest,0.02835811
I kind of disagree a lot of the shots are very claustrophobic there are either,0.055162348
mediums or close-ups and I think this really enhances the feel that this film is,0.050732892
going for it's really not a controlled environment that these characters are living in and,0.013477285
while the tight editing didn't do much for me this claustrophobic cinematography really worked and,0.05940755
of course I can't really talk about this film without mentioning the music specifically shallow,0.0419691
which is basically already won the Oscar for Best Original Song it was great it,0.0130522335
gave me goosebumps I listened to it on the way home not much to say,0.12328314
that hasn't already been said overall a star is born was basically built to win,0.015310532
Oscars but I can't really complain I think it'll deserve every nomination and or win,0.07865796
that it gets read Lee Cooper will get a Best Actor nomination Lady Gaga will,0.020246195
get a Best Actress nomination and as we all know shallow would you know yada,0.042386167
yada yada but to be honest I'm not too upset about it I think it,0.07061989
definitely deserves these it's a powerful film that definitely deserves the hype it's been getting,0.088331066
even though it's a little messy and overstays its welcome just a tad I'm gonna,0.13127333
give a star is born' a 3.5 out of 5 thank you all so much,0.020219587
