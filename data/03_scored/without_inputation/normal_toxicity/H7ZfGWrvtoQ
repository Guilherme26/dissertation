eighth grade was directed by Bo Burnham and stars Elsie Fisher as young Kayla a girl in her last week of eighth grade trying to survive because it's absolutely terrible and her life is painfully embarrassing,0.35585836
and this is something that I think a lot of kids and adults can relate to if they've ever been that shy kid in class or the unpopular kid trying to reach out trying to make friends but it takes a different approach to it than films,0.09602811
you may have seen like this from the 90s or early 2000s and so much of this film relies on our hero young Kayla,0.09406134
and Elsie Fisher gives a star-making performance here,0.06992148
she's totally charming completely real and I basically loved everything that she brought to this movie I thought she was so fantastic,0.24966908
and the writing was also very realistic and very authentic for eighth graders the film bridges the gap between acts by having her make a YouTube video,0.053610016
and we see a YouTube video in which she's talking about how to gain confidence or something like that and then we see her dialogue overlaid over a sequence in which we witness her trying to do something that she's talking about in her YouTube videos and what I loved about that is that through those videos that she's making she's trying to reach out she's trying to connect we never really get an idea of if anyone's actually watching her channel that much except for one person in the film who mentions it but despite wanting to create videos about things like confidence or how to be yourself,0.088487044
she has a really hard time doing that in real life which I thought was an excellent commentary on modern-day social media I'm not sure if that's what Bo Burnham was going for,0.106064044
but it does feel like,0.04262588
he's saying look at all these people who are online telling us how to act or how to feel but in everyday life they have no idea how to do it,0.12413793
and I thought that was really beautiful,0.07479074
and the film captured it extremely well throughout the movie Kayla would get opportunities to do things,0.05168337
she wanted to do,0.09406272
maybe,0.038781885
she got invited to a party or maybe she got to go out with some people a little bit older than her and that excited her every single time something was looking up for her in the back of my mind,0.2781731
I'm thinking no it's about to crash and burn,0.526423
this is so terrible I'm getting anxiety just watching this terrible flashbacks of eighth grade oh my god and that's why the writing is so good because you always feel like the Hammers about to drop on this,0.22529219
poor girl you never really feel like she's crawling out of this introverted and very embarrassing phase that she's in even when things are kind of looking up for her her father portrayed by Josh Hamilton in the film I thought was wonderful,0.24047975
he has some beautiful scenes with her however his character does sometimes feel almost too good to be true like so much of the film feels very grounded,0.12529461
and then he's just the best dad ever you could possibly have ever,0.09396081
and it just it just felt a little bit fantastical to me but it wasn't something that took me out of the film it was just kind of,0.069355056
in retrospect looking back on how authentic everything else was he did feel sort of like impossibly perfect,0.08793257
and the film does follow,0.023917312
a formula that we're used to seeing in films like this,0.12057681
for instance there's a young boy that she has a major crush on every time,0.24137342
she sees him we get a close-up of his eyes and some booming techno music which I thought was absolutely hilarious,0.40319648
but there's also that one kid who's really nice to her and in your head you're like,0.24210252
yeah,0.040847696
that's the person you should be talking to you not this guy and we've seen that many times in films before,0.2397447
- but it's the wonderful writing the sharp comedy and the commentary on today's youth that continue to make this film extremely entertaining it also has a nerve-wracking scene in a,0.076052696
car I saw this film with two of my,0.10969051
friends and I think we just held our breath for like five straight,0.15461276
