us is written and directed by Jordan Peele and it's his follow up to get,0.053007647
out which was excellent and extremely surprising I love whenever someone takes a different career,0.14788114
path and you would expect like when Jim Carrey was like in Truman Show and,0.17087753
eternal sunshine back to back I was like this is not what I expected from,0.087411314
Ace Ventura and get out was definitely not what I expected from noise but I'm,0.09226937
glad that we got that because I loved his sketches on Comedy Central but to,0.070012815
see him become what he's become and what he's giving to film and the horror,0.28258508
genre especially it's just been a joy the film stars Lupita and Jung go and,0.06031015
Winston Duke though the mother and father of two young kids trying to have a,0.18081439

know me I'm a big horror fan it's my favorite genre i love horror movies,0.17310783
give me all the horror I wanted I want them all right now just let,0.49950576
me have them all the good ones people need to make good horror people need,0.4477259
to watch good horror people need to support this genre and it's something I'm very,0.16540655
passionate about and hopefully one day I can contribute to myself and it's something I'm,0.05317159
really excited about and I got to say I am just so happy that Jordan,0.06388171
Peele is making movies like this this film was awesome get out was so surprising,0.1351632
and so different but also just so goddamn entertaining and he wasn't Oscar for the,0.6716034
screenplay and so coming off of that obviously there's some pressure to see what you,0.07090735
do and I'm happy that he didn't change himself you know like he didn't become,0.09277697
some pretentious version of what he already was doing so well us is more of,0.1821158
a pure horror film than get out was get out had a lot of social,0.31089434
commentary it was very funny this film has both of those as well but it,0.06484952
has a lot more of the horror stuff there's a lot of blood people creep,0.46941045
around hallways holding fireplace pokers so it's definitely a horror movie it has all the,0.13420108
things that a genre fan would want out of a film like this brutal kills,0.451767
lots of blood and incredible score I'm amazed this is only this composers second score,0.17713854
get out being his first for film anyway according to his IMDB it's so good,0.13478531
I want to buy it I want to listen to it I like to listen,0.07450047
to horror movie soundtracks if I'm writing horror it kind of puts me in the,0.15163158
mood gets me in that field you know what I mean and this is definitely,0.11574806
one of those that I would like to buy and listen to over and over,0.07325757
but it stands out because of the fact that the film can be interpreted in,0.037241083
so many different ways there are some aspects of the movie that are very obvious,0.06760709
that tell you what's happening but then there's a lot of it that is ambiguous,0.06697984
and it's definitely a film that on second viewing you're going to appreciate more and,0.07431172
I can't wait to see it again I'm gonna go see it again this weekend,0.08245967
with my friends because I want to look at it through a different lens and,0.060445804
I want to try to examine some of the imagery that peel's shows in the,0.06572187
film and and what he's going for because there's aspects to it that are you,0.07564057
can look at it I'm trying so hard not to spoil it and I won't,0.08892076
don't worry you can look at the film a certain way and accept what it,0.062284183
is the first time you watch it and it works in that way but you,0.07595662
can also view it from a from a certain lens and I really love that,0.074004546
I love movies that evolve when you watch it again and I am so excited,0.12059466
to do that because this film begs that it really wants you to think about,0.09478654
the film and to have a conversation because there's a lot of ways you can,0.05392962
view the movie it can be an allegory for duality it can be an allegory,0.055644017
for how we view other people you know what is our perception of the enemy,0.101837546
is the enemy within our own selves or is it someone else how do we,0.15423454
personify what we view as an enemy and this movie has a really clever way,0.24009268
of exploring those questions but like I said purely from just a filmmaking standpoint the,0.0678685
movies really well-rounded Lupita Nyong'o is incredible in the movie she is so damn good,0.54187095
in this film that the Oscars will just ignore her and she will not receive,0.22302903
a nomination that's how good she is in the film I say that because Toni,0.099469565
Collette was so good in hereditary the best performance I saw last year and she,0.07440424
did not receive a nomination but this this could break the trend of the Academy,0.052947357
historically ignoring horror films as a genre because it just I like it might and,0.17556283
really everyone in the film is terrific the family has to portray you know the,0.051809654
main characters as well as this doppelganger family and they're so different Winston Duke also,0.14851232
putting aside the fact that everyone plays a dual role his character has to be,0.05583339
scared while also being really goddamn funny throughout the whole film and he pulls it,0.5876557
off and that's another thing I loved about this movie is that the way the,0.08360543
comedy is interwoven throughout it often times and scary films a character will pause to,0.10395314
make a joke in the middle of a scene you're like really man like you,0.47866297
that wasn't funny like someone wrote that and made you say it'd be better but,0.099432744
in this film the comedy really worked because it felt like a family dealing with,0.06941324
this insane horrendous situation and then taking a breather and observing how purely bizarre it,0.31089434
is and just just having to acknowledge the humor in it and I thought that,0.05727633
it just worked perfectly I have really only one major issue with the film and,0.059331056
you know don't worry no spoilers there's an aspect to the movie that I would,0.08755064
have loved to have been more ambiguous but it kind of lets you know and,0.10477793
I just wish that it said no you guys figure that out for the next,0.08398281
30 40 50 years and argue about it forever I wish that that was how,0.06698116
things happened during a certain sequence instead it's like no this is what it is,0.058164526
and I just I like ambiguity and I wish that it was a little more,0.05605028
ambiguous and really other than that I think this is a extremely well made horror,0.14531225
movie a great second film from Jordan Peele if he wants to continue in the,0.079680696
horror genre please do it needs you it really does if you want to make,0.2198772
other films great I want to see it I want to say anything that guy,0.2804012
does even if he makes a movie that maybe isn't as good as these two,0.100420244
that he's made already in in the future I guarantee it'll be interesting I guarantee,0.05921009
it'll be something that you'll want to see just because he made it I'm gonna,0.109773666
give us an a-minus I don't like comparing but just for the sake of this,0.123305894
video I will get out is probably the stronger film thematically but is a better,0.06895125
paced horror movie and it's just like this pure horror film almost from start to,0.23104593
finish and in that aspect i feel like i'll rewatch us many more times plus,0.10426762
i want to because it kind of begs you to do that so I'm very,0.24257885
excited for more people to see the movie and I'm just excited for horror as,0.19405915
a genre right now guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward,0.09852116
