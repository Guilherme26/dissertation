I've already shown you my excitement in my intro yes Wonder Woman is an awesome,0.123781174
fantastic movie it's a great superhero film it's a great origin story one of the,0.087269254
best ordered stories I've ever seen it's definitely the best movie so far this summer,0.045336254
and it's one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it,0.055386238
might even beat out Man of Steel is the best DC EU movie I'm on,0.19295071
the fence about that and I'm a huge fan of that movie so that's saying,0.07554905
a lot so all of us DC fans let's go ahead and take a collective,0.21892454
breath once we met Green Lantern ring yeah another good movie thank you thank you,0.07505653
we are crawling out of the depths of hell of 2016 finally we have another,0.35647127
great DC movie thank you seriously people if you're a DC fan it's been a,0.15070899
little bit scary lately not only was last year really disappointing for most of us,0.21869022
I know that maybe Superman and Suicide Squad have their fans but for the most,0.3184821
part a lot of us were disappointed by those movies there's no secret in that,0.09105425
and all of this news that's been coming out about all the changes all the,0.06006049
drama all these announced projects while not finishing the projects that are already in motion,0.1153174
all the craziness of the DC EU and a lot of us did not have,0.28087422
very much hope left well I'm here to tell you that if nothing else Wonder,0.1495318
Woman gives you extreme hope and extreme optimism for what's to come in the DC,0.3162329
EU learn nothing about the future let's talk about this movie that's what we're here,0.16658866
to talk about right Wonder Woman so the star of Wonder Woman that's where I,0.15134019
want to start off I was one of those people who was worried about gal,0.10889496
gadot I was really on the fence I wasn't sure if they were just picking,0.10681284
her cuz she was a pretty face or because they were trying to make a,0.21625905
star - somebody from The Fast & Furious franchise I wasn't sure about our acting,0.059638612
ability if she can be able to carry a movie and this is easily one,0.07694806
of the most anticipated and one of the most iconic female roles in Hollywood history,0.1165402
so it's very important to nail the casting well I'm here to say people I'm,0.09308677
a believer in gal gadot they nailed the casting I absolutely fell in love with,0.113863274
her over the runtime of Wonder Woman the story that we've heard for a couple,0.0898423
years now is that when gal gadot sat down for the casting session for this,0.08178304
role with zack snyder and a few WB execs they saw a spark in her,0.12790605
they saw something there and regardless everybody's hate regardless of that everybody's doubt they casted,0.19191755
her with extreme confidence and I'm telling you people you will see the spark by,0.07851953
the end of this movie you'll see it within the first 30 minutes of I'm,0.12670028
being totally honest she is charming she is electrifying especially her smile she just has,0.07845545
this beauty about her that embodies that character of Wonder Woman you see the strength,0.13639654
you see the value you see everything that that character needs to bring to the,0.07877066
screen to really convey who that character is because most of us aren't really familiar,0.056020986
with the actual core elements of that character aside from the fact that what we,0.07226727
saw in the old incarnations of the TV show she brings everything to the forefront,0.15957104
and even the side of the character that's a little bit naive because she's somebody,0.4282027
who's been on a secluded Island for so long and now she's in the world,0.10769686
of man she's in the world of all these flaws of all this death of,0.5062246
all this hate all of that naivety of her character comes through with her performance,0.5433463
really easily it's almost like it was second nature for her and it blew me,0.1896951
away watching that I was like holy crap she is nailing this yep that's not,0.8060606
going to work please put the sword down Lana Dinah let me try something up,0.45562828
to you sir and another part of her performance that she really nailed is the,0.18199237
chemistry and the back-and-forth between her and her love interest Steve Trevor played by Chris,0.058357064
Pine and Chris Pine is the other strongest part of this movie they were amazing,0.05259327
together they are one of the very few couples in a superhero movie one of,0.072990984
those love interest couples that you immediately buy into and you're really emotionally invested in,0.17225134
their journey in their relationship and at the end of the day you want to,0.06696918
see more about them it's no longer about I want to see some badass action,0.3137377
I want to see what's going to go on between those two characters the millions,0.094004676
of people you talk about they will die I win anyway you mean you were,0.46231666
lying you're spy that's what I do do I know you're not lying to me,0.53490317
right now I am taking you to the front hey Chris Pine let me tell,0.06543201
you me I have not seen Chris Pine give a bad performance yet that guy,0.28942147
can do no wrong in my eyes so far I love this captain Curt a,0.12571123
lot of the independent stuff that he's done like when he popped up in smokin,0.10345662
aces one of his first roles the dude is just awesome and in this he's,0.0967927
got the same qualities that he has when he brings Captain Kirk into this new,0.1506394
incarnation he's got the charm he's got the wit he's got the humor and you,0.18474245
really understand why Princess Diana would really gravitate towards this guy Steve Trevor has kind,0.09423143
of her example for what a man is supposed to be because he has all,0.15597019
of these characteristics and all of these traits that you would want to be exemplified,0.24186493
in your ideal man he's got a lot of charm he's got a lot of,0.112448625
dignity he really wants to fight the war and World War one was to take,0.20270088
out the bad guys at all cost even if it cost him his life he,0.23321885
is ready to put all that on the line and that's awesome and that's totally,0.053420555
why they go together so well as a couple because diana has those same exact,0.08289785
characteristic traits she wants to fight regardless what happens to her because it's the right,0.1597377
thing to do and so does Steve Trevor and I'm not going to get into,0.053432535
all of them but I will say that pretty much every single side character nails,0.17791976
their performance and they really fit their piece into this story in this movie really,0.07741561
well all the Amazonians like Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright they all do really they,0.053475898
really have that badass warrior quality this island is basically the Spartans from 300 but,0.24179848
women and their badass Lucy Davis is really funny and really entertaining in the small,0.53490317
partner she has at a candy all of the little ragtag group had tags along,0.281766
with Steve Trevor into battle and the third and about halfway through the second half,0.058835596
of this movie but they're really funny they're very similar to the ragtag group that,0.15163958
Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes put together in Captain America the First Avenger not to,0.108956255
compare it to a Marvel movie chill the nlgger out DC fans small comparison if,0.17920774
I had to give one negative as far as characters and I know I usually,0.09881652
save negatives for later I'm going to get it out of the way now because,0.13138899
it's honestly the only negative I had with this entire movie is Dana Houston's character,0.08342037
and it's not necessarily his character because his character is utilized well for the story,0.042983904
and what his villainous role needs it to be can't really give too much detail,0.1507476
there was going to be spoilers but Danny Huston just really hams it up and,0.08469498
anything that he's ever done really he really hams it up he throws his cheese,0.17995201
out there he's chewing up the scenery and he really feels out of place he,0.094699115
feels like he's in a different movie all together and I didn't love what they,0.14980656
were doing with his character ultimately in the third act they do pull it out,0.06353667
of the Hat and kind of make that flaw acceptable again can't really give any,0.09171337
spoilers but you understand what I'm talking about to see the movie so it's a,0.11095722
very small negative but he's the only character run my hand just not buying this,0.13388444
guy and if I can be honest I'm getting a little bit warmth in on,0.3219788
kind of the generic stock evil German bad guy we've seen it a million times,0.492778
I know it fits the timeframe of when this movie came out World War one,0.24818745
but I've seen it a million times I've seen it done better I was talking,0.06045755
about the story because this is the element of things that the DCE use so,0.053658854
far with the exception of Man of Steel in my opinion has really slipped up,0.053883474
on they really try to throw a bunch of things in there there's not a,0.087370105
whole lot of a cohesive flow to their stories they're just trying to really fast,0.054969467
forward to catch up to get to where the Justice League is so they can,0.061727814
be right alongside Marvel and I'm here to relieve you that Wonder Woman really takes,0.29088914
its time and tells the story that it needs to tell from the very beginning,0.03687527
when she's a little girl telling you all the way up to whenever she's adult,0.31605467
how much she's trained how much she has really had this will to be the,0.09902372
best warrior of the Amazon why she is worthy of the name of Wonder Woman,0.1554967
why she is worthy to wield the weapon of the god killer why she is,0.65019023
so determined to leave everything that she has ever known in her entire life good,0.24242611
to go and help innocent people you buy into that and that's the characters that,0.05352305
we need to have in the DCE we've seen the somber side we've seen the,0.032983456
really downside we've seen death we've seen darkness we've seen destruction it's time for some,0.18006706
levity it's time for some positivity and that's what Wonder Woman is she's here that,0.40325347
you can get behind and it actually really intrigues me and excites me even though,0.5918246
I have my doubts about Justice League about seeing her interaction with Bruce Wayne about,0.1416075
how she is going to be a good foil for him how she's going to,0.08785887
be that symbol for hope and that push to make him that superhero that he,0.071037896
can be when Superman is gone because Bruce Wayne the one that we have in,0.06327487
this current universe is down he doesn't believe in hope he doesn't believe in good,0.10691286
he doesn't believe in humanity and Wonder Woman is the perfect character to show him,0.15037104
why you should believe in all those things and ultimately what I love about the,0.05421298
story of Wonder Woman and how they really tailored the story of Princess Diana in,0.07311226
this movie is that it's not your stock boards in the story where you have,0.058641125
a superhero that just discovers their powers and they're trying to build up enough strength,0.073078014
throughout 90 minutes to finally take down the big bat in the third act there's,0.14697535
elements of that but that's not what the core story this movie is about it's,0.071898036
about a character who is good down to her core who is built and driven,0.1490179
to protect the innocent to protect humanity finally getting exposed to the flaws of humanity,0.27831626
but seen through those flaws and seeing the good in humanity and the reason why,0.06765362
there is ultimately hope in the end and there is a reason to protect that,0.047829915
hope even when you're watching the big climactic third act showdown between her and the,0.119967386
main villain of this movie to me I wasn't watching the hero triumphing over a,0.13259321
villain I was watching a hero triumphing over her doubt of humanity and I was,0.3261398
incredible how they were able to blend those two things simultaneously in the same story,0.03949349
and while I'm talking about the story there's one detailed at the very beginning of,0.028826214
the movie in the very end of the movie that I need to comment on,0.07121281
because I was really happy with the way that they did this the way that,0.041751828
they incorporate the story of this movie into the overall picture of the DC EU,0.095667474
was masterfully done because it's done really tastefully it really enhances the story and really,0.043849282
cares to the story of who Princess Diana is and the journey she goes on,0.09248654
in this movie it's actually kind of a really emotional moment whenever it all comes,0.075815655
together towards the end but it doesn't distract from the fact that this is a,0.03411381
Wonder Woman movie there's not Batman cameos there's not the flash cameos nobody's flying by,0.14921363
in a red cape none of that's going on just a small little detail that,0.11082379
lets you know just in case you weren't aware this is in the DC EU,0.13884091
along with that maybe Superman and Man of Steel and all that but it doesn't,0.052199684
distract the movie at all it actually adds to it so I thought that was,0.0823793
a small detail that they nailed in this and a lot of the credit I,0.13012736
got to give to the director patty Jenkins I mean we were all really optimistic,0.06963994
from the time that this woman got signed on the director of monster is directing,0.4878387
your Wonder Woman movie that's like a dream come true and luckily they utilized her,0.23159386
they let her make the movie she wanted to make and we have the Wonder,0.074242696
Woman awesome badass masterpiece movie that we have in front of us now because they,0.46595868
trusted their director and I hope that this is a sign of things to come,0.13236286
for the DC EU because they have a lot of great directors and a lot,0.050884437
of great writers on their billing currently to do some of the movies that are,0.087539755
already planned and as long as they let them make their movie the way that,0.08259722
they let patty Jenkins make her Wonder Woman movie we're all going to be just,0.18240197
fine but seriously patty Jenkins did an incredible job I love the way that she,0.15837611
really structured and divided up this movie into three separate acts because each act has,0.065811455
its own flavor its own tone and they somehow all blend together to make one,0.08110531
really cohesive story that's not easy to do like your first act is definitely your,0.10462141
sword and sandals movie you're introduced to the island of that mascara you get introduced,0.2319956
to the world of the Amazonian you've got Diana and from birth all the way,0.10963134
up to an adult you get all of that great stuff the second act is,0.16662192
more of a period piece you get a little bit of spy movie flavor in,0.24137387
there as where a lot of the budding romance and the relationship between Chris Pine,0.030994397
and gal gadot really starts to grow back or maybe not and then your third,0.3044156
act is your war movie that's when World War warm that whole setting really starts,0.10286775
to take shape you get Princess Diana sharing all of her clothes to deal that,0.23132809
awesome armor that looks unbelievable on gal gadot by the way walking into a hail,0.15153465
of gunfire showing what she is made of what she is here to do what,0.2595678
she is here represent and from then on it is just balls to the wall,0.6548211
great action scenes great set pieces a lot of amazing camerawork especially when they're doing,0.084157124
like horseback riding and everything the way that they shoot between the trees and the,0.35528156
way that Patti Jing has really framed a lot of shots whenever they're doing fight,0.31089434
scenes and you see a lot of these slow-mo flips around and there's no point,0.3698055
in the action scenes when you can't tell what's going on it's all really cohesive,0.07217645
it's all really focused all of that came together awesome all of the action in,0.076147094
this movie is awesome it's all directed great gal gadot is really physical you can,0.10910919
tell if she really trained for this role and she was not taking the role,0.073204234
of Wonder Woman lightly she wasn't taken as a paycheck she is here to bring,0.10155278
you the iconic female superhero that Wonder Woman is and the last thing that I,0.25058815
really need to nail down in this review is that the score and this movie,0.07545676
is nlgger incredible now I am NOT a guy that talks about scores very often,0.20252126
I don't know very many composers name I don't really have soundtracks or any kind,0.11664045
of scores on my iPod that I'm listening to and it's honestly a weakness whenever,0.18880466
you look at me in trivia games Sean but from the opening frame of this,0.0893336
movie the score literally grabbed ahold of me it's one of the greatest superhero scores,0.12608722
that I've ever heard in my life and I might even download it to listen,0.14987393
to it some more because it is that nlgger good the store itself is telling,0.23972695
the story alongside the movie you can almost close your eyes and just listen to,0.088070154
the score for two hours and the music is going to take you to the,0.17152084
same journey that patty Jenkins Chris Pine and gal gadot take you in while watching,0.16808395
these characters it's incredible so wrap all this up guys Wonder Woman is an incredible,0.10951014
superhero movie it's a great origin story it's an incredible piece of the DC EU,0.10430831
that we so badly needed and it just gives you a huge symbol of hope,0.13094512
and optimism for what's to come out of the DC EU gal gadot absolutely nailed,0.20875813
it I fell in love with her over the runtime of this movie as I'm,0.24402012
saying it again I fell in love with her Chris Pine was incredible patty Jenkins,0.15187494
was incredible the score was incredible only one tiny little weakness with one of the,0.098108515
villain characters that's easily glossed over because the way that they utilized that character this,0.11674243
movie was just a wild ride it was an absolute joy to watch I think,0.16735816
just about everybody is going to be pleased by this I can't think of anybody,0.10191581
who will watch this story see these characters and seek out without performance especially and,0.08796369
walk away turning their nose up I think this is one of the best comic,0.25433716
book movies to ever be made it's definitely one of the best DC movies to,0.059811443
be made since the Dark Knight and it's absolutely worth your attention worth your time,0.123877555
and worth your money so go see it in theaters and then when it comes,0.11214072
out on home video go out and buy it so what did you guys think,0.10251806
of Wonder Woman is this the best DC EU movie that we have gotten I'm,0.11768387
still on the fence about that or Man of Steel keep an eye out for,0.076636
my ranking video I'll be having this weekend where I finally have to make that,0.06655812
decision I need to watch Mayo steel one more time but it's definitely going to,0.0452891
be a tight race is this your favorite DC movie that's coming out since the,0.109353215
Dark Knight do you love gal gadot do you hate gal gadot do you love,0.26085824
