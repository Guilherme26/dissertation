from [Applause] all right so let's see now if this movie is worth all the,0.061405882
hype my name is Brendan Keith Avery and this is just my opinion hey what's,0.09961945
going on everyone thank you so much for tuning into my appearance lash review for,0.34431604
a star is born I really do appreciate it now this family stars born is,0.06044464
a remake of the 1937 original film of the same name which I have not,0.056219786
seen and actually this is the fourth film that is being remade by the same,0.06627136
title the interesting thing is the past three film was one of the main protagonists,0.07822828
in the film which Bradley Cooper is playing in this new age one in 2018,0.05243837
his name was Norman but in this film here his name is Jack so that's,0.10226296
one of the differences that I noticed when I was trying to look up some,0.043054488
information and Bradley Cooper is the writer and director of this film this is also,0.0639723
his directorial debut and I'll just go ahead and say that he did a damn,0.7093121
good job you know he actually said in the past that he wanted to get,0.038111795
into directing before acting but sometimes things just don't work out the way that we,0.07118878
planned but you know of course he's a great actor and I can now say,0.112834334
that he is a great director at least based on this film now there has,0.07653419
been a lot of buzz with this film right here it debuted at a I,0.10959256
think it was the Venice Film Festival earlier this year in August 13 August 31st,0.032191183
of this year after the film play after it finished you know they got a,0.027962916
Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga they got a standing ovation for about eight minutes and there's,0.18169299
been so much Oscar buzz around this film to saying you know how great the,0.11531295
performances is and you know all that good stuff and it is gonna get some,0.07358484
occur Oscar recognition and I will go ahead and say that I do agree with,0.021074612
that I'm just going to say that this is a fantastic film it's a beautiful,0.100872666
film I would be pretty surprised if it did not get any type of Oscar,0.116109475
nom nominations or even win but why not only because it's a great story but,0.048997343
we have some great performances by both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga herself now I,0.072583176
am not necessarily a little Gaga fan I don't have anything against her but I,0.08167418
can say that after watching this movie right here I am a fan of Lady,0.27348006
gaga I mean she did a great job singing on stage on screen and she,0.2080346
did a great job performing and this movie right here is going to make me,0.11716709
want to pay attention to her work going on now in the future but like,0.07275933
why is this movie good to me why is it so great like I said,0.10057746
it's a great story is full of passion and emotions and I'm just really fond,0.07710053
of like where the film focused what it's about is Bradley Cooper's character Jack he,0.027145287
is a seasoned music musician he has some alcohol and drug problems that he's dealing,0.20422019
with you know but he's still you know a fantastic musician and you know just,0.09776503
by you know going around the block or by look or however you want to,0.08102199
say it he runs into Lady Gaga's character by the name of Allie and you,0.08698738
know he just sees something in her and just once her to reach these these,0.10439182
Heights you know he wants her to reach these goals of being you know the,0.0668176
best new songwriter slash musician and he's just kind of helping her along the way,0.0720282
now this feeling might here could have copied on a lot of the cliche tropes,0.0636693
you know three-act structure of a film to where you know you see the rise,0.093342006
in the fall of you know a said actor actress or you know performer musician,0.20805332
or something like that and how it focuses on you know how they try to,0.08122587
you know go into the media and try to cater to everyone and become like,0.062034134
the next best pop star and things like that and how it turns them down,0.18532419
you know on the inside out and things like that know this film didn't really,0.07021053
focus on that at all what it focused on was the characters themselves and their,0.07157486
relationship and you know just kind of how they dealt with things and I was,0.06927851
just about to give us full up but I don't I don't want to do,0.060601708
that but you know the song choices in this family here are just beautiful I,0.05227458
mean they really had a lot of weight to them and meaning and you felt,0.10549908
it when you know they were singing on stage and Lady Gaga also said in,0.05532425
the past interview that she is tired of looking at movies to where the actors,0.15348819
or actresses are trying to pretend and live synch with the real songs and they,0.09116277
really just don't do a great job there and of course she would have a,0.09948059
great eye because she is a real life you know recording artist so she kind,0.24677923
of knows her stuff she knows her lane as far as that's concerned so her,0.1365307
I'm Bradley Cooper did get together and practice singing live on stage you know off,0.08625399
camera and on camera and you know that practice paid off because they just made,0.094983175
a great duet on screen on stage and you know I just thought it was,0.06724574
really fantastic Bradley Cooper also say to himself in a couple of many views that,0.105564065
he took singing for granted because he just really did not know how are difficult,0.11149749
it was but he did take some voice acting not voice acting but voice lessons,0.1375861
just to you know really hit the nail down center home you know to give,0.15404537
a great performance but you know like I said the film didn't focus on all,0.04080386
that extra crap it really focused on their relationships and the demons that they have,0.8401703
to deal with and you know when we're with me a regular consumer a regular,0.12512846
person or whatever one we see Beyonce or little Wayne or Lady Gaga or whoever,0.17915982
the hell that is performing whether they're on the movie screen the TV show or,0.36304796
recording artists or whatever we kind of put them on a pedestal that they're just,0.15191725
like the perfect being and they have their life together and just there's nothing wrong,0.11803096
and they just wake up every day freshly bathed don't even have to wipe under,0.2413401
their arms and put on deodorant and this is everything is just you know great,0.12429577
and wonderful for them but no this film right here kind of just takes it,0.09386624
gives you a different perspective of their life and just kind of shows you you,0.17145352
know everything that you know these normal people you know have to deal with there,0.104259774
was even a couple of scenes to where you know like it's kind of rude,0.26512024
to wear when you see a celebrity you kind of just jump off in their,0.4576613
face like hey can I take a picture kind of like a picture that Yatta,0.09652014
Yatta me and then you know like they just want to eat their hamburger on,0.26392773
fire - or wood or whatever you know I'm saying like everybody else they don't,0.1529393
want to be bothered and the film kind of dealt with it and I like,0.10712034
the way that they dealt with him I kind of said that back to back,0.15643224
another thing that was just kind of fascinating to me is just like their relationship,0.07211114
and you know just kind of how they handle this certain situation that you know,0.060666017
they had to go through and like different hardships and things like that and one,0.06138563
of the things that spoke to me the most when I was watching this film,0.08236382
is in something that I can relate to something that I did we're going up,0.025436334
as always wrong about what other people think of you and that you shouldn't do,0.1432018
that it's just really none of your business you know do your thing don't worry,0.15438093
about what other people think and if you really have if you truly really just,0.06977683
have somebody that's down for you like a down-ass chick or down as dude or,0.9156528
whatever you know I'm saying that just has your back no matter what there's your,0.24012436
support system right there that's all you have to worry about as far as somebody,0.060519543
worrying about you all that other stuff is just you know random noise that you,0.105855644
can you know just let go through one ear and out the other and you,0.1240402
know this film really put that on the forefront but it was a beautiful film,0.07610533
great performances great acting great singing great passion great emotion I didn't tear up or,0.060859174
anything like that when I was watching it but I can hear all those sniffles,0.134989
and you know runny noses and all that when the theater when I was watching,0.1625755
other people just getting really emotional and so I really do recommend you see this,0.11118225
film is like I said it's fantastic it's just the beautiful film on so many,0.09970302
levels and I would really be surprised if it did not get any type of,0.09958275
Oscar attention if I had the rate of stars born out of a 1 out,0.0778179
of 10 I will give this a nine point five out of 10 yes a,0.10656409
