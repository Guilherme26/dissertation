hi I'm dr. Josh Matthews this is my series what makes this movie great and,0.021486763
this is episode 7 the movie today is Charlie Chaplin's modern times a modern times,0.028157223
is a 1936 movie by Charlie Chaplin one of the most famous movie makers ever,0.02716477
this is the last movie that shows you the Little character who Charlie Chaplin is,0.019020926
famous for little tramps costume and in particular his walk is probably the most famous,0.2810472
image of any individual character in movie history or at least one of the most,0.02167634
famous walks of any movie character I like modern times because it feels first of,0.023179654
all contemporary second of all it's more philosophical and slightly less sentimental in Chaplin's other,0.042485278
movies maybe even somewhat cynical and Chaplin combines his desire to entertain and make us,0.054752596
laugh and have fun at the movies with social commentary of course but even more,0.026684508
than that this question of who are we as individuals within the mass society we,0.04847459
now exist in the movie features The Little in the modern world really the modern,0.039429426
urban world of either Europe or America and he shows the in a variety of,0.048242442
situations within the big modern city the is a factory worker who is more or,0.029278724
less being oppressed the factory surveil him any works just a terrible job well it's,0.09605452
funny on the one hand as you watch the clip of the factory belt and,0.029510872
the trying to screw on every little bolt as the parts go down the belt,0.2509153
the social commentary here is pretty obvious factory workers have it bad and not only,0.029788254
that during the movie the is part of the labor union which strikes and he,0.053400945
himself is subjected to forces that he cannot control either the factory owner himself or,0.022885643
the factory as a corporation or as a member of the labor union which also,0.03136208
tells him what to do the movie is very bitter I think in telling us,0.052553497
that the Little would prefer jail over living in society trying to find a job,0.14349674
trying to be a good citizen early in the movie the in fact tries to,0.023823552
steal food from a restaurant and deliberately gets arrested so that he can go back,0.14674018
to jail and enjoy life in a comfortable jail cell which is better than anything,0.119668536
else in the modern urban city the is also hard-luck figure in most Chaplin movies,0.0313674
and in this one in particular but in this case the is an individual who,0.020835547
gets caught up in ideologies and in movements spearheaded by ideologies or big ideas such,0.06385098
as fascism communism labor union ISM you name the ISM the is sort of caught,0.10777106
up in it at one point he accidentally leads a communist or workers revolt and,0.10635555
in another moment he accidentally throws a brick or kicks a brick at a policeman,0.28877598
while the Labour Union is on strike and there gets himself arrested the doesn't fit,0.05459495
into any social system he doesn't fit into the Machine which is the factory system,0.016619613
which is the system of workers earning money through laboring in factories but he doesn't,0.032766283
fit in with the labor unions and the herd or masses of people in the,0.09839596
urban environment that's one reason I really like this movie it doesn't just criticize one,0.025257023
group it criticizes just about everything the world of the city in modern times contains,0.042491265
social systems that are oppressive to actively harm people in one particular case the tramps,0.25800493
girlfriend is hounded by juvenile detention officers she ought to be in a home or,0.17795591
in a system rather than out making money as an entertainer and as a waitress,0.058538157
the system separates this woman from her sisters and so the families effectively segregated by,0.050533336
the social systems in the city the social systems don't work at all but on,0.0128726335
the other hand the movie criticizes the masses of individuals who join groups or tribes,0.06769907
and then basically walk around like sheep or herd animals that's the commentary in the,0.050446197
opening shot of the movie where you see sheep going across the screen and then,0.19123764
it fades into a group of men going across the screen this is a wonderful,0.045210537
bitter cynical opening shot and I think it's strange for Chaplin to do this because,0.16499016
it was such an optimistic entertainer and yet those sheep what do they tell us,0.07320945
that the masses of people who join groups whether their labor unions or some kind,0.091963634
of ideological group or herd animals they're not interesting unique individuals on the other hand,0.1414034
the herd is critical of the social systems including the factories that herd these men,0.065312386
into them and forced them to do the same thing over and over just like,0.10866041
livestock so I don't say this movie is for against capitalism for or against labor,0.049416494
unions I think it wishes for a better life and there's a one there's one,0.04249326
very funny scene in which the and his girlfriend imagine what life would be like,0.07859877
if they had a nice Pleasant home a utopian like bourgeois environment there's no real,0.06956424
set place for the in this modern urban world of modern times and throughout the,0.057013556
movie he's constantly inadvertently creating chaos he screws up the factory in the factories machines,0.091223285
he accidentally destroys a ship that's being built on a harbor when he and his,0.13558704
girlfriend find a home the home basically falls apart just by being around things a,0.039038297
little causes chaos now it turns out the perfect job for him is as an,0.13778149
entertainer and by the end of the movie he becomes a waiter and then a,0.026636614
singer he's beloved by the crowd in the restaurant or cafe that he's at as,0.035051186
a singer but once again the social system oppresses him and his girlfriend they basically,0.0902428
get him kicked out of that job and the two of them go wandering off,0.25656325
by the end of the movie having nothing and nobody now this is a typical,0.052531548
Chaplin movie where there are some great gags it's very entertaining and yet many of,0.04504424
these gags connect together to create lots of great meaning for one the is always,0.036183994
trying to balance himself or even as the metaphor would go live a balanced life,0.03641548
this is impossible to do in the modern city and yet he tries valiantly to,0.0209912
balance himself he'd like to have a wife a house and a career but he,0.04769766
can't get any of those three I think the balancing act of the trying to,0.024883855
maintain his dignity trying to stay upright literally and the city forcing him off balance,0.025348153
off kilter throwing him off getting him thrown in jail is well symbolized in one,0.2555642
of the final scenes where the works as a waiter and he's trying to take,0.040805027
a dish of roast duck to an angry customer he gets caught up in a,0.099341854
dance scene where the masses or herds of people dance around and keep him from,0.072244264
getting that roast duck to the customer the masses effectively keep the from doing what,0.09186319
he wants doing what he ought to do and he barely maintained his composure or,0.053497396
his balance as he waddles and wanders through these masses people this dancehall mass group,0.12128426
is not unlike the opening image of the sheep by the end of this movie,0.021727558
you get the idea that the and his girlfriend are unique individuals who can't live,0.06596959
in either the modern urban world or modern time the last shot is a great,0.09662857
shot full of hope and yet full of melancholic hope I highly recommend this movie,0.45772293
to anybody including two children my own children cackle that this movie throughout its entirety,0.22101924
did they get any of the significance I've talked about in this video probably not,0.04495843
much but this movie is meant for anybody and I think it is just as,0.049153745
important today as it was in 1936 for anybody of any political ideology any belief,0.060497124
system I think this movie will resonate with you I believe that's why the 2019,0.027991593
hit movie Joker which gained over a billion dollars at the box office significantly quoted,0.10857859
modern times my view is this is Chaplin's best movie overall and thus it's one,0.060010206
of the best American movies ever made and certainly one of the best silent era,0.03197338
movies ever made I know yeah this movie is not a silent movie although it's,0.030796006
in the guise of a silent movie and there's a big surprise at the end,0.037894182
when Charlie Chaplin for the first time in his history and as an actor and,0.03497336
director opens his mouth and you hear his voice for the first time in a,0.058353234
movie watch for that at the end of modern times it's really funny thanks for,0.02709027
