yes summer 2015 it looks like it's off to a pretty solid start just in the month of May with a month pull often Imams Mad Max fury road so Mad Max fury road is the fourth Mad Max movie in the George Miller Mad Max movies the last one which was Beyond Thunderdome came out 30 years ago now is like a well I guess there's more to tell so let's make a new Mad Max movie and this one Tom Hardy plays Mad Max it's a pretty simple premise for the movie it's an escort mission from a videogame you got to get this huge truck from point A to point B long stretch of post-apocalyptic desert road and while they're doing that leets of crazies and maniacs are gonna try to kill them and that's Mad Max fury road now this movie's crazy I'm not gonna lie to you it's just out of its mind it's George Miller's Mad Max doing George Miller Mad Max things with a bigger budget at a point you look at it you're like this movie's like a cartoon version of it's crazy post-apocalyptic sell difference between when this movie does it in a lot of other movies there's a lot of other movies it doesn't make any sense in this movie completely makes sense you're like yeah we're half past the precipice of madness I guess people aren't saying anymore [ __ ] max is kind of crazy I imagine if humanity was left to its own devices to find itself it would be at least this crazy now getting right into the action because this movie is pretty much built for the action the action in this movie is crazy not only is it impressive not only is it high octane but it's practical George Miller built this movie on practical special effects not visual effects yet this green screen in this movie there are visual effects when it calls for it but generally speaking when cars are flipping and blowing up that's a car flipping and blowing up it's artillery it's pyro it's something real and we're all were a lot of things are CGI you just appreciate that stuff more but the funny thing is I don't know why this movies called Mad Max because Charlize Theron is actually the badass in this movie this is Charlize Theron movie should be called for her name's Furioso she should be called furiosa Road and Mad Max yeah he's in this movie - Mad Max is the second biggest badass in this movie in the third most interesting character not only Charlize Theron character interesting but Nicolas Holt's character interesting too because up to this point we've only just seen these crazies be crazier like yeah just fleets of crazies and we know they're the bad guy as in Max's the good guys we're gonna root for max against the crazies crazy crazy crazy people in Mad Max are crazy but Nikolas Holtz character brings an element of humanity to that you're like oh what's going through their mind oh [ __ ] they have feelings that's weird didn't know that for 30 years and this movie has a menacing bad guy too who looks like the father of sweet tooth from twisted metal in fact given the setting and the action and the cars and the racing and the carnage in this movie I'm pretty sure it is the father of sweet tooth from twisted metal you take the cover art of twisted metal and you just put Mad Max fury road on it it'd be a pretty applicable poster for this movie the bummer is the fact that this movie is ultimately a big action sequence all wrapped up into two hours we've got a lot of character development among the characters in this movie there are a couple of moments of heart a few moments of development that's for sure it doesn't stick and that's not what you remember you watch this movie for the action you walk out going yeah the action was pretty friggin sweet which is why you should watch the movie and the movie knows that and it knows what it is and it plays up what it is if you haven't enjoyed any of the Mad Max movies before you're just going into this movie to critique the [ __ ] out of it or it'll walk out being like yeah movies stupid I didn't like it but if you want to see a post-apocalyptic movie with a two-hour action sequence we'll say one and a half will round down Mad Max fury road is definitely worth watching and certainly worth buying on blu-ray perfect party movie to have some friends over see some death destruction carnage cars explosions Lord death more destruction or carnage right guys so Mad Max fury road have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought of the madness comment below let me know and as always if you liked what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more
