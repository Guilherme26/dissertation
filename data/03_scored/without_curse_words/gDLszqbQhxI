a war fans welcome back to room 237 coming at you with another review of,0.24188189
1920s silent horror film this time I'm going back all the way to 1920 with,0.15113685
the cabinet of dr. Caligari which I'm holding this up because I don't own it,0.07686296
like many films back then as part of the public domain so you can find,0.072230555
it on YouTube which is how I watched it but I would love hold it,0.11254392
like an idiot but I would love to own this because I really enjoyed this,0.8785311
movie as far as silent films go I will put it up there with Nosferatu,0.17526045
it might actually be tied with a very different film it's very easy to see,0.0727332
the influence in it um I mean especially with people like Tim Burton or any,0.16157515
sort of visual filmmaker and the thing about dr. Caligari is it is widely considered,0.06057705
to be the first true horror film way back in 1920 course is debatable there's,0.118309736
been horror films before then mostly short films or trick films this was the first,0.1106623
one that I think was full-length and not a trick for my guess but yeah,0.05024791
so while it considered to be the first ever horror film so I have this,0.14102508
is a movie I want to see for a long time I've heard it mentioned,0.06054613
I've seen it referenced a bunch of times in movies for the longest time I,0.06444581
thought it was part of that 50 movie collection that I have I don't and,0.07881386
it's been kind of hard for me to find except for online but you know,0.16268787
I mean what can be said about it that hasn't already been said it is,0.054859784
a I mean saying its original would be kind of crazy because of how old,0.357396
it is of course is original I would I will say that this movie is,0.07634783
a bigger our prime example of the German expressionist movement then say Nosferatu just because,0.10765727
of the visual style and Nosferatu feels mo even though it is German expressionist it,0.09630379
feels more straightforward then this does this is like witnessing someone's dream that's how crazy,0.35358748
and trippy this movie is I mean the whole movie literally looks like this it,0.2249289
looks like it is done on a stage like weird angles like the way streets,0.1154263
are depicted jagged lines windows are like triangles shadows from like lampposts or furniture or,0.0853241
trees is actually painted onto the set so you get this very artistic look to,0.05503772
the film which I find very fascinating and very in other senses you could say,0.063161634
it's cheesy and cheap but with this it really feels more artistic and more more,0.11463209
intriguing to look at see if I could just pull something up I should have,0.035388444
done this before but I didn't anyway and this the story is rather simple it,0.04209362
it is all it opens up with this young man named Francis played by because,0.0646617
I'm only familiar with one actor in this movie so I don't know anyone else,0.093496256
a frederick fair i believe is how you pronounce his name he plays this guy,0.23251508
at francis he's sitting on a bench with this older man and this woman played,0.19553843
by little dag / lil dag / that's right plays Jane and he says oh,0.10177781
that's my fiancee we've seen some crazy and he tells him the story so he's,0.3525517
probably the earliest unreliable narrator in horror and he tells a story about how you,0.1282824
know at some point in this past the carnival came to town and this strange,0.063373804
man came in and he had like an act with this um saamne bolused I,0.15544777
believe is how you pronounce it which is a sleepwalker played by conrad veidt also,0.14898156
from the man who laughs plays the sleepwalker named Caesar and dr. Caligari is played,0.100155964
by Werner crap werner krauss excuse me and basically the story is anyone that sort,0.8192412
of gives this doctor he pretty much hypnotizes or uses caesar to commit to go,0.14958745
out and kill them and the way it's done is it's beautifully done I would,0.91170675
say the score - this is better than nos bra to wear nos bra to,0.14960791
is more of like a gothic church organ even though I like that this score,0.36342403
seemed to fit a bit more and you know I had different tempos and went,0.12101797
with the film more and basically one of France's his friends named Alan is murdered,0.27910188
by Caesar so the more Francis looks into the murder you know the more we,0.42633379
find out about this dr. caligari in Caesar until eventually you know and I mean,0.07910347
it is a rather short film it's you know it's just over an hour like,0.09875009
an hour maybe 10 15 minutes the doctor sent Cesar after Jane in her sleep,0.13551706
what'd you get probably my favorite scene of the film which she's in her bedroom,0.1185876
and he he creeps up he wears like black leggings like a black turtleneck and,0.55318856
he has this weird like black diamond eye makeup everyone has weird ass makeup in,0.79564553
this movie especially dr. Caligari and just the way conrad veidt as caesar like approaches,0.09629866
her as she's sleeping with the knife and doesn't work he captures her but yeah,0.40316013
I did mean to pull up just some stills of the sets just so you,0.07562225
can I mean this is this is like a walkway as he's carrying Jane I,0.13797955
mean jagged walkways and god damnit let me close or even like streets which is,0.8578621
clearly like a wooden or cardboard set with all these weird strange lines one last,0.15645513
one the the scene of him and Jane's bedroom possibly the best personally my favorite,0.06506718
scene in the film and also on YouTube I saw it in the original print,0.03697551
so you get some black and white you get like the gold sepia tone you,0.30615744
get like the blue that you see a lot but one I've never seen before,0.1076534
because even now a two is like sepia or blue when he's in Jane's house,0.1004072
other than her bedroom it's like this weird purple and it seems like Jane's house,0.27427053
and even Francis's house is that's like when everything looks normal like the furniture is,0.045398384
an all Tim Burton jagged looking and that's why some film historians don't say it's,0.101224266
a prime example of German expressionist because there's a little bit of scenes that aren't,0.17120759
like I feel weird saying spoiler alert because this movie is 99 years old but,0.11922116
there was a twist ending that I did not see coming which is this dr.,0.05904236
Caligari is he's a director of this insane asylum and he was reading about you,0.5973408
know couple hundred years ago there was this doctor Caligari that used a saamne bolused,0.080342405
to carry out acts of murder named Caesar so he became obsessed and eventually a,0.29450932
patient who was a song SS came in and he sort of practiced on him,0.24003199
named him Caesar and sort of became the new doctor Caligari and so it's like,0.073111944
it's told in flashback from Francis's point of view but then we get to flashback,0.0645408
to calc Ahri's past and then like when the authorities capture Caligari and put him,0.11378449
away and we cut back to regular time you find out the guy that Frances,0.2790479
is talking to is another mental patient Jane is a mental patient Caesars a mental,0.5023942
patient and Frances is a mental patient and Caligari who now does not have makeup,0.31281736
is still a director of an asylum so it's like nothing I'm sure there's different,0.16432373
things you can take away from it but you know I just the depths of,0.10076815
madness that this movie is is insane I know another form of German Expressionists or,0.524453
another big aspect of it is harsh Authority like sort of interpreting harsh Authority you,0.21222448
know like Caligari and being like a madman Caesar sort of be in the German,0.6049404
soldier sleepwalking and there was this one guy who wrote a book called um Caligari,0.1436303
to hit saying how this film is like a premonition of Hitler some 13 years,0.37246576
later at least but I definitely look at it as I mean and even if,0.06309771
this is the first horror movie ever which I consider it to be it is,0.18135715
still a damn behind film silent movies even though I love old silent horror movies,0.662019
like family opera which I'll review at some point or not fraught - which I,0.05435675
have reviewed it it can be harder to watch because you know people are overacting,0.105989024
because silent films are you know in art form of body language but this movie,0.113798805
it the visual style the story the music even the title cards I mean the,0.052516747
title cards aren't just you know a black screen with text I mean it's just,0.23264322
weird fawn and some of them like when Caligari is Sanyo at the carnival step,0.10303316
right up ask Caesar your fortune at the bottom of the title card there'll be,0.087589875
like a shape like a cane sort of like how he's getting everyone's attention or,0.092614226
later on we're talking about murder at the bottom of the tunnel of cars it's,0.29482076
like a drawing of like a sharp object they really utilized the title cards which,0.088432334
even that I thought was very interesting you know like for example the title cards,0.06115336
are you know with we are backgrounds and shapes and fog and again how every,0.07251531
set doesn't there's no exterior shots it looks like a play like it's all cardboard,0.16825256
or particle board or something the fact that they paint shadows with black paint like,0.009212034
this movie really is like a nightmare or like a dream it is the most,0.24060054
surreal move well I mean you could also say Eraserhead is the most surreal horror,0.44266826
film but two totally different films it still it still is very surreal and very,0.06036016
dreamlike and of all the older horror movies that I've been watching lately this might,0.18564665
be one of my favorites and I would love to own it I would love,0.13975589
to you know especially find an Edition that has some features because I would love,0.07238777
to look into the making of this it was directed by Robert Wayne wine German,0.13153763
name but still just a simple story about a guy telling his story about he's,0.04074499
seen involving him and his fiancee about this crazy doctor with a sleepwalker that kills,0.63075584
people under his behest with twist after twist and just the most surreal again sounds,0.08418266
we were saying original about original set designs and music and just the way people,0.08230125
wear their makeup eaten that was another thing I noticed during the main events of,0.098934144
the film everyone has this weird makeup so you know when you see Caligari up,0.09512969
close he looks really creepy conrad veidt looks really creepy but then in present time,0.31089434
when we see where Francis is everyone looks normal but very haunting images I love,0.06983557
the set designs you know and again it's easy to see the influence it's it's,0.06156774
no surprise to me that next year this film is gonna be a hundred years,0.074540585
old and there's still people who are into it amazed by it and talk about,0.07703439
it I I wish I found this film earlier I loved the cabinet of dr.,0.076198645
Caligari it is the prime example of horror in the 20s and I was amazed,0.13363725
by you know the first ever horror film and I thought it was that good,0.15140595
even though I liked old horror movies anyway even that old but I thought it,0.15492202
was great I highly recommend it especially even if you're not into silent films or,0.2781506
necessarily old horror films in general if you are definitely check it out but even,0.15304352
if you're just into visually striking films that look like nothing you've ever seen before,0.27161464
definitely check it out so worth that I loved it this movie I was blown,0.21050644
away by it but that is 1920s the cabinet of dr. Caligari thank you for,0.08002938
