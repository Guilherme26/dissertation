a humungous cast of people and tells a story of the evacuation of 400 thousand,0.08117651
men in the middle of World War two who had every second are in danger,0.27526152
of being eliminated by the Germans and it's about how these men got off of,0.3042897
those shores the civilians that got in their own personal boats to travel there to,0.07185876
help them and the stories of these men trying to do everything they possibly can,0.094605245
to survive naturally I was excited for this movie I think most people who love,0.07535095
movies are because it's directed by Christopher Nolan and so obviously you're instantly thinking to,0.18504508
yourself okay at the very least this is going to be a magnificent spectacle and,0.15290186
Dunkirk utilizes real boats real planes real locations humongous amounts of extras to immerse you,0.15115155
in this moment to make you feel so completely taken over by it and it,0.053587202
works this movie is thrilling imagine Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor say what you want about,0.06162099
that movie it's not good but cut out the first like 90 minutes and the,0.12969321
film just starts with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the rest of the movie,0.10083042
is the attack and that's the whole film from the opening shot of Dunkirk you,0.31722337
are in it we're introduced to a few characters very quickly and then you are,0.063548185
instantaneously in this battle and it never lets up there's never a dull moment there's,0.13513471
never a scene where characters sit around a campfire and say who do you got,0.097100236
at home wait for you yeah my wife's pregnant I got a kid in school,0.30429476
well actually the school ain't there anymore cuz the Nazis blew it up Oh boohoo,0.34817702
there's never a moment like that you don't get those moments that you're so used,0.12175755
to seeing in war films and sometimes that can be a hindrance on the film,0.09185098
as well because my one major issue with this movie which doesn't detract from it,0.07370318
too much is that I didn't feel a specific connection with any one character like,0.057483558
I wanted to root for them or I connected with them emotionally in fact I,0.19489925
suppose who you might view as the audience character the one young person that you're,0.05627768
introduced to in the opening scene barely speaks a word for the first half of,0.08501533
the movie this movie is about the event it's about this evacuation of all of,0.081940986
these men it's about being in the middle of a horrific situation my buddy who,0.41486964
I saw the movie with Craig said it best he said when you are in,0.083366014
a situation like this you don't go hey my name is Ben no that's cool,0.0932684
my name is Kevin you know what do you like oh I don't know there's,0.090833664
bombs all over the place right now and I was just hoping we could have,0.5210056
a nice conversation this movie is in the moment and the way Noland Helms all,0.08860856
of these battle sequences it's what film was invented for everything on the screen looks,0.07987719
completely authentic there's never a moment that feels wasted there's not a scene that feels,0.11782077
misplaced and although it's very simplistic in its characterization its storytelling isn't and I don't,0.15438719
want to get into why because I feel that that would be spoiler territory but,0.09151181
there's a moment in this film where I saw a character in the nighttime and,0.057854418
I went wait a second I like the film is about an hour and 46,0.055519342
minutes which is very short for Noland and when I found that out I was,0.08286389
surprised by it but since the film begins in the battle and ends in the,0.042777497
battle and it's just a battle it's one gigantic sequence told in a very interesting,0.06461238
way and the runtime I think is perfect because if it had gone on any,0.14776409
longer I think would have outstayed its welcome if it was any shorter there wouldn't,0.067277275
have been enough impact the impact of this movie emotionally doesn't come from you going,0.10595289
I hope that that person makes it out of this situation so he can get,0.16905776
home to his family it comes from seeing this spectacle some might not like that,0.11721448
it is about the spectacle the aerial dogfights sequences with Tom Hardy whose eyeballs act,0.15031216
very well in this film that poor guy is always gonna wear a mask I,0.34874684
think and everything he's gonna have something over his face those dogfights are so riveting,0.40190724
and so white-knuckled because they look authentic the planes don't blow up in theatrical ways,0.33880642
the gunfire does not look like movie gunfire everything about it just feels so scarily,0.15029816
real that despite the fact that the characters aren't really given much set up and,0.029165188
this movie is 100% about this moment I was riveted from seeing one because I,0.105403334
felt like I was there Hans Zimmer's score once again something he does with Nolan,0.0861719
movies it's not so much melodical as it is almost sound design and I am,0.08412193
still playing these noises in my head and I will be purchasing the soundtrack and,0.22284657
I can't wait to hear it again if you go into Dunkirk expecting a one,0.098597355
two three four five straightforward narrative with characters with emotional arcs and big moments where,0.04360684
they explode with incredible dialogue you're not going to get that this movie as I,0.3212665
said is very simplistic but it's also highly realistic people die in war and sometimes,0.29970548
people die alone terrified having no idea what's going on and does that person get,0.44045588
an amazing arc or is someone there to tell them everything's going to be okay,0.10485833
not always and this film doesn't shy away from showing that yes there's not too,0.06989803
much blood it's pg-13 there are no limbs flying around there's no intense gruesome imagery,0.27008775
but it's the psychological impact on all of the characters involved with this movie that,0.10909419
make it so frightening because you're witnessing characters who are so horrified by what they're,0.15204595
seeing or by what they feel could happen to them they are all desperately clawing,0.15321039
to get out and the ones who are trying to go in to help you,0.08255847
also feel for them the whole film captures this event so beautifully that it's tough,0.05310326
to really pinpoint any magnificently huge flaws beyond the fact that the characters are lacking,0.08499609
I'm gonna give Dunkirk an a excellent war films like Saving Private Ryan are about,0.14686123
characters in a horrible situation they're about seeing these people react to war Dunkirk is,0.13367966
just about war and how horrific aliy terrifying it can be when you're stuck in,0.18674564
the middle of it and it's definitely worth seeing see it on the biggest screen,0.107385546
