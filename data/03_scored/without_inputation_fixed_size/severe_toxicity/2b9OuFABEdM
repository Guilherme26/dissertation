hi I'm an angel and today I will be reviewing the 2018 thriller a quiet,0.07064317
place this is John Krasinski's directorial debut you may know him as Jim Halpert from,0.038546726
the office that's how I know him and I was really surprised directorial debut and,0.020037992
we're going for a horror thriller really I was kind of hoping that his directorial,0.12947267
debut would be threat level midnight - but you know so a quiet place what,0.08019254
did I think I want to see in the movies I don't usually see who,0.07318085
are movies in the cinema because scary you know and if you're like me and,0.032439675
you're pretty chicken and vulnerable I'm gonna say you may not like the movie going,0.27324486
experience so so much but it's a good movie not just horror movie good movie,0.04620698
it's a fun movie to go see in the cinema but be careful if you,0.057339497
have a cough try not to call if you have popcorn or crunchy food or,0.03388645
anything that crinkles and cracks you will be singled out I went with a bag,0.22496773
of popcorn I always sneak in my own food and I just realized in the,0.043561548
cinema how noisy it was so I ate like all of it during the previews,0.13569547
just to make sure that I wouldn't make any noise during the movie it's not,0.024633082
a completely silent movie but it is pretty quiet so you do want to respect,0.046551548
the movie-going experience maintain the ambiance of silence when it is demanded plus if you,0.13977636
get sucked into the movie which happens pretty easily because the story is well schooled,0.3232296
and well portrayed you're gonna hold your breath often and I had my coat over,0.18701771
my face there are jump scares there are quite a few I thought some of,0.07562938
them were kind of useless I'm just gonna say raccoon I think you know what,0.2467109
I mean if you saw the movie that was kind of annoying they kind of,0.1299689
emphasized the jumps with sound and music and loud bangs and strings of hits whatever,0.1030895
not necessary I often talk about how these jump scares and horror movies are cheap,0.103144705
movie tricks to get people to get scared but your story should be scary enough,0.043129843
or you can't have a jump scare but it doesn't have to be so emphasized,0.05710668
with useless sounds that wouldn't be there in the real circumstance you know what I,0.11070984
mean for example I hate it in horror movies especially monster horror movies when there's,0.26850644
a mom and it's making all this sound and somebody's hiding from it and all,0.06308934
of a sudden it's really really quiet right and then the person either turns around,0.05453242
opens the door or does something and the monsters right there and they go back,0.09154723
and there's like a huge sound but it's like weren't you just noisy this whole,0.113763034
time you were coming down the stairs like yeah like in the walking dead too,0.38966155
you know it'll be like the monsters go when they walk they are not inconspicuous,0.19638216
and yet there be a moment where everybody's just in the woods in the silence,0.08793595
of nature all pretty and all of a sudden they get in a psych I,0.20252714
really dislike it when movies do that and luckily this movie doesn't do that the,0.019155959
monster here I think it's an alien is safe to say it's pretty freakin noisy,0.44174418
all the time and they don't really have those moments of not noisiness which is,0.01573758
weird because apparently they're really sensitive to noise and they don't like noises yeah they,0.026539497
are so noisy like what is wrong with you you're like a broken car or,0.25536442
something if you see the trailer you know what the story's about it sets it,0.015093017
up pretty directly you know it's post-apocalyptic monster ville few families survive must be quiet,0.1642578
the monsters are sensitive to noise so they will hear you so you got to,0.082133554
live in an ultra quiet world which is not how this earth this world is,0.06769308
built babies come out the womb crying you know so we're kind of made to,0.33151546
make noise speaking of babies they integrated that into the movie of course mama has,0.20135242
a pregnancy and has to give birth in this world now you could say birth,0.11808007
alone pregnancy that's enough to make a horror movie right it's pretty gruesome and painful,0.22474602
and awful and there's a lot of screaming involved so you don't need much more,0.077684134
but add on top of that creepy monsters creeping on you looking to kill you,0.72140574
maybe feast on your baby like a Big Mac horror thriller suspense and they did,0.3116322
it well these kind of movies you don't usually get an exploration of the situation,0.030251887
or in they'll just throw you into a post-apocalyptic world with certain characteristic people have,0.34222087
to accommodate to a new style of life but you don't get to explore that,0.028257001
concept you don't get to see what it would look like in a day to,0.032915283
day of somebody living in this type of world but here we do and I,0.19808504
really appreciated that we get to see them live in a world without shoes first,0.08549805
of all I'm out come on really no shoes like not even espadrilles or ballet,0.0545118
slippers can be really stealthy a great idea is to pour sand all over the,0.083812475
place two five full sounds crunching of leaves when you walk on floor branches cracking,0.044205446
whatever luckily for them this alien cannot see but in here's so they have lightbulbs,0.05900312
and flashlights and triggering things clever and in this kind of world the families that,0.13982625
survive are obviously the families that learn sign language before all of this hits so,0.035327904
huge advantage to having that skill in the back pocket you got to know how,0.049968597
to soundproof a room you got to know how are you gonna do when a,0.026634619
baby comes because the babies cry and they thought of this and all that and,0.12363968
it's what it was really interesting I just appreciated that side of things the fleshing,0.04092875
out of a concept and not just okay situation a horror movie run from monster,0.09483257
you know which we get all the time John Krasinski plays opposite his real-life wife,0.115352154
II emily Blunt's and oh my gosh their chemistry is so real so lived-in there's,0.048206523
an intimate scene between the two that felt so natural and thick like thicker than,0.048944212
Pam and Jim you know and I never thought that I would ever say that,0.024056366
because I live for pen and Jim but after seeing this I was like okay,0.044049792
I forgive you Jim for not marrying Pam in real life I get it you,0.15841947
two so cute it's uh speaking of the cast everybody did a fantastic job the,0.07926129
eldest daughter has a lot of complexity in her acting her facial expressions are layered,0.12722236
I really appreciated it kids can easily come off as OneNote actors in movies but,0.108626485
in this case all kids really played their part so yeah like I said this,0.09441816
is a good movie a good thriller a good suspense good building and so much,0.083875
so that when there are scenes with music I was tense I was like should,0.027455455
you be listening to an iPod right now like I don't know what if you,0.104726516
miss something your ears are busy and you don't hear the sound of a crate,0.061826825
falling in the backyard and now you gotta prepare because monsters are coming so they,0.1796488
did a good job at making this world believable and immersive like there's the scene,0.08037081
with a river I got so tense I was like I don't know about this,0.045374837
I was like the kid character in that scene I don't know that there's that,0.041742936
much more to say without spoiling it so I'm going to transition into the spoiler,0.0927113
segment I'm just gonna wrap it up by saying if you like horror movies or,0.21667759
thrillers more with suspense no blood there's like almost no blood in this movie so,0.100722104
really that's also a huge plus if you like movies that really have a good,0.04775553
story and science fictiony and that are well thought out science fiction stories if you,0.0097815255
like monster movies or I would even say if you don't like monster movies I,0.20475483
don't like monster movies I've mentioned this in another review I prefer a movie that,0.09748399
leaves more to the imagination when it comes to scariness but this monster is actually,0.16597663
scary-looking interesting to look at well-conceived I would say obviously people have said that it,0.034640104
looks like a demo Gorgon from stranger things which it really does but to me,0.044112984
it also looks like an artichoke and I tried to eat one of those and,0.08461335
it almost killed me so it's not so far-fetched to have an artichoke as a,0.32514706
monster they sharp I just recommend this movie go see with a bunch of friends,0.16923203
in the cinema so they can appease you when things get jumpy or watch it,0.046197005
at home either way I encourage people to go out and watch this movie it's,0.039267123
a good movie and talk about an ending well you want to get up and,0.046212967
praise I wanted more though it ends a bit prematurely to me it's like oh,0.06970792
my gosh I want to keep going with this maybe it could have continued into,0.071092166
the credits but they ended it in a classy way you know you don't want,0.032294
to give people too much or too little but it would have been fun kind,0.063457854
of like Dawn of the Dead I think it is where the story kind of,0.21384656
continues and the credits and you get a little bit of an alternate ending if,0.11800624
you will oh yes finally I remember and this movie gave me a huge I,0.042571753
am Legend vibes so if you also liked that kind of movie you'll enjoy this,0.052079223
okay it's time to transition into these spoilers so I'm just gonna say before you,0.12867047
go like this video subscribe to music game news and thanks for watching whoo spoil,0.123886466
alright let's talk about this movie a place mmm the crazy dude in the woods,0.21387118
okay unpack this with me because I didn't really understand and we had like a,0.044507436
discussion with a group of people I went to see but still I didn't think,0.02877651
it was very clear here's my interpretation of it Jim and baby Ryan filleth I,0.070084415
mean he really looks like Ryan Phillips Oh walking through the woods and they come,0.06121685
across a dude and a dead woman and this dude kind of looks cray he,0.3512705
looks like he's about to snap looks like it's about to scream and he does,0.09947755
and then blah blah blah you know what happens monster comes to claim that booty,0.22608818
I thought it was a murder-suicide I think this person went crazy living in this,0.449973
world it'll play on a person psychology it's almost inevitable so he made sense for,0.04848191
me to see this person as someone who snaps and he took his wife's life,0.29258966
or daughter I think wife and then he was ready to take his own life,0.25701854
because he couldn't live under the constant pressure or fear of not making it through,0.041709676
tomorrow someone else said that maybe the monster killed his wife and he came across,0.48799947
her and then he just screamed out of the shock of it all the fear,0.11848584
you know hitting him I don't know she just wasn't disfigured enough and we didn't,0.2924337
linger enough on the body for us to really analyze the situation but she wasn't,0.05921132
worn up enough to be like oh yeah this was done by an alien and,0.10551342
not just a dude with a knife but if you got a good look at,0.22891624
her body I just tried not to look cuz I don't want to see her,0.11749738
corpse did you notice maybe the way she was killed would give an indication as,0.4240842
to how she met her end okay let's talk about the birth scene because that,0.034143876
was intense for so many reasons first off someone had a group of people I,0.12124036
went to see the movie with said that the star of this movie is that,0.025421988
nail on the stairs all you can think about is that nail as Merson at,0.028542366
the end when the daughter's about to come down the stairs and she wasn't looking,0.10663958
at mama when mama said watch out for the nail so you thought oh she's,0.11535681
gonna trip on it too and scream yes so that nails very clever touch but,0.0661412
really does she have to like pull on that bag that was kind of a,0.06274411
stretch you would think in a world where you have to be uber careful if,0.046046674
you are carrying a load of laundry and it snags on something you're gonna stop,0.15123083
you're gonna go down carefully you're going to carefully unhook it and be on your,0.15036277
way not pull on it and maybe dislodge something I don't know I would think,0.063360736
splinter not nail but even a splinter it's pretty darn painful it was a stretch,0.35037482
but fine movie magic right so momma punctures her foot oh she had to swallow,0.45336545
that because the demagogue ins was right there then she makes her way to the,0.031209087
tub and the thing is coming up the stairs like it is right there we,0.055766337
see it right there meanwhile kid is going to explode them fireworks right when Jim,0.31925476
said go get the Rockets though I thought they were referring to the spaceship because,0.02426723
that thing makes a lot of noise right and I was like oh shoot the,0.17634352
Sun is gonna go to find the rocket that the daughter brought to the burial,0.0950441
site but he's not gonna find it and that's gonna be a whole plot twist,0.044198126
but it made more sense to go in the direction that they went in to,0.015218072
have fireworks that the kid can light and run away from so that it gives,0.03578289
him time to be away from the loudness so yeah we're with Mama in the,0.09518977
tub and she screams and then we see the fireworks explode and I was a,0.13359216
bit confused because they made it look like the explosion happened right after she screamed,0.117117554
now if I'm the monster and I'm hunting I'm looking for food some people said,0.070841394
that they don't eat their kill they just kill it was written somewhere I didn't,0.6208537
see that written anywhere so I'm thinking they're snacking I hear a scream I am,0.055357914
one foot maybe from that scream from that snack then I hear a bigger North,0.054488517
in the distance now I know that I got two snacks it's an it logical,0.022227112
for the monster to first address the first noise it has come across since it's,0.131566
like right there even if it's not the snack on the minutes just to stop,0.052729107
noises wouldn't it make more sense for them the monster to be like you know,0.18572193
what let me deal with this mess first before I put out that fire so,0.102237396
what they could have done instead was that she could have screamed and they could,0.056343716
have played the fireworks audio at the exact same time and then cut to it,0.044057775
so that we understand that her screaming was maybe muffled by the sound of the,0.046330042
firework but the firework wasn't so close to the house though that it would drown,0.18532749
out the sounds of a mother in you know what I mean you go with,0.07299459
it and that's another thing we see them in the pharmacy early on mama you,0.071331635
guys thought of everything but you didn't think of grabbing them birth control pills you,0.12777579
live near the pharmacy when we see them on day 89 it is you know,0.07421587
they already kind of figured out how to live in this world or they're still,0.03648333
figuring it out and now we're at day 472 or something so you've had time,0.072167106
to consider that you're in this world and maybe having a baby isn't a good,0.15658489
idea but maybe that was their executive decision we're gonna have a kid we're gonna,0.027702238
take the biggest risk of all time what we're gonna create a soundproof studio in,0.038961135
the basement I don't know that a rickety old wooden house is the best place,0.08664416
to hide but maybe that's all they had on hand I don't know it's probably,0.02756255
their home you know so it makes sense fine oh my god that scene when,0.050443538
she is sleeping and she wakes up to the sound of waters first of all,0.049694538
you're like ah spa day but no she's knee-deep in water and her baby's crib,0.17685902
is afloat and the monsters in the corner now when I saw that I was,0.060765192
like oh oh my god I was convinced that that monster just had a happy,0.1903077
meal and that baby was snacked upon Oh luckily oh that was not the case,0.07560544
and she had to summon all of her courage to save that baby and the,0.06846003
way she sank it to that impromptu waterfall reminded me of the way Homer Simpson,0.09744608
sunk into those bushes can we talk about the baby dying at beginning oh he,0.2143501
was so cute adorable little kid that really shook everybody in the audience I mean,0.098731875
if you watch the trailer you see it coming though right I didn't think that,0.015913853
Jim could outrun that monster because that's what they do in movies right the human,0.2670484
usually outrun something that you clearly see it cannot outrun but here they kept it,0.021914475
realistic no there was no way it was gonna outrun that monster that baby was,0.2571667
snatched and it was a good way to set the tone I think very early,0.01982979
on set the tone for the movie so now you know what the stakes are,0.019238442
you know it was very clever right and then later on oh my goodness I,0.05004509
actually shed a tear when Jim dies and then you're left thinking what if his,0.15834963
wife didn't give him that speech about you got to protect him because what the,0.041315887
hell are we doing here if we can't at least protect our kids if she,0.23300216
didn't tell him that maybe he would have been in that moment life okay let's,0.03594852
see what we have a new one we did lose that one I could go,0.040635403
and make sure that the new one is taken care of do I really want,0.0203932
to do this right now like I mean these kids are kind of annoying sue,0.22927573
maybe I should just let them all get in and continue in this world's freest,0.12841703
bird it would be a lot easier yes I know could I live with it,0.04365667
and I kind of thought it would have been hilarious if he had let that,0.044029173
monster eat his kids and he had to snuck away come back knowing that mama,0.48725715
is watching them on the screen the whole time oh honey I'm so sorry I,0.036611043
I couldn't find the kids so look in the morning okay we just go to,0.023356594
bed okay knowing that that nail is there and not telling him but then that,0.09951081
would have just been like a Tyler Perry movie this movie even had kind of,0.109556414
a Marvel feel right with that earpiece that goes berserk every time the monsters get,0.09273325
close which that I didn't really understand does this monster itself emit some kind of,0.13214672
a radio frequency or wave that interfered with the ear piece every time I would,0.057415325
get close to it because it didn't just mess up randomly it only messed up,0.037928108
when the monsters were closed so clearly and had something to do with what they,0.07283694
do when they open up their face their ear their artichoke lamp oh and when,0.1011139
she turned it off in that truck oh the audience audible gasps it was just,0.036232553
like no girl you are the superhero you are that's why I was so excited,0.18924275
when we get to the end and Mama is figuring it out and you just,0.06861037
want to scream it at her like piece it together girl this is your scooby-doo,0.2604085
moment figure it out finally she gets it and we get this badass ending pardon,0.24142691
my language but badass gotta say it with momma and daughter click click okay baby,0.34567878
let's get in formation and they slay and that's why I was so disappointed that,0.25154254
they ended it there I wanted to see the slight edge and they could have,0.019936219
put some Beyonce on and just pull pull pull pop yeah yeah did I thought,0.1033263
that it could have been okay to be fair that's Missy Elliott but that would,0.020114489
have worked so you know what I'm saying I'm better I'm better I'm better get,0.019477243
him get him get him and play that in the credits while they are just,0.03685317
cleaning house just saying so there probably won't be a sequel because it was a,0.056841273
really nicely tightly made movie ended with a bow it was about the quiet place,0.047032475
I don't know how they could continue unless they do a sequel with a new,0.13075049
family somewhere else in the u.s. also dealing with this in another original way maybe,0.050320476
we live in this very sequel eyes era where every movie needs a sequel and,0.10643736
sometimes it's nice to just have a story have the end at the end of,0.025982073
it and be beautiful and great as it is no sequel no screw-ups after just,0.117367
a beautiful crepe dash of cinnamon perfect I really didn't expect to appreciate this movie,0.064711064
as much as I did but I really did and I would love to know,0.04423937
what did you think of a quiet place let us all know in the comment,0.020057948
