Pixar itself must be a bundle of emotions as the animation studio tries to reclaim,0.09118427
its former glory you're watching beyond the trailers review of inside out I'm joy this,0.12880673
is sadness that's anger yeah this is disgust and that's fear we're Riley's emotions these,0.19859977
are rice memories they're mostly happy you'll notice not drag I wanted to maybe hold,0.10258316
more what happened sadness she did something to the memory is everything okay Thank You,0.059606846
Pat Joey great joy no the core memories can I say that curse word now,0.4661872
yes ironically the studio which claimed it would never make a sequel got sidetracked by,0.09639108
them in fact Pixar has a dicey history with sequels as it was the threat,0.1489212
of making Toy Story 2 without them that force then-fledgling animation studio to stay in,0.18427292
business with Disney even though the two companies weren't getting along eventually in 2006 Disney,0.04375883
fully acquired Pixar and even though Pixar insisted it was still semi-autonomous it became sequel,0.10207435
centric after the acquisition Toy Story 3 Cars 2 monsters University and coming soon finding,0.15311876
dory Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2 the box office numbers for these sequels,0.062366888
are pretty impressive with Toy Story 3 Pixar's most successful film ever but their new,0.06495155
focus on sequels has cost Pixar some of its prestige allowing its step-sibling Disney Animation,0.096723475
to make some big moves frozen in big hero 6 not only dominated at the,0.15108627
box office but also won the last two Best Animated Feature Oscars in fact frozen,0.05711741
surpassed Toy Story 3 to become the most successful animated film of all time but,0.07186487
while Pixar set out 2014 Disney Animation is sitting out 2015 giving Pixar just the,0.053463686
opening they need they're releasing two original films this year the good dinosaur for Thanksgiving,0.10469229
and this summer inside out and true Pixar fashion inside out is an ambitious project,0.105807856
that hopes to be both intellectual and mainstream ironically calling to mind some of the,0.117964655
classic animated shorts from friendly competitor Disney Animation on how the mind and body work,0.17965233
and let's not forget that the sitcom Herman's head already laid the groundwork for this,0.18862589
idea as well speaking of television inside add is a little light on star power,0.06643808
for a Pixar film going with mostly TV talent there's former Saturday Night Live performers,0.05541422
Amy Poehler and Bill Hader the offices Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling now over on,0.042628027
Hulu with the Mindy project books Comedy Central's Lewis Black and alas who would seem,0.0061919694
that even here sequel itis is at work as Pixar already has a short plan,0.13891883
for the blu-ray release of inside out entitled Riley's first date but everyone might be,0.08333712
able to relate to being highly emotional well these personified versions of emotions ironically keep,0.077249646
us for making an emotional connection with Riley herself so inside out is an interesting,0.14881104
case because while I think it succeeds wildly as an introduction to psychology 101 I,0.09892687
think it fails miserably as a film now this is my non-spoiler review my spoiler,0.3501926
review will also go up today so I'm going to try and explain what I,0.07025845
mean by that without giving anything away about the film and I guess the crux,0.05060061
of my argument is that this is a message first an entertainment second and with,0.05720429
filmmaking it's supposed to do the other way around basically inside-out swaps it's a and,0.10391112
B storylines but even worse than that I mean that implies still some kind of,0.14348912
structure and inside out is is out of control creatively as the emotions in Riley's,0.054461718
head and logic isn't just missing from the filmmaking process here but from the movie,0.06116472
itself literally yes while I was watching inside out I was like something's missing here,0.08547459
this isn't a complete picture of the human mind I just I couldn't put my,0.14426857
finger on it I was like this is not a complete picture so I thought,0.15601504
about and I thought about it and I just couldn't crack it so I was,0.105895236
googling emotions I was like what are they give me the list of emotions because,0.07574986
I know that someone's absent and lo and behold I found an article talking about,0.12517042
inside out and how they had originally intended to have a sixth emotion in Riley's,0.048512015
head and that would be logic and I was like Eureka it was a really,0.06673891
bad idea to cut logic out of this movie because emotions are governed by logic,0.13110785
and I think the logic could have represented Riley heck more than represented her I,0.15062717
think it should have been Riley inside her own head you know the voice in,0.25866717
our head when we're kind of like when we talk to ourselves we're thinking things,0.08225004
through because Riley was really absent from her own persona which made it very difficult,0.09228115
difficult to not only emotionally connect with the character but the film itself there just,0.051905885
was this detachment and I think it's like you know the really popular idea of,0.09787519
an angel and a devil on your shoulder right which is I guess kind of,0.48975125
like the origin of this idea this idea evolved from that but the fun thing,0.10080422
about the angel and the devil on your shoulders is that you talk to them,0.48667684
they talk to you there's a dialogue you are wrestling with your emotions as I,0.16931385
said logic governs emotions but here the angel and the devil are talking amongst themselves,0.31089434
and you are just left out and I think that ultimately doesn't ring true as,0.08776316
representative of who we are I mean we all we all are emotional but we,0.071167134
are that's not all we are right there there's like a I guess a soul,0.06928516
missing like emotions are reactionary what was where is the driving force of Riley that,0.051639993
wasn't in the film and when we're not we're not all Yeager's controlled by an,0.11233926
argumentative team of five desperately in need of a team-building exercise now that said uh,0.059563328
what I think is the fatal flaw of the film I still did enjoy a,0.109564565
number of elements in the movie for instance I'm again no spoilers here but I,0.049781747
really liked the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film they were brilliant and,0.04723056
I was very happy I was like who looks like I'm gonna like this film,0.23282947
after all and then it just totally fell apart I'd say when joy and sadness,0.08269054
start their little road trip again I don't want to give anything away that's when,0.06883159
the movie starts to go off the rails but the beginning of the film is,0.054758914
excellent Pixar at its best and I think when you start watching this movie if,0.078636676
you haven't already you'll be like that grace is crazy this movie's great and then,0.4031043
you'll be like oh yeah it is it is kind of boring more on that,0.472987
in a moment now I also really liked the world-building which I think does good,0.068272516
a job as possible when trying to depict such a complex and difficult and abstract,0.064384595
subject as the human mind I also like the world-building of San Francisco but that,0.11087417
was very well done - I thought it was very well realized so I liked,0.05656715
that I also liked the animation you know we talked recently about the good dinosaur,0.17208976
and how the animation looks really wonky there with the dinosaurs but here this was,0.18634443
classic Pixar everything was beautifully realized in the mind and in the real world but,0.14239778
the best of all was by far and away joy joy is offense pastic character,0.15296616
i love how she glows I love little pixelation of her skin and Amy Poehler,0.3056627
to such a wonderful and nuanced job providing her voice and I also thought the,0.071642265
expressiveness of joy was really good it was just it was the full package that,0.067149274
character more than anybody else in the movie just really came together I was like,0.06425087
that's a winner and then I also like Riley even though I think that Riley,0.074600026
because I want to get to know her better but what was very odd about,0.0841157
Riley and this occurred to me after I watched the film was that really is,0.028198387
like not emotionally where she should be as a tween she actually I think had,0.2418046
the emotional capacity and maturity of like a six or seven year old and I,0.12001544
don't want to give anything away that's you could imply that's part of the message,0.07893874
of the film but she just seemed um you know a little bit not developed,0.17441928
enough for the age that she was supposed to be in the film and I,0.072082534
think that also made it hard to emotionally connect because she didn't seem like a,0.1823565
real fully realized character I mean I know the joy had to be uh but,0.07562411
I think that Riley needed to be as well and cuz it just kind of,0.05438983
created the idea that joy was Riley and I'm like wait a minute are you,0.108680375
saying I'm not my own self I just again I applaud Pixar for trying to,0.11350244
depict the human mind no easy task and I think that they gave it a,0.1513634
decent shot but all the dots don't connect I'd also say that I think this,0.3023583
is not a good film for children why well I think that the messages of,0.11819333
the film won't be appreciated by children I think they're a little bit too adult,0.32703367
I also think the middle of the film is just downright as I said boring,0.1816947
I mean they're gonna be like I'm super bored I mean I was like oh,0.065648824
man maybe I should like go get another snack from the concession stand like I,0.16903214
was really like oh I'm not having a good time and then also it wouldn't,0.051719528
be a Pixar movie if someone didn't commit suicide ah pics aw you just can't,0.21593206
help yourself we'll talk about that more in the spoiler review so at the end,0.06196287
of the day I guess I have to say that inside out is certainly on,0.071174555
provement on some of the films that Pixar has been making lately but at the,0.12349357
end of the day they're just a little bit too inside their own heads on,0.46948558
this one alright that's my non-spoiler review I look forward to talking about the movie,0.06335456
with you down below in the comments this is the non-spoiler review so don't put,0.24094753
any spoilers in there and then also there is a contest from channel frederator which,0.066896826
