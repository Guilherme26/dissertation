the Irishman directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and of course a huge cast of others the Irishman is the story of an ol mobster who is basically recounting the tales of his past and his possible involvement in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa,0.29427582
so this is a movie first of all my of a friend of mine,0.12635925
he's doing his best of the decade films and he's challenged me and a bunch of other like-minded movie lovers to present our best of Latinos which was a cut it down to maybe 50 maximum 30 for the decade,0.30721676
so the Irishman of course is a movie that I had to see before I closed off my list,0.14018221
and the reason I bring that up is I'm not the hugest fan of gangster films but the pedigree behind this movie and what this movie was trying to pull off technologically speaking and that sort of thing I absolutely had to see it,0.2354702
so let's get into what I thought of it and I'll start with the visual,0.085431755
and when I speak of in SeaWorld's of course I'm talking about the look of this film in terms of the irid us,0.09193975
it look authentic to that time period,0.11289392
I think it's like the probably forties fifties sixties that sort of thing this time period we're dealing with,0.07163326
and I said of course it does you know this is Martin Scorsese he doesn't leave anything to chance with stuff like that you know he's a stickler for those types of details,0.26616988
so it film definitely has that look to it,0.07495384
and if you're a fan of his work I think you'd be really happy with what he did here like his other films it's not just about the costumes that the characters are wearing or details,0.08822908
like that,0.051297788
oh he has thousands of but it's the entire neighborhood and in locations that this stuff is shot in and that it's authentic to the time period it's in,0.10753951
and I think they did a really good job with that because you definitely get sucked into that immediately as soon as flashbacks weekend,0.6842043
you know I was actually as I started watching you guys instantly like what period is this,0.35821944
you know so it does look authentic to that period and then of course there's the technology behind this movie done by um ILM and it's DD aging of these actors you know,0.117637806
I think it's really just done on these three actors Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and for the most I would say it's well done,0.17305192
I mean what they managed to pull off here,0.119387515
we've been seeing this sort of thing before of course,0.09835878
we've seen it before with Marvel and everybody but we've never seen this type of movie use,0.105176836
this type of technology,0.11239464
usually they use practical effects you know,0.066353776
but this this is something where they needed to take 30 years off discard,0.058916233
there's maybe 40 years of the the ages of the actors and I think especially with um I would say with Joe Pesci I think they did a really good job Alice,0.077344
well now when I get to Robert De Niro for me um there were more months where I would get that feelings like if you play video games you know what I'm talking about as good as this stuff can look,0.057061654
and it really looks amazing here to get like wrinkles and laugh lines and all of that stuff in there the eyes there's something about the eyes that can be kind of dead,0.24689454
and I seen a lot with a robot's character Frank the Irishman Sharon,0.060514387
I see it,0.066803865
they,0.029486267
I don't know if it's because of the blue eyes that it stands out a bit more on him than it does on Joe Pesci and that sort of thing but it did pull me out time to time,0.1522292
when that would happen when I would get like a full on a long shot of his face,0.5882594
and I just be focusing on those eyes and it would just be like something is off it just seems like,0.095893316
there's nothing behind,0.114610836
those eyes you know but it didn't happen often and the performances themselves are so good that I could let that go and I'll get into the performances,0.14964752
now the acting which of course,0.057861764
I think I feel like everybody of brings their a-game to this you know because they're working with Scorsese they're gonna want to bring their best,0.11886945
and these are actors who for the most have not really been doing amazing work there,0.15186118
these are men with Stella Stella filmography of course but in recent years it's been,0.09054611
so so it's been a little crazy,0.49314967
I mean opportunist showed up in jackandjill of all things but here I thought that you could see that passion for what they were doing come back and that especially goes for me without Pacino his performance was the performance that kind of woke me up because there was a point where um which I mean Joe Pesci Robert De Niro of course these guys are fantastic together but I was just kind of watching the movie like okay,0.119413994
yeah,0.040847696
this is good I'm enjoying this this is fine this is alright and then Al Pacino comes on as Jimmy Hoffa,0.066806264
and I sit up there's like a renewed energy when he's on screen and my interest is piqued and I'm just sucked into anything any conversations that include him,0.36549005
so I just feel like he was a little bit above he went above and beyond and he maybe maybe he was more invested a little more passionate about what he would if I had to give the award for the best actor for this movie in particular I would get it,0.07575919
in,0.02693567
my opinion,0.05772566
he's amazing yes Jimmy Hoffa but that does not speak ill of Joe Pesci or Robert De Niro and Joe please against type,0.1128118
in this search is so kind of insane to see you know,0.42139697
he he's the one who usually goes,0.07960899
you know batshit crazy and it was kind of nice to see a version of him playing a version of a character who's a lot more stoic a character who you know he doesn't let his emotions just fly off the handle so to speak,0.715718
I don't mad about this character,0.18217936
actually I like that a lot,0.05548009
I always feel like you know it's -,0.08305275
should I say predictable to have like a mob boss who's always like having a temper tantrum and beating somebody to death and all that sort of thing I always find you know any movies or,0.5380458
television series that covered these types of characters mob bosses or drug traffickers whatever you know that kind of thing is to see unintelligence to those characters that makes sense to me because if you live in kind of life I mean you have to be pretty smart to stay alive so I I enjoyed that aspect of what you was doing as well story-wise this movie I mean it's based on a book,0.20181896
I think the name of the book is so I hear you paint houses or so I heard you paint houses and that - basically means so I know you're a hip man that's other things just kind of pretty,0.19278829
cool I'm pretty messed up I've never read the,0.12406553
book but the story here is riveting enough that I mean most of us you know you may have heard the name Jimmy,0.06192927
Hoffa you know he disappeared but that was about the extent of my,0.08526975
knowledge,0.028683323
and when you hear jokes about he's sleeping with the fishes and that sort of thing but to really get into this and see that character and his family and his friends are not sort of thing it was it was entertaining,0.14108805
I was intriguing to watch,0.07798694
and that's another element of this movie that I'd quite like because as massive as a spoon is in terms of scale and budget this feels like it's the story of three men like it almost feels like this could be an independent film that focuses on three personalities three characters and their friendships and how you try to sustain loyalty and friendship in a will like that we are eliminating somebody's,0.11338218
you know taking somebody's life is just considered a business transaction,0.14685264
I just found that was the most compelling aspect of this movie for me was that friendship and and how that affected them,0.05762113
and their families are not life that they were living in other than that this movie for me is a bit of a slog,0.2406736
it's really long I did feel that time crunch,0.12090652
you know I wouldn't say I was bored,0.092254065
but I definitely was like whoo,0.06986209
this is still happening,0.06043949
this is still going that sort of thing I did have moments where I felt,0.082844876
I got watching this movie another aspect of this film for me that was a negative was the young,0.14796256
this is old know by that I mean these actors are they're not being replaced by younger,0.2300388
actors like what used to be done in past films,0.1486546
you know I do it,0.07524957
they were hire young the person to portray Robert De Niro or Ikki Fred Frank the Irishman that sort of thing,0.083864026
these are these actors at their age which I guess is their 70s or what however will they are right,0.107457064
now playing 40 year versions of themselves,0.07731855
and the problem with that is whenever they have to be physical or anything like that it gets a little wonky,0.24896757
I'll give you guys an example and I'll try not to be too spoilery,0.192626
there's a scene where Frank has is beating up a guy for doing something,0.3962224
you know he's offended him and it's so awkward guys um,0.3884416
it doesn't look big everything about that scene looks really awkward,0.21130188
it looks weird,0.14519522
it looks like the guy's just lying on the floor and he kicks don't even really look like they're landing properly,0.45765534
I don't know if it's technology like trying to make him look young in the moment why he's doing that it just looks like an old dude with a young face beating up someone,0.5841821
so the movements are still fun,0.05730033
I want key and it doesn't look natural at all,0.15013973
and I see that too sometimes with how they stand or how they sit and get up you can see this edge behind not so to speak you know that they're trying to move like younger men but you know it's not that easy to do,0.097278856
so it's weird,0.15513851
it's weird to see somebody you know with this young face,0.34207627
but the energy of an older person it doesn't quite work,0.113360904
and it does make for some awkward moments here and there that just feels stiff but overall guys this is this is a good movie,0.07541827
you know,0.07163658
I would not speak,0.10113755
ill of this movie,0.14982194
I would definitely say watch it,0.09987306
and it's available on Netflix now,0.029447641
so if you have a Netflix account you can definitely check this out if you haven't seen it in cinemas,0.07039816
that's how I watched it this weekend and I'm gonna give the Irishman a seven and a half out of ten I know a lot of people are there singing praises to this movie rightfully,0.12460084
so for me like I said answer phones not my forte,0.15912154
it's not something I really get into but as a character piece I absolutely enjoyed those aspects of this movie I enjoyed the characters I enjoyed seeing how their world works so to speak,0.08884323
and if realism behind this film as well you know I have to give it points for that so for me personally it's a seven and a half out the time but it's a definite win and it's a definite must-see of a film and that's gonna be it for this guy,0.094269454
