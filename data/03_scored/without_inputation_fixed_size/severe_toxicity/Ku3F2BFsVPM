the Irishman directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino,0.032254755
and of course a huge cast of others the Irishman is the story of an,0.023871446
ol mobster who is basically recounting the tales of his past and his possible involvement,0.22334926
in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa so this is a movie first of all my,0.041109014
of a friend of mine he's doing his best of the decade films and he's,0.039845165
challenged me and a bunch of other like-minded movie lovers to present our best of,0.10789611
Latinos which was a cut it down to maybe 50 maximum 30 for the decade,0.3400212
so the Irishman of course is a movie that I had to see before I,0.036454726
closed off my list and the reason I bring that up is I'm not the,0.065134116
hugest fan of gangster films but the pedigree behind this movie and what this movie,0.16177133
was trying to pull off technologically speaking and that sort of thing I absolutely had,0.018880572
to see it so let's get into what I thought of it and I'll start,0.041599255
with the visual and when I speak of in SeaWorld's of course I'm talking about,0.013543139
the look of this film in terms of the irid us it look authentic to,0.036457386
that time period I think it's like the probably forties fifties sixties that sort of,0.050665706
thing this time period we're dealing with and I said of course it does you,0.03376073
know this is Martin Scorsese he doesn't leave anything to chance with stuff like that,0.033418827
you know he's a stickler for those types of details so it film definitely has,0.0547506
that look to it and if you're a fan of his work I think you'd,0.047601208
be really happy with what he did here like his other films it's not just,0.041087728
about the costumes that the characters are wearing or details like that oh he has,0.01642937
thousands of but it's the entire neighborhood and in locations that this stuff is shot,0.08365416
in and that it's authentic to the time period it's in and I think they,0.021156166
did a really good job with that because you definitely get sucked into that immediately,0.4993256
as soon as flashbacks weekend you know I was actually as I started watching you,0.0371984
guys instantly like what period is this you know so it does look authentic to,0.08223599
that period and then of course there's the technology behind this movie done by um,0.0354942
ILM and it's DD aging of these actors you know I think it's really just,0.05653396
done on these three actors Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and for the,0.073389046
most I would say it's well done I mean what they managed to pull off,0.08330693
here we've been seeing this sort of thing before of course we've seen it before,0.036527894
with Marvel and everybody but we've never seen this type of movie use this type,0.054648828
of technology usually they use practical effects you know but this this is something where,0.027053684
they needed to take 30 years off discard there's maybe 40 years of the the,0.01836306
ages of the actors and I think especially with um I would say with Joe,0.03151374
Pesci I think they did a really good job Alice well now when I get,0.060207102
to Robert De Niro for me um there were more months where I would get,0.02066659
that feelings like if you play video games you know what I'm talking about as,0.027682947
good as this stuff can look and it really looks amazing here to get like,0.017724484
wrinkles and laugh lines and all of that stuff in there the eyes there's something,0.041188173
about the eyes that can be kind of dead and I seen a lot with,0.17214021
a robot's character Frank the Irishman Sharon I see it they I don't know if,0.028132612
it's because of the blue eyes that it stands out a bit more on him,0.1038671
than it does on Joe Pesci and that sort of thing but it did pull,0.03535185
me out time to time when that would happen when I would get like a,0.056242608
full on a long shot of his face and I just be focusing on those,0.538782
eyes and it would just be like something is off it just seems like there's,0.02206148
nothing behind those eyes you know but it didn't happen often and the performances themselves,0.053646397
are so good that I could let that go and I'll get into the performances,0.047099657
now the acting which of course I think I feel like everybody of brings their,0.023426438
a-game to this you know because they're working with Scorsese they're gonna want to bring,0.04795841
their best and these are actors who for the most have not really been doing,0.070930526
amazing work there these are men with Stella Stella filmography of course but in recent,0.04628747
years it's been so so it's been a little crazy I mean opportunist showed up,0.1929598
in jackandjill of all things but here I thought that you could see that passion,0.14885479
for what they were doing come back and that especially goes for me without Pacino,0.07763358
his performance was the performance that kind of woke me up because there was a,0.027484722
point where um which I mean Joe Pesci Robert De Niro of course these guys,0.041599255
are fantastic together but I was just kind of watching the movie like okay yeah,0.07514513
this is good I'm enjoying this this is fine this is alright and then Al,0.019155959
Pacino comes on as Jimmy Hoffa and I sit up there's like a renewed energy,0.03842433
when he's on screen and my interest is piqued and I'm just sucked into anything,0.2388098
any conversations that include him so I just feel like he was a little bit,0.08001161
above he went above and beyond and he maybe maybe he was more invested a,0.013128065
little more passionate about what he would if I had to give the award for,0.02562487
the best actor for this movie in particular I would get it in my opinion,0.07383472
he's amazing yes Jimmy Hoffa but that does not speak ill of Joe Pesci or,0.036722794
Robert De Niro and Joe please against type in this search is so kind of,0.047280587
insane to see you know he he's the one who usually goes you know batshit,0.4263614
crazy and it was kind of nice to see a version of him playing a,0.12545563
version of a character who's a lot more stoic a character who you know he,0.024446163
doesn't let his emotions just fly off the handle so to speak I don't mad,0.033426143
about this character actually I like that a lot I always feel like you know,0.03204123
it's - should I say predictable to have like a mob boss who's always like,0.03707135
having a temper tantrum and beating somebody to death and all that sort of thing,0.58585584
I always find you know any movies or television series that covered these types of,0.032254755
characters mob bosses or drug traffickers whatever you know that kind of thing is to,0.07333516
see unintelligence to those characters that makes sense to me because if you live in,0.062559195
kind of life I mean you have to be pretty smart to stay alive so,0.24403325
I I enjoyed that aspect of what you was doing as well story-wise this movie,0.038096398
I mean it's based on a book I think the name of the book is,0.013579724
so I hear you paint houses or so I heard you paint houses and that,0.009786182
- basically means so I know you're a hip man that's other things just kind,0.1303527
of pretty cool I'm pretty messed up I've never read the book but the story,0.028935488
here is riveting enough that I mean most of us you know you may have,0.023514241
heard the name Jimmy Hoffa you know he disappeared but that was about the extent,0.0180757
of my knowledge and when you hear jokes about he's sleeping with the fishes and,0.080449305
that sort of thing but to really get into this and see that character and,0.027476741
his family and his friends are not sort of thing it was it was entertaining,0.0686556
I was intriguing to watch and that's another element of this movie that I'd quite,0.036299735
like because as massive as a spoon is in terms of scale and budget this,0.06941125
feels like it's the story of three men like it almost feels like this could,0.044979718
be an independent film that focuses on three personalities three characters and their friendships and,0.010029639
how you try to sustain loyalty and friendship in a will like that we are,0.017701868
eliminating somebody's you know taking somebody's life is just considered a business transaction I just,0.23538604
found that was the most compelling aspect of this movie for me was that friendship,0.036819246
and and how that affected them and their families are not life that they were,0.05012691
living in other than that this movie for me is a bit of a slog,0.08091892
it's really long I did feel that time crunch you know I wouldn't say I,0.049079243
was bored but I definitely was like whoo this is still happening this is still,0.019736
going that sort of thing I did have moments where I felt I got watching,0.022688748
this movie another aspect of this film for me that was a negative was the,0.05291802
young this is old know by that I mean these actors are they're not being,0.078054644
replaced by younger actors like what used to be done in past films you know,0.04036933
I do it they were hire young the person to portray Robert De Niro or,0.03500396
Ikki Fred Frank the Irishman that sort of thing these are these actors at their,0.07950874
age which I guess is their 70s or what however will they are right now,0.010793935
playing 40 year versions of themselves and the problem with that is whenever they have,0.020753065
to be physical or anything like that it gets a little wonky I'll give you,0.2536988
guys an example and I'll try not to be too spoilery there's a scene where,0.064973146
Frank has is beating up a guy for doing something you know he's offended him,0.27229413
and it's so awkward guys um it doesn't look big everything about that scene looks,0.109676145
really awkward it looks weird it looks like the guy's just lying on the floor,0.1278177
and he kicks don't even really look like they're landing properly I don't know if,0.2036433
it's technology like trying to make him look young in the moment why he's doing,0.03554675
that it just looks like an old dude with a young face beating up someone,0.67107695
so the movements are still fun I want key and it doesn't look natural at,0.03352592
all and I see that too sometimes with how they stand or how they sit,0.047354423
and get up you can see this edge behind not so to speak you know,0.06351706
that they're trying to move like younger men but you know it's not that easy,0.029641248
to do so it's weird it's weird to see somebody you know with this young,0.062137466
face but the energy of an older person it doesn't quite work and it does,0.03312016
make for some awkward moments here and there that just feels stiff but overall guys,0.10357109
this is this is a good movie you know I would not speak ill of,0.07100503
this movie I would definitely say watch it and it's available on Netflix now so,0.02215261
if you have a Netflix account you can definitely check this out if you haven't,0.020585438
seen it in cinemas that's how I watched it this weekend and I'm gonna give,0.026449697
the Irishman a seven and a half out of ten I know a lot of,0.040139176
people are there singing praises to this movie rightfully so for me like I said,0.132766
answer phones not my forte it's not something I really get into but as a,0.035564043
character piece I absolutely enjoyed those aspects of this movie I enjoyed the characters I,0.023381205
enjoyed seeing how their world works so to speak and if realism behind this film,0.07701164
as well you know I have to give it points for that so for me,0.03226673
personally it's a seven and a half out the time but it's a definite win,0.026032627
and it's a definite must-see of a film and that's gonna be it for this,0.028280282
