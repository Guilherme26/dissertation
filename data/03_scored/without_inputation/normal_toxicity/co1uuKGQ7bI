there's something to be said about a simple concept being done,0.054729473
right,0.04255815
in a film I love a complex mind-bending story as much as anyone but sometimes especially in thrillers and horror a simple idea can be very effective as long as the execution can maintain the tension,0.14933543
hey everyone i'm mariana and let's talk about a quiet place a mainstream horror film that has been making audiences very aware of how loud their popcorn is the premise is simple don't make noise or the aliens will kill you,0.4485866
we follow a family who have adapted to this post-apocalyptic setting and are doing their best to survive but still face daily challenges because let's be honest humans are not the quietest creatures naturally,0.1255416
one of the things that makes this movie work so well is the importance of silence,0.15015186
and that is the biggest contributing factor to the tension there are,0.05015894
so many mundane things that make noise that we don't even pay attention to,0.10198582
but in a quiet place they all suddenly become a source of danger,0.15346964
I loved the attention to details this film had showing how this family adjusted the simplest activities like eating or playing,0.08398828
board games while still trying to maintain a semi normal family life and attempting to give the children,0.15283924
some semblance of a childhood,0.21707885
I also do have to point out that the chemistry and the family dynamic were very believable probably mostly because John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are actually married in real life but the child actors fit in really well too,0.064778104
what also added to the realism of the situation is that balance of smart decisions and ones that were not so great as much as people love to criticize characters from the comfort of their own,0.111517474
it's for making poor choices,0.16524246
the reality is that nobody makes the right choices 100% of the time especially when it comes to stressful situations and working with limited information,0.044995558
that's just not how life goes and a quiet place has a reasonable grasp on that now being a film that is set around silence and tension,0.14798246
this is also a setup that just begs for jump-scares something that I am NOT a fan of I will say that they probably were as restrained as they could have been with this and someone else could have made this completely jump-scare central but there is a fair share of jump-scares in a quiet place and a few of them are false scares of witches a bit annoying,0.2392355
the other issue to point out here is that there is plenty of room for nitpicking there are some logic and logistics holes in the film from small things that are pretty easy to ignore to things like I can't believe nobody has tried this before certain things are done to set events in motion or for dramatic effects,0.064186744
so if you're going in with a mindset to pick this apart,0.111223556
you probably won't enjoy the movie as much as most people personally,0.09632898
I was able to look past a lot of this stuff,0.06990101
because the way the story is told and the overall experience ultimately took over the flaws,0.053994887
for me,0.058303766
however I can see how someone could be frustrated by certain parts of this movie still I would absolutely recommend you go see a quiet place even if you're not usually a horror fan this is not particularly gory or gross,0.2649173
it's mostly about the tension,0.053102918
and I am giving this film a solid 4 out of 5 stars,0.064776525
the one thing I would suggest though is seeing it during non-peak hours of the theater because I can easily see how a full theater was just a handful of or rude people can completely ruin the experience,0.17509602
