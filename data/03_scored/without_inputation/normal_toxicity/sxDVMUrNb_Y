arrival is directed by denis villeneuve the director of prisoners Sicario and enemy his films over the past few years have all been on my top 10 lists,0.18251124
so I was obviously very excited for arrival and this film stars Amy Adams Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker and is the story of aliens that have come down to earth they've landed in ships,0.15945773
no one knows what they want,0.0918014
so they send Amy Adams a renowned linguist to try to communicate with these aliens are they hostile are they peaceful,0.31089434
what did they want why are they here,0.054718185
and this movie was getting an absurd amount of buzz all positive,0.19637682
it had like a 100% for a really long time,0.053059172
I actually saw this movie on Monday at a screening and I waited this long to review it because I really needed to process it more I felt it was going to be a mistake if I just jumped in front of the camera and gave you my immediate thoughts because the film really messes with your mind a lot,0.18341002
and when you get to the third act it makes you rethink the rest of the movie,0.07188196
and I really needed to process this film think about it before I jumped in front of the camera,0.15119515
so that's why I waited this long to review it first off,0.0946785
this is a gorgeously directed movie if you've seen any of Danny's films you expected that the cinematography here is some of the best of the year particularly the shot in which we first truly see the alien aircraft,0.0693283
it's this incredible long take encompassing the entire area this thing has landed,0.11123532
in there's fog surrounding it it's jaw-dropping,0.085735016
and he does such a good job of setting up tension,0.07660137
in the first act with this character,0.077366956
you learn of her very tortured past and as these things start to land around the world you see news reports and it's very reminiscent of signs another very good alien,0.31215087
invasion film that you guys probably know I really like there's that sense of panic and paranoia you're wondering exactly what's happening here are they hostile,0.19899958
are,0.030010572
they peaceful is this gonna be War of the Worlds or Close Encounters of the Third Kind,0.31089434
and that first act does set up a lot of tension,0.06578188
it also sets up a great character,0.04491942
and Amy Adams because this is one of the best performances I've seen from her the entire film really rests on her shoulders and her bizarre unconventional character progression,0.1499192
it's a very different way of telling a story once you understand the way certain things are going in the background and if you're paying attention from seeing one it's gonna make sense to you,0.052878845
no,0.06626663
I don't want to get into spoilers in this review,0.14424811
I think that people should go into this movie as blind as possible the reason I wanted to think about it more though is because I wanted to tell if certain things really added up in my mind,0.14320062
and if things made as much sense as I thought they did while I was watching the movie because at first when I left this movie there was part of me that felt a little disappointed when a movie is still at 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes when it has like 70 something reviews you go in with mammoth expectations if I were you I would temper those expectations just ever so slightly because you don't want to go into a film thinking you're going to get the experience of some heavenly or of amazement,0.12582001
when it might just be really good when it comes to this movie what I like the most about,0.10106164
it are the visuals,0.06129274
the direction the cinematography Amy Adams performance and her interaction with these beings because the film's story in regards to communicating with aliens and using a language to solve problems and not cause problems is a really good message,0.072118595
and it's also a story of International Cooperation and how for once everyone just has to kind of settle their differences and work towards one goal,0.04916082
and I'm sure you knew this,0.0729097
and I'm sure a lot of other critics have said this,0.086276926
but this is no Independence Day,0.07975604
this is not a big action film this is more of a suspense drama centered around characterization using a more otherworldly circumstance to build that characterization kind of like signs did you're not gonna see laser guns and big explosions in this movie this is more centered on character is this movie the best alien,0.1510547
invasion movie ever made I would say it's definitely up there,0.1512258
it's one of the best top five for sure is it the best movie of Danny's career,0.05346957
I would disagree with that I would say that prisoners and Sicario are both better than this film I think those films are more,0.10548776
well paced this film is very slow paced,0.15432693
deliberately,0.057558745
it moves along at a snail's pace and for some viewers that's gonna be a humongous turn-off for me personally every frame in this movie is dripping with visual beauty,0.22115114
so if you appreciate things like that it's gonna move faster for you,0.08106648
and for me it did because it's just a gorgeous looking movie one of my biggest gripes with arrival,0.15623496
is the character by jeremy renner,0.05247161
I find him rather useless,0.51535875
there's even a scene where he says he has no idea where they'd be without Amy Adams character,0.15541597
he has one scene where he figures something out on his own without her help,0.19670485
but for the most part he's kind of in the background like hey yeah,0.118835025
I'm here I'm in the Avengers I'm Hawkeye I'm I'm here I'm relevant to this movie he just doesn't really add much to the film as a character he's fine with his performance but his character is rather bland and doesn't really have much to do in the film also the entire marketing push of this movie is why are they here,0.07398013
it's on almost every poster,0.06200286
once you learn why they are here,0.09204191
it's sort of glossed over very quickly,0.10137261
it's just kind of thrown at you,0.44510436
and you're meant to process it very fast,0.0814708
and then suddenly ignore it,0.12785752
so that aspect of the movie disappointed me it was more about Amy Adams character and less about why these things are here,0.077852815
and I appreciate the overarching symbolism of what's going on trust me,0.0749373
I've thought about this movie a lot and I don't want to spoil it for anyone,0.109514415
that's why I'm not getting too into it,0.06983969
but in the end aspects of the third act,0.052261222
and the way things came to a story conclusion did feel a little rushed,0.11039899
also there are some characters in the movie who watched too much TV and make a poor decision I don't want to spoil anything for you but that felt so out of left field and the overall impact of what they did didn't last more than a few minutes and really didn't change anything in the movie it just felt like a device to hopefully gain a little more suspense out of a few scenes and it didn't really build to anything,0.072179
so I wonder if it was even really necessary all in all arrival is a beautifully shot movie with great performances Forest Whitaker also really good in the film is accents a little iffy amazing visuals intriguing aliens a third act that has a very very cool revelation that really made me,0.08659988
think differently about the entire film I love that about this film,0.09008834
but the aspect of why the aliens are actually here on earth wasn't really explored as well as I would have liked it to be in the end,0.15138508
I would highly recommend seeing arrival,0.115967266
it's sort of a mash-up of contact signs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and I like all three of those movies seeing them all smashed into one was definitely a fun time for me,0.43529043
I'm gonna give arrival and a -,0.14821965
