Edmund Burke once said that the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing that's this movie spotlight released in 2015 is actually a Best Picture winner of that year and also won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay the film is directed by Tom McCarthy who is a writer of the Pixar movie up and also directed several TV shows from the show's 13 reasons why and Game of Thrones this movie has an all-star cast of Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo Rachel McAdams Liev Schreiber Brian D'Arcy James John Slattery and also Stanley Tucci spotlight is division of the Boston Globe newspaper who do months and months of in-depth investigative reporting on a certain subject in 2001 spotlight picked up an investigation of Roman Catholic priests abusing young children and that is going to be the shortest plot summary I'm ever going to give because this movie is so much more impactful when you go in not knowing any of the spoilers not knowing any of the cover-ups that this movie is spotlighting ha ha spotlight let's see what I did there yeah now this movie was not made for its entertainment value don't go into this movie thinking that you're gonna be entertained for two hours and believe me when I say this that is absolutely a compliment this movie is presented as a slice of life to the audience there's no criminals there's no courtroom drama it's not a thriller honestly I don't know how to categorize this movie it felt so real honestly it felt like you were watching a documentary of the actual events unfolding all thanks to the amazing amazing acting in this film this cast is one of the best on-screen ensembles I have ever seen everyone escapes so effortlessly and so seamlessly into their characters that again it feels like you're actually watching the real people doing this everyone in this movie is so subtle and so reserved they act like real reporters would if they were ever given situations and stories to do investigations on like there were no stereotypes there are no cliches of how we think reporters and editors are again it just felt so real it is great to see Michael Keaton finally getting good roles nowadays there was a long period there where he was not working that's an absolute shame because he is a tremendous actor Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as the heart of this movie and Rachel McAdams character shares a scene with her grandmother in this movie that is so powerful it's only 15 seconds long and there's no dialogue but it is so emotionally powerful it got me going in my opinion it is the most powerful scene of the movie and it's why I'm gonna give this movie the rating that I'm gonna be giving it and Liev Schreiber was great as the editor of the Boston Globe but he could have portrayed the editor very cliche like JJ from spider-man or Perry White from Superman who's always angry and always looking for that next story but Schreiber plays the editor so introverted and so soft-spoken hmm have I mentioned how amazing the acting was the cinematography is also brilliant in this movie because again it doesn't feel like you're actually watching a movie it actually feels like you're watching real life but they also do a great job of showing how influential the Roman Catholic Church is to the city of Boston there were several exterior shots in this movie where our characters would be walking down a street they would be at someone's house or they would walk by a playground with children playing on it and there would be a church right there in the background it's always there it's on every street corner and once I noticed that my stomach dropped six feet under it was very very powerful imagery guys I think this is gonna be a very short review because I don't want to give away any spoilers I don't want to give away any of the discoveries that we the audience make when we go into the film not knowing anything but I will tell you to stick around for the credits because they show you something that is such a gut punch for an event like this it's it's very effective all I will say is that this film does show how good and how powerful and how positive investigating reporting can be and this movie also shows you that you have a voice and you have a responsibility to stand up and speak up against those oppressors who do wrong in this world and if you don't do that how much better are you than those who actually do those heinous acts okay I'm done I'll get off my soapbox now so everyone this is a first for my channel I'm gonna give spotlight five out of five blu-rays please please please check out spotlight it is a fantastic film I think it was a little overshadowed at the Oscars because when they won their Best Picture was after Leo finally won his Best Actor Academy Award and I think the main reason why everyone was watching that year was to watch Leo win that award and didn't really care about anything else so please again see this movie all right guys now comes my
