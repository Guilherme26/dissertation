what our peeps Tony Baker here back for another movie review this time I'm reviewing the black plans me old cake cake cake classic black clansmen I don't even know how to say it I've never said it out loud black pit cake click clansmen black cuckoo-land sound like I'm still doing but you know what I mean black cake a clamp I don't know it's a new spike Lee joint man and the best spike Lee joint I've seen in a long time probably the best spike Lee joint since the inside man but the inside man didn't really feel like a spike Lee joint but it was inspired to be joint but it didn't it didn't fall into the spike Lee joint mold this is right up Spike Lee's alley right here the subject matter the tone this is right up his alley it was good to see him back back in form and you don't there and shout out his documentary he's done some great documentaries but like a movie with the with the attention of the people in his style of director it's good to see him back man anyway the story's about it's based on a true story which I didn't know about until the movie came out about a black cop who infiltrated the KKK I was like what a Colorado Springs police officer infiltrated the KKK via telephone conversations then he had another cop go in that poses him infiltrated the KKK I was like wow I thought they made it up for for a film you know I thought it was just a Chappelle's Show sketch and then they expanded it on that but no life is stranger than fiction man I was like wow that's pretty dope the movie stars John David Washington and you got Alec Baldwin in there you got Topher Gracie you have Adam driver and the girl from spider-man homecoming because I was trying to figure out the whole time because she had an afro I was like this girl looks so familiar I was looking at the whole town I can't wait to get on IMDB when this movie is over that's what I love about IMDB you can just go straight to there's no back in the day I grew up in the 80s there was no IMDB you had to really be like I know that face from somewhere but you don't even know the name so even even when the cast rolls at the end you don't even know who you're looking for we love crap I see the name but there's nothing what else were they in but now I am DB highlight Paul Walter Hauser who played in the he played an eye tiniest shine Eckhart he played in that movie man he killed me in Italian he killed me again in this man the way he plays his characters is hilarious and this movie man there's a lot of funny stuff in this movie it's not like a it's not like a you know serious are we gonna be serious and stressed and pissed off the whole movie it's like a lot of moments of comedy in this movie and a lot of hard-hitting moments too and like you know you really just take it in and it's just cool the see and like these characters the characters they create it they felt really like lived in and creeping like you find yourself like even the KKK members you find yourself like this guy right here is not that bad even though he's in the KKK I could deal with him right here this guy's just no but this guy kind of cool laid-back kind of like his attitude even though he hates people like me did bad if a guy that's when you know you've created like good characters like when you could still find a nugget of humanity in there and like you know there was a wife of one of the KKK members who did a good job - she was like this happy homemaker type but she was really just racist as hell but it was just good to see but had the sweetest face I'm the old guy all this ugliness coming out of this didn't see that coming but you see it coming because she's married to a die-hard Klansmen seen women to die hard out here man when they believe in something off man it worse in the men those dynamics were really good in this picture like there was a moment in the movie where they were like dancing and like a at a party and you know this is seventies so the music was right they had the afro was gone I found myself smiling at the scene like I want to be there yeah I told my girlfriend I was like I wanted to be at that party you know this she just looked at me like what don't judge me out here the performance would be good man it was just a good flow occasionally I would like drift off and kind of be like where are they going right now like they were there with definitely moments do the editing and like you know those type of choices where I was just like where we're going now okay all right that's cool that's cool why we why do we go there this way spike all right so I definitely had moments of that this movie is not flawless but it was a good watch and the last the final ending moments in the movie were very powerful I'm not gonna say what happened I'm not gonna tell you just gonna have to see it for yourself what did it was just silent it was very powerful man my girl was like I almost folded that was like this this movie is right on time this is the one-year anniversary you know the stuff that went on in Virginia with the tiki torches neither I say anymore and so it's very timely this is very on the button issues so it really resonates and that's one of the takeaways man the timeliness of it another takeaway is man Denzel Sun he has the future man like you know he plays on the HBO series ballers and like this is the first time I seen him in the film I probably seen him in other films didn't even know it was him and he has a future man is just like his pops he did a good job I was listening to see if he sounded like Denzel if he moved like I thought I heard pockets was like yo he sounded like busy right there but I don't know if I'm overlooking like says I know who his dad is I'm like oh that was it is it I think I heard a little bit in it but if I didn't know who he was what I had heard then zero probably not probably not he's his old man I'm saying but I was definitely looking and listening definitely doing that this is easily the best Spike Lee movie in a long time does it live up to the hype it's a good movie it's a good movie is the great table's great I say it's good though very timely but you know it didn't it didn't blow my socks off it didn't make my team shatter but it is definitely definitely better than chiraq chiraq that spike Lee joint right there pissed me off it's not just because I'm from Chicago but it might be because up from Chicago I just didn't like how it was done I was like this is I really didn't like chiraq at all so this is a big it's a big improvement it was Spike Lee's last movie but forget all that man y'all want to know the smooth jazz review of black clansmen well here it is oh yeah I'm giving black clansmen three and a half saxophone side of the five I'm gonna be called a de clan and see if they can uh tell it I'm black alright peeps that's my review of black Klansmen let me know what you thought about the movie in the comment section below are you excited about it have you seen it what do you think about I would bring up other movies in the same vein but I honestly couldn't think of anything based on the true story so it's not a lot of movies to compare it to I was gonna say American History X with non-us that's different and like you know get out but no that's that's different as well so this is just its own movie night but let me know what you thought in the comments section below don't forget to Like share and subscribe and as usual we out here
