a quiet place is a new film directed by and starring John Krasinski,0.09855637
the general idea of the film is that creatures have appeared on the earth that attack sound,0.1279624
so the movie tells the story of a specific family trying to survive this apocalypse,0.08686381
that's happening while having to remain absolutely quiet all the time that's the setup for the movie it makes for a very enjoyable very tense thriller,0.1111912
now if you've seen the movie go ahead and tell me down below in the comment section,0.13493395
what did you think about the movie did you love,0.10066252
it did you hate,0.35717934
it was a perfect all that fun stuff,0.08288836
let's have a nice lively discussion as for me,0.08859465
this was one of my most anticipated movies going into 2018,0.08124044
it was in my top 10 video that I made and I was very very happy with the movie that John Krasinski delivered,0.08364504
with that said let's talk about the good,0.0519248
and the best thing about this movie is that it just manages to build this sense of tension throughout the entire movie right from the very beginning of the film it just screeched this atmosphere where you know anything could happen that creates a sound and it could go horribly wrong and right from the get-go,0.074402325
it establishes the stakes the world around us and the rules for how we need to function it establishes right out of the gate,0.102702215
this means the whole rest of the movie we have this sense of tension and deep emotion from beginning to end,0.06656434
and the reason this works is the premise is very simple and straightforward there's creatures that attacks sound so if humans make noise they will die very simple setup,0.2699251
and it's the story that only is talking about one family,0.037795935
it's not trying to explore the ramifications in the world,0.08226921
it's not trying to tell a story about civilizations and decline,0.0858818
it's a simple story about a family trying to survive in this very simple premise,0.07689703
and what that means is that we notice all the details throughout the story because we're not being distress did buy all,0.053365543
the dialogue sorts of things,0.08367585
well you notice all the details throughout the film in order to show you a small detail a toy something at the house something making that could potentially make some noise and instantly you feel all the tension because you see everything that can go wrong with that in with that and with that doubt the whole movie and as it goes through things Kaczynski will just linger for just a second too long on something and by too long I mean so you're you know you're supposed to notice it too long in the right sense,0.08954913
and so you see it and you can just get this lingering sense of Doom surrounding the smallest details about this house about the family about the little choices that they make,0.05134023
and it just builds this incredible sense of tension and the way it's crafted as a movie is that it starts out kind of slow as we're building the world,0.09199964
what does their life,0.0989159
look like what's the dynamics of the family,0.07393355
what have they gone through what are the hurts and pains of being in this scenario and then it gets going and once it gets going it just does not let up for the entire life,0.09291026
second half of the movie it just is so tense and you can just see all the things that could potentially go wrong with the scenario they're going in it's a movie this is so wonderfully crafted to take full advantage of every scenario that would happen with the world that they built that the scenario that these characters are,0.054541744
and and the acting thread is just great the use of sound is wonderful the use of music is great,0.07627769
and the thing that I knew going into it that it was going to have some great thrills to it because I'd heard that from everyone,0.058874685
they didn't seen it,0.052932054
what I didn't realize going into,0.057828415
it is the level of emotional depth that it would be able to pull out of this situation,0.06046434
it find the little details the the right dynamics,0.067852154
they're just the whole movie there's this deep sense of emotion throughout the whole thing,0.058712304
and that's what made this movie,0.07385377
so satisfying as you went through this journey and that has so little dialogue but you feel so much without it needing to be set,0.11620803
that's what that's great filmmaking,0.08231749
and that's a great example of what you can do with cinema where it's a visual storytelling format,0.030812623
and this is a movie that uses the visuals so wonderfully and it's almost a perfect movie but not quite there's some problems with the movie so move on to the bag is very few issues here,0.063911304
and I can't go too many details into it because it the two problems with it would be some of the stuff where they go to the resolution where they try to tie everything up and give you a satisfactory conclusion comes off a little bit contrived a little bit like,0.11591735
it's a movie that knows it needs to kind of come to a satisfying conclusion,0.1185566
and so the logic has to cheat a little bit with what they show you with the amount of kind of backstory the amount of time that's passed in this world,0.17362371
it feels a little bit like it doesn't think she did a little bit,0.22224066
That's not me,0.09459165
that's what I can't don't want to say too much about it that's all I'll say cut about that one,0.08377604
and then the second problem time somewhat directly to that in the last ten minutes once again because they wanted to have that nice satisfactory conclusion,0.083641656
it feels a little bit out of step with some of what happens in the final ten minutes what I wanted to say too much,0.10560987
if you've seen the movie you probably know what I'm talking about feels a little bit out of step but these are very minor criticisms of the movie ah here's what I'll say this is a movie that is within inches of fully accomplishing its ambitions,0.09313169
it's a movie that was trying to be one thing,0.101690285
and it's this close to being a perfect version of that they just had to cheat just a little bit to get it get it there I'm gonna give this one an A and an honor to tamp entertainment level,0.14869179
I would give this one a 9 out of 10,0.19809312
it delivered absolutely the experience,0.041680057
I wanted I had a blast with this movie it's it's not a movie that's trying to be the greatest of all time,0.17919445
but for the movie it's trying to be it does an excellent job of executing on the premise on almost every single level,0.122490905
