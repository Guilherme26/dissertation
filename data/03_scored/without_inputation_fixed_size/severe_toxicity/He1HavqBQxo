[Applause] [Applause] everyone today I've got your Dunkirk movie review based on the heroic true,0.02863017
story from the frontlines at Dunkirk soldiers fight for survival is this the war film,0.042732064
that we've been waiting for so as far as the story goes Christopher Nolan directs,0.03567646
this action packed so I'm not bringing back to a time when opposing forces were,0.029594686
fighting or evacuating to a beach for safety I am a huge fan of Christopher,0.05114996
Nolan has been a fan of many of his films and I personally think that,0.06631083
a war genre film I think is definitely fitting for a director like him I,0.1182936
think he did a good job with how he was setting up this film and,0.03141197
wanting to tell this story because it is a very important story one that maybe,0.031419285
I wasn't too familiar with in the beginning until I saw this film and I,0.027228627
got to learn more of what exactly went on in this one period of time,0.035069812
I think he does deliver of film that you can really learn the history of,0.043799683
you know what happened at Dunkirk some things might be a little confusing at times,0.016682805
right away you see these soldiers who are in abundance they're trying to get off,0.049030688
this beach they're all sort of collectively forming these lines and some of them a,0.043861546
majority of them were alive and on some of them you see weren't I was,0.08349917
almost horrific to see but that was the reality of war where they were going,0.041295268
to be casualties it's also even scarier when you had to see them doctor times,0.06593234
every time a point would show up you knew that something was about to go,0.019851075
down and even when they were on their ships or at least trying to get,0.03842101
to them or trying to get off of them sometimes I felt like this movie,0.044495463
was hard to follow because throughout the film you know they have all these different,0.017419165
types of characters the story goes back and forth following these different characters with their,0.004615044
own points of view women will be data and then the next it'll be nighttime,0.21436541
so it kind of gets confusing when all of that happens as far as the,0.026334621
casting goes you've got a pretty good cast in this movie definitely a lot of,0.05715391
a listers that I'm glad to see in Christopher Nolan film some who have previously,0.06293369
worked with him and some whom are newcomers and even somewhat to acting but you've,0.020598741
got Mark Rylance he's on this boat and he takes his son and this other,0.033545878
boy along for the ride to go help pick up these soldiers who could be,0.035880007
stranded on the wharf once and I really liked seeing him in this movie even,0.13048309
though sometimes he felt very defeated against some of these other characters you've got Killian,0.14711268
Murphy who is someone who you you kind of don't want to trust but then,0.06913387
you also feel sorry for him all at the same time and he comes to,0.038742956
contact with Mark Rylance his character so I like to see him here as well,0.034837663
you've got Harry Styles who if you are a One Direction fan it was really,0.04301676
cool to see him preparing himself for this role he had to cut off all,0.36214063
of his hair and he had to go full commitment as a soldier and although,0.017942663
I feel like he doesn't have as much screen time I think it was just,0.032711737
really cool to see him actually pull off his role so I think he did,0.07561941
at least a piece of performance Tom Hardy who plays a pilot who you see,0.02308653
a lot in the air he's a great actor and it's very believable and he's,0.05754903
very a you know believable in this role and he's also very intense at times,0.02629737
and I just loved seeing him here as well as Kenneth Branagh who I felt,0.07351277
like was going to have a much bigger role in this film but I wasn't,0.024126876
too disappointed when he didn't but I'm at least glad that I got to see,0.026965879
him portray the sort of captain character and he definitely pulls it off things that,0.018712947
I liked about this movie was right off the bat seeing that beautiful cinematography I,0.085388295
know Christopher Nolan is very good with his IMAX cameras this movie should definitely be,0.037672676
seen in IMAX however I didn't see it in I'm expand when the scenes that,0.014308101
were shot in IMAX came out I knew man like that just all looks so,0.19593915
cool and there were these intense scenes that you know sometimes put me on the,0.043242257
edge of my seat and I was literally just seeing the danger that these guys,0.039538518
were in and you really felt like you were there with these action scenes that,0.043552235
were put together well and you felt the realism when they're on the ships or,0.049584784
they're in the air it was almost heart-stopping to watch these moments unfold especially when,0.02122468
it gets intense when you're on the front lines with these soldiers and sometimes they,0.028789813
can be caught crossfire or ambushed and it just gets terrifying but unfortunately the things,0.11293022
that I didn't really like about this film was that while some parts of the,0.035111718
movie were fast paced I couldn't help but feel like there were a couple scenarios,0.028119309
that were constantly being played out over and over again and repetition and I felt,0.07173141
like I couldn't see any results coming from that which is why I feel like,0.012040489
they just kept on constantly doing the same things over and over again so we've,0.018874586
made the film feel a little bit slow and dragged out and I was really,0.05005906
surprised because I had no idea that this was an over to hour-long film and,0.0212453
that's what made it so fast paced doesn't made it go by so fast because,0.015746893
of all the other scenes but then without those seams this movie dragged on overall,0.051861707
I thought that this movie you know it wasn't disappointing to me but I was,0.04575
slightly disappointed the fact that it's not one of my favorite Christopher Nolan films out,0.056853246
there unlike his Batman self it was exactly what I expected it to be I,0.036895078
wouldn't say I was completely disappointed by it in the end so I would still,0.028936818
highly recommend seeing this movie to anyone whether you're a a war film buff or,0.113779
you're a history buff I think this is a movie to definitely check out even,0.11043379
if at times it does miss its mark so I would give this for hearts,0.033359624
