Katelyn Deaver stars in book-smart where she does her best to break out of her,0.3103417
character as smart and responsible Eve Baxter by playing somebody who is smart and responsible,0.10112384
except with a terrible mouth its Olivia Wilde's feature-length directorial debut so how does she,0.47215557
do with this high school drama tea so it's the day before graduation and the,0.08176072
two top students in the school who happen to be best friends realize that they,0.055486258
have missed out on all kinds of parties and really just high school social life,0.105791
because they focused so much on their schoolwork in order to get into the top,0.14165546
schools then they realize though that their friends well their acquaintances their classmates who did,0.08176188
party who did have a lot of high school experiences also got into those exact,0.06695163
same top schools so they set out on the night before graduation to find an,0.045097966
epic party so that they can kind of cram all of these experiences into one,0.109401174
night before they graduate all of the characters seem to be kind of caricatures of,0.08641975
real-life I mean they are all just taken kind of to the extreme and really,0.24004944
exaggerated I mean like the jock is all jock the skater is kind of just,0.2557257
dumb and brainless and a little bit clueless the the stoner is well there's stoned,0.84375924
out of their minds and even the gay guys are just wildly an overly flamboyant,0.74066293
and just it was a little off-putting to see all of these characters who are,0.084309936
just such extremes of anything based in reality I mean yes you do have all,0.14369191
of these people on all of those as examples in real life but typically you,0.15117843
don't have all of them to such a degree in one small little microcosm so,0.1518654
to see them all put into that situation it did feel just a little bit,0.15424022
forced like it didn't feel or ring true so along with Kaitlyn Dever we have,0.07238089
beanie Feldstein and together they're kind of good I mean they they for the most,0.09953363
part bring out the best in each other I mean they really work hard as,0.1526094
best friends to complement each other to lift each other up and I appreciated that,0.073844545
a lot but on the other hand they're also super crude together and that began,0.065110624
to really great on me just it it became wildly unnecessary and like that they,0.18570538
were just trying to be crude for Croods sake now I'm not a prude or,0.29737297
even disillusioned that there aren't crude people out there and that that's not how real,0.0960669
life is however in this scenario it felt forced it felt almost like that's how,0.06080816
it should be that everybody should be crude or that they should be acting like,0.08676775
this versus it kind of being in the minority I mean I volunteer with middle,0.09679934
schoolers and high schoolers and for the most part they don't act this way I,0.111289255
mean sure there are some that do and and we all have our periods of,0.044233777
you know acting out or whatever but this in this instance in the film it,0.087132595
just it felt like it was trying to tell us no no this is how,0.05973616
you're supposed to be versus hey that's kind of an anomaly or a little blip,0.31089434
on the screen the pace of the film is is pretty good I mean it,0.058362246
moves along and it keeps the story going for the most part right up until,0.043155022
about the beginning of the third act and then it just kind of steps on,0.071590476
the brakes for a minute and it slows way down and then after that it,0.072744414
picks back up again so you know I had a minor pacing issue there just,0.05211265
because you start to feel the time just a tiny bit but for the most,0.15106565
part throughout the film you don't notice the time moving along I like some of,0.06878313
the interactions between the characters and I also really like that some of the assumptions,0.07581182
that are placed on the characters at the beginning of the film or that we,0.032532826
are told to have assumptions as an audience they turn out to be wrong and,0.074775174
then also that we see growth in some of the characters I really like that,0.036211114
I really appreciate that fact because have the characters all stayed flat throughout the entire,0.063740335
thing then it's just kind of pointless I mean there's no reason to watch because,0.2668359
it's just you're just watching a day in the life of somebody where they don't,0.15490258
learn anything and to me that's just kind of a waste of time but they,0.4087302
thankfully didn't do that with all of the characters I mean you actually saw growth,0.08882101
you saw change you saw repentance or remorse or just you know them working on,0.136956
relationships and that was awesome there are some genuinely funny moments in the film and,0.034505274
some parts where I laughed out loud but I think they're kind of few and,0.14970328
far between that most of the time when there was humor sometimes it felt forced,0.049757168
or it just wasn't funny well you can probably get a little bit of enjoyment,0.20748848
from book-smart I don't think it's memorable and it's certainly not that funny and really,0.097049505
I don't think it's worth the time or the money certainly to rush right out,0.074320376
and just drop all of your cash on it in the theater check it out,0.106849834
on Netflix wait for it for red box absolutely because then you're not out a,0.1156608
ton of cash I mean there are some redeeming points in the movie but overall,0.07401931
it was just kind of there there's no violence but there is sex nudity and,0.562642
a ton of profanity I give book-smart two and a half out of five couches,0.24136804
what is a really good high school comedy or drama that I should check out,0.073002495
