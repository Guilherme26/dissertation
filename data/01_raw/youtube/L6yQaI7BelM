[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's going on guys I'm back in the building with another movie review if you're new to the channel don't forget to push that subscribe button and also don't forget to thumbs this video up let's get into this movie review of black Klansmen let's talk about this movie this movie takes place in the 70s where we find a young black detective named Ron stalwart who infiltrates and exposes the Ku Klux Klan ladies and gentlemen we had a Mission Impossible movie without Tom Cruise let's talk about this script I got mixed feelings about this script because there's things that I love and there's a lot of [ __ ] that I hate it I love the truth behind this script I loved how they were able to transition most of the truth over and present it to me I hate it they added BS to fill in Lord knows what then the reason why I hated it because it was obvious it's like not that Najee what no this movie [ __ ] I know the difference I watch a lot of film I know and I hate it the fact that they say they should have just kept it 100 if you say Oh movies based on a true story then [ __ ] worth word scene for scene needs to be true and they didn't do that they added bits of it which sort of just as I just said this movies based on true events these are actual characters in real life doesn't the guy live by Ron stall where this is what he is and this is what a David Duke looks like you know I mean these are the characters I would have enjoyed that perspective then giving me a true story because you can look at him like nah that's wack let's talk about the cast I'm only going to mention two characters Adam driver John David Washington hey lied dude 3 Topher Grace Topher Grace first let me give you the good in the bad the good Adam driver that [ __ ] connect he's I think he's a very underrated actor because of Star Wars and people were not really speaking on him but I've seen him in a couple of our roles and Adam driver knocks it out the park every time I really enjoy seeing him in this movie he played a undercover detective named Flip Zukerman and he was Jewish but you know how some people you grow up Jewish but you don't grow up Jewish that's your religion that's where you're from that's when you that's what you are but you don't push it is like being Christian Laudes people Christian but they don't push it and I really enjoyed seeing him cuz he played the opposite ron Stallworth he was the white guy who when it was time to face to come face to face with the Ku Klux Klan member that's what they that's what he sent and I think he did a hell of a good job and it really showed me his acting chops topher I think did a decent job but [ __ ] he's Eric Foreman and everything he does my gosh he's Eric Foreman and everything he does my [ __ ] he has not changed one bit every time I see him I think of read from that 70 show every tyronn ik for his movies in the 70s John David Washington this is the first time I seen him in anything and I'm have to say this he sucked in his movie I'm gonna give her another chance though it's the first time I seen him but he sucked in his movie his voice was annoying as [ __ ] he was corny as [ __ ] his costume design was wack as [ __ ] and his jokes were wack as [ __ ] overall he was wack as [ __ ] I didn't I couldn't understand it I was like why how what I'm like don't stop it aah whack aah he sucked in this movie and it hurt because he was the star of the movie I'm watching him over and over just sound corny his voice was so annoying and it was at a point that we accept and we were like is he doing this on purpose and then we we went and looked it up on you oh my god he sounds like that there's parts of this movie that really make this movie bad and let's just say his voice he sucked make him another chance though my semen something knows this was not a movie for him I could nah nah nah he sucked in his movie man if Adam driver wasn't in this film I would I had a horrible time he sucked his everything up it just was bad he was bad let's get on other parts the directing Spike Lee does a spike Lee joint yo Spike Lee on a directors perspective did good but because it's Spike Lee I'm not gonna give you that good credit you did bad because you know there's certain elements of this movie that Spike Lee just refused to capture and regardless of the movie Colin called Black Klansmen showing the Ku Klux Klan and then show the Black Panther black power on it all that good stuff he refused to make this movie feel black it didn't even feel white this movie had no culture to it it's showed us as a director when you see certain scenes where black people were being abused black people are are coming together in spirit hopes and hopeful spirit and they're joining forces for better cause and you see the racist cops trying to destroy that saying hateful things you're supposed to feel some type of way when you hear the word [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] uh what's to call it pick a nanny or something like that with the little pig oh [ __ ] you just wrecked me you know I mean you're supposed to you're supposed to rekt me when you hear the black people coming together my god they put Harry Belafonte in his movie y'all know him Harry Belafonte had all the [ __ ] bad more for the back and a Carmen Jones I know but anyway you're supposed to fill him when he sits on that charity talks Spike Lee did a poor job I didn't feel anything didn't didn't didn't get emotional didn't we didn't even have the pride you know when when when his movie based on some stories so obviously the the Ron Ron actually survived and one for the team but you didn't feel it and as a director Spike Lee did not deliver he sucked at that too I know this is gonna sound [ __ ] up but this is the truth keeping their sheep on honey would you be sighs Corey Hawkins y'all know him dr. Dre it's better come the black actors sucked in this movie they weren't believable the costume designs were corny the afros look like wigs the clothes the way they dance their vibe it did not mesh well but the white actors will [ __ ] out of all ones in this scene we were like man I [ __ ] selling races in a [ __ ] my gosh they did their part but don't black actors oh sucked they did not feel authentic and it hurt because I didn't build the black coming off of them I felt young actors trying to make away and it hurts this movie terribly the casting sucked and the directing sucked because all this [ __ ] was supposed to happen you gotta remember you can see it visually but I don't mean you feel it yeah I mean we watch a lot of movies out here you can see a [ __ ] get his head blown off boom clean off but a director and good acting make you feel it oh [ __ ] up you know I'm saying you can see a hospital scene somebody dying on a dead [ __ ] oh we're good acting and directing make your village uh-huh you don't die oh he coming back he's dead Lassie you can see it it's there directly to make you feel it ah you know I'm saying they drop the ball on that the or the the music Spike Lee literally tried to go back to like old-school Spike Lee with the music and he did not mesh well with these actors the music was poor ah I was tired of singing it was Ron start-stop Star Wars had a scene every time you hadn't seen it was a certain song for him like staff or something but it wasn't not don't take it like doodoo doodoo don't take it like that but it was more of a you know every time he had his scene it was that that that music that played with play them play with him I was annoyed you should remind me of school days and [ __ ] like it was like stop it was like do the right thing he was like stop I was like Michael Max is like stop brothers stop stop stop aah he killed me and then he did that one shot you know when Spike Lee and you they move forward but this up enough pro and cons the movie has great elements to it visually it doesn't hold up to certain points the white cast it holds up the black cast it doesn't directing Spike Lee did good but because of Spike Lee I'm not not freak that you did bad I was expecting more from Spike especially on a piece like this when you see Spike Lee and he did Malcolm X mmm one of the most powerful scenes at our whole movie Rickman brings tears my just thinking about [Applause] that's too much powerful one man he did the pick on he moved and that wake up was like man and not one not one minutes how I know I know not we gotta do something I felt it but anyway I hold you up for that kind of seat cuz that shit's mmm based on some story right did based on true story right when believable this one with um let's rate this thing black Klansmen has good elements but has a lot of bad elements but I really did appreciate the story I appreciate it mostly actors what hurts that the most is the costume design the directing and the star John Washington not being believable to me personally to me I'm gonna give black Klansmen a c-minus because that's good trace but it also has a lot of bad ones and it leaves you questioning the script like why would you write that I know you added the end but why why is this why is that really hurts the movie I hope you guys enjoyed the real thumbs this video up don't forget to subscribe to j-3 entertainment and also on your big shout out to my patreon family for holding your boy down and shot the team j-3 for keepin it keepin it 100 with me at all times j-3 out [Music]
