this movie I was hyped because based on a few minutes that we got to,0.06827578
see a black panther in civil war a couple years ago it made me excited,0.3009873
for a character I didn't know much about and for me Black Panther is sort,0.1050591
of like the Batman of the Marvel Universe he has the coolest costume and the,0.03250686
coolest gadgets and speaking of Black Panthers costume in this film there's a lot of,0.02024553
upgrades and changes made to his costume where he essentially gets power upgrades and now,0.021438204
he's more indestructible than he ever was before and from a visual standpoint I understand,0.07154183
why they made some of the changes and tweaks to his costume aesthetically and from,0.05277035
a storytelling perspective I can understand why the powered up his suit essentially now he's,0.043487046
stronger than he was in previous movies because in future Marvel films you're going to,0.04599479
have black panther standing side by side with Thor and Hulk and he has to,0.05045551
look like he can carry his own so that made sense to me now let's,0.0961809
talk about a little animated movie called The Lion King which came out in 1994,0.114647724
and this is a true story when I was a young kid when I watched,0.029749673
The Lion King I thought to myself if I try really hard in life one,0.20418212
day I'll grow up to become a lion because I I don't know why I,0.0895876
just wanted to fight hyenas I thought I could do that physically you have no,0.2782221
idea how letdown I was when I found that two years ago I couldn't and,0.047621828
this is nothing new or groundbreaking over the last couple of weeks many people have,0.022084096
compared the film black panther to The Lion King and I will just say this,0.045210537
if the writer a black panther was not heavily influenced by the story of The,0.012597913
Lion King well then it's the biggest quit Siddhant in film history that or he's,0.08974924
just lying because if someone told me to take the Lion King and turn it,0.08697143
into a comic book live-action movie it would turn out just like Black Panther let,0.12907955
me tell you something my father told me Simba everything the light touches is ours,0.07165026
you must never go there that's all I got now as far as the overall,0.09605718
look at the film black panther visually it's very impressive when you see the cityscapes,0.028119974
of Wakanda and African landscapes when I was watching the film I was genuinely interested,0.033009075
in this place Wakanda I wanted to learn more about it I wanted to see,0.045177277
the characters interacting in a social environment and how things look and how things interact,0.017113844
with each other and what makes this place so great and when you only get,0.03636825
three or four different locations that are all the essentially the same interior shots use,0.015890572
throughout the movie which is a lab where his sister develops the suits a little,0.048217833
place where they grow plants and then you have the throne room and outside of,0.053627107
that you really don't get much more and that's a little bit disappointing when you,0.0941175
see this huge amazing looking city you want to know more about it and I,0.035653178
thought the film could have established Wakanda as the character of its own throughout the,0.008861576
movie a little bit more so than it did now as far as chadwick boseman,0.069733866
who plays to chala aka Black Panther I understand that the character at times is,0.024502039
supposed to be stoic he is a leader he's very intelligent but I didn't really,0.05696433
feel like much charisma was coming from him as an actor throughout the film or,0.023229543
not enough to really make him stand out and get audiences rooting for him throughout,0.0667698
the movie I didn't really get that and with that said I think chadwick boseman,0.024633082
is a phenomenal actor the first movie I remember seeing him in was the movie,0.026668543
42 now real quick there's just one more thing I wanted to mention about Black,0.14406148
Panther in this film and that is if you watch the film Civil War when,0.016416067
you saw a Black Panther for the first time he was doing flips and kicking,0.38456354
ass and he seemed real competent and confident as the character Black Panther he knew,0.24450007
what he was doing it didn't feel like his first day on the job but,0.013996129
in the film black panther black panther himself doesn't seem like he's that great of,0.016023608
a fighter he kind of gets knocked down a lot and he almost needs to,0.103765324
be saved multiple times by his female bodyguards who also saved the day multiple times,0.08356103
now the character in this film that has the most depth and substance is the,0.012797468
character kill monger play by Michael B Jordan and I think they cast this character,0.5122359
perfectly because kill monger is he's a badass he has a motive that makes sense,0.44305196
and you understand it and even if you don't agree with it at least you,0.04487196
understand it the guy just wants to take what Condon's technology and give it to,0.031547
everyone else because he thinks they're being selfish and when you watch the film you,0.09424522
almost agree with them at times but as far as Michael B Jordan as a,0.022065472
villain in this film I thought that's what really held this movie together and gave,0.07281433
it the depth and the substance that it needed and as the old saying goes,0.014226283
a hero is only as good as his villain and I think they got the,0.097231224
villain right this time especially for a Marvel movie where the villains are typically just,0.054739293
big monster guys who want to do bad stuff for the sake of doing bad,0.45844075
stuff this time around you actually got a character and now I do have one,0.031554315
other negative with the film and that's some of the visuals and the fighting and,0.023484308
action sequences throughout the movie for example there's one fight scene that takes place on,0.043158446
a waterfall we see this group of people in the background cheering on and I,0.11391669
remember watching that scene in the theater and thinking those people in the background remind,0.06682435
me of the people in the background Street Fighter 2 yo and also throughout the,0.023640627
movie there's an overabundance of CG that makes the character of Black Panther when he's,0.06663544
fighting look like a video game cutscene at times Black Panther is directed by Ryan,0.15748422
Coogler who directed the film Creed you have this extended one take shot with no,0.14102691
cuts no edits and it's a phenomenal scene and I was hoping for something like,0.054603595
that in the film Black Panther because it seems like that that make movies stand,0.040586844
out in action sequences feel so real and you remember them for years to come,0.017717166
there isn't really one action sequence you're going to remember are you were on the,0.01300301
edge of your seat watching their all-sufficient they're entertaining at times to watch but I,0.05033977
really was expecting more now here are my final flicking thoughts on the film black,0.11701112
panther overall this is a fun comic book movie that is entertaining at times and,0.062438793
the best thing about this movie is it's a comic book movie that has a,0.05579893
moral message to tell people and it's you should help people just because you have,0.04163451
something doesn't mean you should keep it for yourself give it to people help them,0.020618033
out and that's a good message that's positive two thumbs up for that but I,0.034543652
would be lying if I said this film didn't have some pacing issues and it,0.045461312
could have been better than it was especially with the action and the way that,0.021305833
it was filmed I really expected a little bit more out of this movie just,0.055608686
based on the character and how awesome you could make a black panther film just,0.009520108
take the character of Black Panther put him in this situation show his movesets and,0.032139678
his skills and how he can do flips and just take those calls and just,0.04759921
ah overall this is a competent movie I think it's a good first solo movie,0.0756387
for Black Panther is it as great as it could have been probably not and,0.1635354
I will just say this 10 years ago who would have ever thought we would,0.040596824
be seeing a solo Black Panther film like it's crazy we live in great times,0.07642494
right now I'm going to give the film Black Panther Oh a b-minus go check,0.06519132
the movie out it's a good time it's entertaining and it's a solid Marvel movie,0.054235082
with a great villain that doesn't happen very often in Marvel movies so that's my,0.080817156
