well guys it's spooky season and you know what that means horror reviews in particular,0.037382655
i wanted to talk about four silent horror films this year that i thought would,0.055753034
be really fascinating to talk about so anyway let's waste no more time and talk,0.045609646
about the cabinet of dr caligari the cabinet of dr caligari was directed by robert,0.02862751
vine and tells the story of francis who in turn tells us the story of,0.028588263
how he got involved with a strange hypnotist named dr caligari who uses a sleepwalking,0.11158389
man to commit heinous crimes this film was released in 1920 so this year it,0.13939522
is celebrating its 100 year anniversary so i absolutely had to talk about this film,0.03363368
but also this film has a very important place in horror history as it is,0.04398394
often seen as the first in a long line of feature-length horror films and i,0.041863997
think that is really fascinating and it's really interesting going back to this film and,0.02976963
seeing how much it has influenced the genre many years later this film was part,0.027720863
of the german expressionist movement that was going on at the time in germany and,0.03405474
i'm not going to spend too much time on that because it has a really,0.03331772
fascinating history i'm not going to go into the history or pretty much any of,0.047613844
the themes or thematic material that a lot of people go into because you can,0.026778962
perfectly find that anywhere on the internet i just wanted to talk about this movie,0.046707865
and how much i really enjoyed this this is actually my third time watching this,0.022418685
film but this is the moment that i really was like man i actually really,0.05007835
like this film a lot i love its visual splendor which is basically the reason,0.053214025
to watch the movie the visuals are fantastic in this film the angles nothing in,0.063791774
this film is at a right angle everything is at strange weird angles the lighting,0.061696447
is so strange because it's so unnatural because if you look at the shadows throughout,0.034268267
the film you might notice that they're actually painted onto the sets that really makes,0.012023195
these visual shots just so interesting and planned out and they're really beautiful to look,0.15209092
at this is a really good looking film and if you're looking for something with,0.022006271
a lot of style i don't think you have to look much farther than the,0.043748464
cabinet of dr caligari it's got just so much splendor and artistry in it and,0.03139334
it's very powerful to look at many directors have been influenced by this you see,0.02544394
this in the later horror films like dracula or frankenstein but also you see it,0.044322517
in later filmmakers such as tim burton who also does the weird thing of not,0.042587053
having everything at a right angle and even the character of cesar who is the,0.024441509
sleepwalker character that dr caligari has going around murdering people is very similar in look,0.3839142
to edward scissorhands and i think that's not a coincidence at all it was very,0.07054538
much a influential film for tim burton as it has been for a lot of,0.025855688
people and also i was surprised by how creepy i absolutely found this film the,0.15704986
character of dr caligari in fact the actor that plays him is extremely sinister in,0.08250472
this film there's just something about he has these very circular glasses that have this,0.05085063
dark black rim around them that make his eyes just pop out and it's really,0.16591875
creepy there is a continuous feeling of dread throughout this entire movie that really never,0.05892995
lets up and the visuals on top of that really make you feel like you're,0.024113573
in a dream world it just doesn't feel real which actually does go into parts,0.07964843
of the plot of the movie that go on later on which i'll say for,0.05644815
my spoilers section but yes the visuals are fantastic and i actually really enjoy this,0.03277094
story and how it is framed as this man is you know telling this other,0.029711759
man the story of dr caligari and i think that's really cool also the score,0.029262759
that was used for this film i'm not particularly sure if it was a score,0.035202183
that was written for the film or if this was a score that was added,0.02437632
much later with a restoration but it really sets the tone of this movie very,0.056457464
well i really enjoyed it a lot it's a lot of fun now of course,0.05103555
a lot of the things that this movie does seems a lot primitive now with,0.026470318
the way they you know draw basically odd the sets to make the shadows work,0.027157452
or you know the flimsy looking sets but that adds to the charm and really,0.025233742
this disorienting feeling that you feel throughout the entire film which leads into our spoiler,0.070989065
section so if you don't want to know anything about this 100 year old film,0.05042225
step away and return to this time code so that you don't get spoiled but,0.036770023
basically this movie is more or less a fever dream of our main character who,0.04309858
is actually insane at the end of the movie we figured this out that he's,0.08903483
been at an insane asylum this whole time and that dr caligari is actually the,0.06566959
director of this asylum and might not be a terrible person at all we see,0.25184113
that many of the people that our main character encounters throughout the film are actually,0.016086137
patience at this mental institution which i think is it's a really really good twist,0.121875614
but also it brings up the question of what was real and what was not,0.0128726335
and i think it is really apparent just due to the visual nature of the,0.017059965
film and how everything looks kind of off kilter and awkward and wrong it is,0.093511514
probably true that our main character is completely crazy and has lost his mind and,0.07879832
we're basically seeing a movie through the eyes of a madman and i think that,0.25534585
is extremely cool it's a great twist for this film however i will say that,0.04348239
i think that the twist can be a little confusing now this might not be,0.011640049
confusing for everybody but i will say i did watch this with my mom and,0.07653869
she was a little confused as to the ending of the film i think you,0.073250026
know maybe things could have been cleared up a little bit more it could have,0.09211264
also been the translation of the film that we were watching but nonetheless i think,0.013175958
the twist of this film is fantastic i think it's really intriguing and makes you,0.06354632
think of the film in a completely different way i also really like the way,0.016101435
the title cards are written in this film with this really unique interesting style of,0.022310259
you know showing us the text of the film i think it's really interesting i've,0.034061395
never seen another silent film really have text on the screen quite like this that's,0.02908715
so disorienting to watch and that is really this film completely summed up it is,0.06184678
disorienting it is dreamlike and it is absolutely a wonder to watch it is a,0.04520854
beautiful looking film and definitely just the influence of this film is shown throughout all,0.027820641
