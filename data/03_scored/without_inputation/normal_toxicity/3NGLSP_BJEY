Americans rights such as the right to vote,0.15221527
I felt like a history teacher saying that felt badass,0.3017693
I don't know why did I have like no coat on,0.13180175
and that's the whole point of the movie so MLK and his followers can get desegregated from southern law of Selma,0.07267184
so they can vote now going into this movie I thought it was just gonna base it off Martin Luther King Jr's life and the struggles he had a face although I did show the second part it didn't really show a whole lot of his life,0.06711035
there's usually movies such as Jay Edgar do that,0.058649443
and usually turns into quite a mess,0.4031568
he actually sets you up right from the get-go and it focuses on the much bigger picture with a great amount of focus,0.07081202
Selma was actually a pretty damn good movie the acting in this movie was just phenomenal,0.44203228
David oh yeah I had lo Lloyd Lloyd,0.16068682
I can't pronounce his name his portrayal of Martin,0.09629117
Luther King was extremely spot-on for some scenes,0.11197816
I thought I was actually watching Martin Luther King jr. he got so into character,0.07323829
I can imagine when the Oscars come around he's gonna get nominated for Best Actor,0.0846093
I mean,0.07710842
it's his movie they showed him in his glorifying moments,0.17778066
but what I love most about his portrayals that they covered parts of his life that not too many people know about because throughout the whole movie I was like are they gonna cover that because not only does it affect his character,0.08534623
but it also affects the civil rights movement in itself and they did cover it,0.06432114
I'm not gonna tell you what it is,0.10261026
but I was just another way for people to go against him,0.2049872
so he can fail his mission,0.15694472
he just showed that this legendary historical figure is vulnerable,0.12496269
and I thought it was a great balance of character,0.05837178
I mean even some of the supporting casts was really great like the woman who plays Coretta Scott King,0.18747531
yeah I don't know where her name is either,0.09451744
I feel really bad because they all have parts of where they stand out as their own character,0.18392827
and I thought it was really cool being translated to scream and a part of that had to do with the extremely well-written script and the dialogue going on between the characters you know the movie Lincoln with Daniel day-lewis,0.05042494
yeah we all know the dude owned that role those scenes,0.11034006
were he's talking to someone,0.1318359
and he's telling stories about his or something like that,0.06996455
as he's speaking you're like,0.07402809
yeah cool and you're taking something from his words same thing with a guy who plays Martin Luther King jr.,0.10176199
he's given his speeches and you're just really inspired by that I'm serious I had a big fat dumb smile on my face during love scenes,0.7687765
and when I got to the scenes of the civil rights movement holy that was extremely hard to watch this movie is rated pg-13,0.12356015
so they couldn't fully capture the brutality of the situation,0.1439495
so it was just enough to get to a point where it was horrifying since these activists got the kicked out of them just sucks what they had to go through,0.67417204
so they can be equal to everybody imagine like that being televised like in this movie,0.073603086
they wouldn't allow,0.11440103
it of course bill would still be awful to watch it got emotional for some scenes and for a movie I gotta give it props,0.21316408
now some parts in the movie like when it comes to the timeline,0.09604603
I thought was just done okay cuz they get to certain moments of the movie where you feel,0.09553442
it's important to MLK's mission and his cause,0.06657009
but then all of a sudden it just cuts away and they don't handle that situation anymore I wish I would know more about that but I know it's a movie and there's only so much they can cover cuz I am a huge fan of history,0.067716226
and it's always fun to know these little facts so summer was a great historical movie that was well directed,0.055700418
and had a well-written script David what's his face from rise of the plan of the apes,0.46338576
I hope he gets nominated for Best Actor and some of the supporting cast to some scenes were executed really good and some not so great,0.4748177
I wish they would cover more on some parts but I'm not gonna hold it entirely because of that so I say Selma is worth the full price in theaters because it is a silver screen gem have you guys seen Selma,0.07328741
