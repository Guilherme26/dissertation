it's the brand new movie from Alfonso Cuaron the director of such movies as gravity,0.08711206
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and one of my personal favorite movies of,0.047630478
all time children of men now to some Romo up in a nutshell it basically,0.49170426
follows this housemaid called Cleo in Mexico during the 1970s and how she deals with,0.0510626
certain things that happen around her and how she deals with some very drastic events,0.092243694
that occur in her life and you're basically just kind of peeking into the everyday,0.24890345
life of this maid I was really excited to see this movie for the main,0.13625892
reason that for the entire year is been doing the festival circuit and everything I've,0.03326371
heard about this movie has been incredibly positive every review of sin has been 5,0.1489304
stars 10 out of 10 really really positive I've only seen one negative review and,0.09942726
that's it every other review has been overwhelmingly positive which is why I went into,0.060462654
this movie with incredibly high expectations and also seeing the fact that this wasn't really,0.10473199
another big-budget film like gravity or Prisoner of Azkaban this was going kind of a,0.073533125
bit more to his roots and there's a bit more grounded in reality kind of,0.14447664
movies such as children of men and seeing how much I love that movie I,0.2118121
was expecting to be blown away by this one and I'm just gonna start by,0.18955517
saying that I really really like this movie and I'm glad I waited a week,0.0864828
to do this review because I actually watched this movie last Friday when it debuted,0.11305209
on Netflix and when I first saw it I thought okay this is good but,0.045515973
I don't quite see the hype around it now that I've had a week or,0.07366592
so to really process the movie a bit more and let it resonate with me,0.16004094
and let maybe sit on it a bit more and let it let me think,0.29205018
about a bit more I start to see why people love it so much and,0.14903058
that's why I'm glad I waited this long to do the review because if I,0.06940389
would have done the review straightaway after seeing it I don't think my review would,0.12928702
have been as coherent as I would have wanted it to be but now that,0.07988239
I've given it time to think about it you are getting my full honest opinion,0.09892023
on the movie and I've got to say I really really like this movie so,0.11689607
to start with I'm actually going to address my one and only criticism with the,0.055618122
movie first and then talk about what I really liked about the movie after that,0.08922734
my main problem with the film is that the first half of the movie is,0.06324643
very slow to get through and especially within the first 30 to 40 minutes it,0.10604541
kind of gave off this impression of like okay what I'm looking at is very,0.10576301
nice this is very nice-looking shots but what is the point of the stuff that,0.25471777
I'm seeing and it wasn't until about 40 50 minutes into the movie that it,0.085174166
started to click and then the second half of the movie happens and it flows,0.072269276
a lot smoother and just feels like it knows what it's doing a bit more,0.15023383
but unfortunately that first act sorry that first half of the movie just feels a,0.07964852
bit meandering and like it doesn't quite know where it's going plot wise it is,0.15346587
straightforward to watch but there is no exact point to the stuff you're seeing it's,0.071866415
only about halfway through the movie onwards where there really is a point to the,0.043293074
stuff you're seeing and it gets a lot better because of that apart from the,0.092955045
fact that the first act was quite slow and took a while to really get,0.12834738
to the point the rest of the movie is a sight to behold and features,0.049043164
some of the best filmmaking of sinal year what quorum is able to do with,0.08175353
the camera in this movie is utterly mind-boggling like especially seeing that with a story,0.15489477
like this you would expect it to be kind of a little bit like children,0.4669149
of men a lot of long takes with kind of iffy all over the place,0.15345153
camera work that is still very cohesive but you can still tell what's going on,0.09658052
that's not the case in Roma with Roma every single shot has a perfectionist quality,0.1497626
to it like all of the the shot compositions and the way things are lit,0.10935506
and just everything feels like they spent ages setting up each individual shot as perfectly,0.18219234
as they could and you wouldn't really expect that with a story like this but,0.06970487
the way that they choose to present it really works for the sake of this,0.042345993
movie and the cinematography in my opinion kind of like how the film plays out,0.06050524
just gets better and better as the film goes on specifically with a few moments,0.07865194
in particular that utilize some of currents like key film techniques which is like a,0.06013817
lot going on in one single shot and one moment in particular where this happens,0.15522282
is where Clio and another character are in a furniture shop and riot breaks off,0.07341015
outside of the shop it's one single shot but what they are able to pull,0.08940268
off in said shot is utterly brilliant and you can it's one of those movies,0.2575323
where so much is happening in these long unbroken takes that you can really appreciate,0.08345303
the amount of effort and coordination and skill that was used to pull off said,0.06584036
shots I don't really get that a lot with movies but when a movie does,0.083554015
come along and show off so much skill happening at once you just can't help,0.09554068
but sit back and appreciate what you're seeing and I definitely got that with Roma,0.05922362
there were some moments where I just kind of had to stop analyzing it for,0.0818046
a minute and really just take in the amount of filmmaking prowess and skill that,0.08301965
I was seeing on the screen just because of how impressive it is I also,0.05485994
thought the sound was quite interesting in this movie as well and sound really isn't,0.052999143
something that I talk about with movies that often unless it's the soundtrack this movie,0.06771136
doesn't have a soundtrack I mean the only music you really hear in the movie,0.08774803
is stuff that happens within the frame like if a marching band walks past you,0.04153089
hear them if someone turns a radio on you're hearing the music from the radio,0.20659365
apart from that there is no actual soundtrack or score that backs the movie that's,0.07697353
the only type of music you hear in the film and again it kind of,0.057150494
works there are a few points in the movie where the movie feels a bit,0.066804536
naked because it doesn't have a score then the movie just keeps going and you,0.35582274
kind of have to remember that he's going for this uber realistic feel so it,0.071043
kind of works because of that it's a bit of a tricky one it works,0.12115886
in some places for the most part but there are other points where it feels,0.033007033
like that could have benefited a little bit more from a really good school or,0.097621664
soundtrack especially near the end of the movie but yeah I thought that was quite,0.07267925
interesting the sound design is also bloody impressive here they use a lot of 3d,0.3842382
effects and what I mean 3d I don't mean popping out in front of you,0.1629992
I mean like they utilize every single space of sound like if something happens off,0.1536546
screen that that is just to the right you are hearing it from that direction,0.06952709
they take advantage of every aspect of where the sound is coming from and it,0.07571912
is bloody impressive it's hard to describe without actually seeing it and hearing it but,0.4031849
if you've seen the film you know exactly what I mean the acting is also,0.08623674
really good as well and what surprised me the most about this is that I,0.05108803
think almost everyone in the film is a first-time actor I can't remember their names,0.043891985
and I don't want to try pronouncing them just in case I butcher them but,0.42517352
the woman who plays Cleo in particular is really good in the movie and she's,0.244898
the one actress I definitely know as a first-time actor not sure about the others,0.0751397
but I have heard some people say that a lot of the actors in this,0.054706663
movie this is their first time properly acting and they are all really good especially,0.085401535
the child performances they don't get much to do but they're better than most child,0.14459223
performances I'll say that they're not annoying or taking up the main focus of the,0.08871975
movie they're just good for what their purpose in the movie is in the end,0.084734276
I really really like Troma I don't know if I love it just yet but,0.08285273
I think the more I watch this movie I think I'll just appreciate it more,0.056228906
and more with each viewing and I love those kind of movies movies that either,0.026554976
don't click with you at first viewing or you kind of like but want to,0.14090122
love in the future and they do that the more you watch it the more,0.05773299
you love it I'd love movies like that and I feel that Romo is one,0.10888792
of those movies one that I think is really good but I know I will,0.069004886
love years down the line the more I think about it appreciate it and re-watch,0.10405644
it which is why at this moment in time I'm going to give Romo an,0.06401087
8.5 out of 10 I know what you're thinking oh it should be a 10,0.064706296
or a 9 like I just said I know that in the future I will,0.064057715
appreciate this movie a whole lot more than I do now and that being said,0.07606234
I appreciate this movie quite a bit now especially from a filmmaking standpoint but at,0.07133347
this moment in time I think an 8.5 perfectly reflects how I feel about the,0.050519682
movie at the moment so guys that was my review of Romo and that's probably,0.123667225
going to be my last review of the year unless I end up seeing Aquaman,0.094383836
before the year is over then I will try my best to get review out,0.05069576
