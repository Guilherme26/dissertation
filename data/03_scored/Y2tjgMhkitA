hello everyone welcome back to my channel so what today's video is going to be,0.10839134
a little kind of do I want to call it a review I don't know,0.10083296
if I would consider it I guess it's a review right I don't know is,0.07014236
it a review you don't even know were talking about it okay well let's hold,0.16582653
a review because I guess it's kind of a review um what I'm trying to,0.06989687
say is I'm going to be talking today to you guys about the movie 8th,0.08489476
grade no I have here my boner my bo burnham shirt Boop can you see,0.8545538
it from my who do you okay are you okay okay coffee okay okay so,0.07765517
this is from when I went to go see a bow during his meet copy,0.07164721
show which was incredible I am a huge fan of Bo Burnham I have been,0.066380344
for several years now I absolutely love o Burnham if you know me you know,0.12072572
that because he is love him I watch him constant and i rewatch his same,0.15160415
specials over an over Doria like his songs like his you know comedy songs are,0.1581746
saved in my playlist of music that I listened to because because I love him,0.10792772
I am a huge fan of comedy in general and I grew up like with,0.056884676
comedy I mean I absolutely love it I love it if I have to say,0.16344772
I love Seattle comedian I could sit here and name every single Xena comedian that,0.06845339
has touched my life in one way or another but bo burnham is just absolutely,0.31089434
credible and that's everything I'm gonna say about that so yes maybe I'm a little,0.064413734
biased but I don't think so what I'm trying to say is since oh what,0.06392917
I'm trying to say is that laburnum so much when I found out that he,0.12543127
had a movie coming out which is the movie eighth grade I knew that I,0.09385255
liked how to see it as soon as it opened because I was very excited,0.12939787
and I'm he hasn't come out with like believe many projects within the last couple,0.07186371
years so make happy premiered on Netflix on June 3rd of 2016 and I saw,0.091741644
it in 2015 twice and then of course when it came on Netflix I watched,0.054242507
it like every day but after that it wasn't really much more that you heard,0.0943179
from him so when this movie came out I was very like I wasn't wasting,0.15116474
any time I was first in line to go see it and I knew as,0.035485126
soon as I saw it that I would have to make a video about it,0.08326393
and I knew that I hadn't talked about it because it was comedic in senses,0.09616426
of course it had a funny touch to it but it was it's a movie,0.07334893
that everyone should see let's just say that it was a movie but absolutely everyone,0.083858065
needs to see and parents need to have their children see this movie I mean,0.0933253
it is it needs to be watched it needs to be talked about it needs,0.059089974
to be out there for everyone to see it because it talks about real-life stuff,0.12860122
I mean it really does like it's called eighth grade for a reason it talks,0.12566464
about 8th grade it focuses on a young girl who's in raid and she was,0.29376718
going through real-life eighth-grade struggles I don't know about you guys but 8th grade wasn't,0.16438125
my prime time eighth grade was not necessarily my ear um I went to a,0.09350009
Catholic school my whole life and my school actually closed down in the 6th grade,0.41325602
so for a 7th and 8th grade I had to go to a different Catholic,0.10264613
school I had to remake friends I had to graduate with people that I didn't,0.07225112
know for very long I was the only person going to my high school so,0.06819074
I had to make these friends and then say goodbye to them all right away,0.09554431
eighth grader like wasn't the best and also aside from that like eighth grade was,0.22013246
not the best in my personal life I mean it was the year I lost,0.08977999
my father to a heart attack so like that was really tough on that end,0.20206209
of the spectrum but just in a very you know in a relatable way eighth,0.05828441
grade was just not great I mean it wasn't great for anybody I don't even,0.20785446
know like trying to think about it I don't think eighth grade was really that,0.09225554
also more like that memorable or fun for really anybody um but when you're in,0.106409185
eighth grade it seems like your whole world I mean when you're living that day,0.3901465
today as a 13 14 year old kid I mean that's all you know that,0.16018373
that that's what you wake up and you know you're going to school and you're,0.25494367
going to see the Mean Girls and you're gonna see the hot kid that you,0.72064567
like and you're going to have maybe not one friend that like kind of understands,0.19318247
you but you also don't really know if you guys are actually great friends because,0.117344566
you know maybe there was a rumor going around or maybe something happened or whatever,0.092341736
I mean an eighth grade such trivial stuff happens I mean we all know that,0.09895954
but this movie just focused on those real life experiences and it really talked about,0.084056
what actually goes on and it just it really showed what it is actually like,0.053056497
but aside from that I need it don't get me wrong it made me really,0.099873856
a very awful awkward terrible moment that I had as a 14 year old in,0.44569406
eighth grade getting ready to go to high school it was terrible but it also,0.16234314
just kind of gives you hope as an adult even just knowing that tough times,0.15145633
don't last you know as much as it focuses on all these bad things there's,0.11310738
that silver lining of the fact that good things like good things are possible and,0.044505727
good things will happen and 8th grade isn't the end-all be-all and I think that,0.12353807
goes for every every stagnant point that we have in our life when we feel,0.09888307
like we come to you know a halt and if we have a hiatus of,0.16994378
positivity if it seems like nothing good is happening and we're at a standstill we,0.06354509
have to know we have to know him to understand that those moments aren't our,0.07160083
ending I mean they're not the finalization of our lives it's just a tough time,0.1933819
and we get through it and we learn from Anna we grow from it and,0.11483167
we go on to the next moment and that's how it works but when you're,0.05072088
young eighth grade seems like such a big year because it's the last year before,0.12448763
you go into high school and I mean people are finally you're starting to come,0.2019919
into their bodies and and and we're learning all these new things and we're having,0.10357937
all these new experiences and it's it's a crazy time and it's an exciting time,0.2405292
in a scary time and an awful time and it's just took everything all at,0.13669015
once are wrapped up in tied to the bow and that's what 8th grade hands,0.15755941
to us but like I said looking back on it as a 21 year old,0.17751767
now I realize that III wasn't everything but when you're in eighth grade it is,0.15217851
everything to you I mean it's all that you're living it's what your day-to-day is,0.19547966
and it's not always great and I don't think it's a bad thing to say,0.08483848
that because it's not and that movie touches on every single one of those emotions,0.15434007
I laughed I cried I cringed a lot a lot but in good ways I,0.099001035
cringed because it was just so relatable and so truthful and so authentic it wasn't,0.051376957
a try-hard movie it wasn't trying to relate to younger kids it was just so,0.054462567
genuine I mean it was what every single person that has gone to eighth grade,0.24181093
has felt like and lived through and and been in and it was just it,0.05669724
was authentic and that that is what drew me in and as much as I,0.09216722
love Bo Burnham you know this was in a movie about Boober about bo burnham,0.24585493
this wasn't this wasn't watching him on stage and a t-shirt and jeans for an,0.10614664
hour telling those jokes I mean so it wasn't the fact that Bob Arnold made,0.07411694
this movie that made me love it it was how authentic it was that really,0.1252435
drew me in and allowed me to appreciate it so much more than I would,0.15516669
have if it was a movie that was just trying too hard sorry clip had,0.077719525
to come out but it was really you know mater's uh-huh but when I found,0.08813711
out that the movie was rated R um I was I was just kind of,0.068068616
really shocked and frustrated because this is a movie like I said that touches that,0.1332852
touches on all those bad things and it doesn't hide the fact that those bad,0.16811958
things happen and that III isn't a glory here but it gives hope on how,0.08699758
to get through that and how to understand that better things to come and but,0.089866735
there is always going to be positivity that leads after something negative has happen and,0.06934931
that is important for kids that are actually in eighth grade to see and to,0.0992297
know and to understand we shouldn't be taught those things years after it happens it,0.073127255
should be rated R for people who have already made it past that tough point,0.060521938
who already understand that and yeah it's a friendly reminder like I mentioned earlier to,0.058099907
adults to always be aware and always to understand that good things do come and,0.081455916
that negativity doesn't last forever but it's very important and kind of almost made for,0.04182849
eighth graders to understand that you are going through these tough times you are living,0.17717315
these sometimes terrible situations that seem like your whole life that seem like this is,0.32870734
everything that's ever going to happen for you um and and and it's important for,0.076881036
them to kind of see this because when you're when you're at that age or,0.12983574
when you're in those experiences and living those moments sometimes you feel like you're the,0.060941804
only person going through that bad moment you feel like you're the only person that,0.20290726
suffering negative we are going through a rough times and you don't understand all the,0.15694621
time that other people and most other people are actually going through those same times,0.06740334
as well and you know we're at a point where everyone's trying to impress other,0.035507813
people are trying to live up to society's standards and that's a whole other topic,0.07459377
oh of course it all ties back together but you know it when we're going,0.08106827
through that we don't want to admit to these bad things we don't want to,0.11199747
allow other people to see us weak or to make other people think that we,0.19268796
don't have our lives together and I mean at 14 years old like doesn't even,0.18900444
really have their life together at 21 years old do I have my life together,0.085755296
we don't need it we don't need that but like I'm saying it's hard and,0.09741182
it's difficult sometimes at that agent at any age really but especially when you're at,0.081382245
that age because that's when everyone's really trying to fit in I mean middle school,0.08769401
is really the beginning of that in many cases and it started younger and younger,0.04377069
every day but it Grange is kind of the culmination of all of that but,0.12406241
you know it's tough to admit that and since nobody is really getting the courage,0.11597984
to admit that it's it's you know people are kids are ignorant to the fact,0.6342261
that other kids are going harlot so you seem alone in that feeling but this,0.5154597
movie really touches based on the fact that so many other kids are going through,0.11594222
it majority of these kids are going through it and that's why it's incredibly frustrating,0.12247047
to a viewer like myself who appreciates them to be so so much to know,0.14382024
that it was raining hard because the kids that really need to see it that,0.08401807
really need to have this understanding and this mindset from a young age that they,0.08272087
can get past it more easily and that they can be aware that at all,0.026032576
times and not have to learn in seven years later they need to see this,0.111737065
movie to know those things and to learn those lessons because not everyone is is,0.055653833
teaching them that not everyone is talking to them about that and a movie like,0.08384376
this shows it from an eighth graders perspective it shows it from a fourteen year,0.068212695
olds point of view so that's what they need to see and the fact that,0.070426494
it was written or it's just it's just it's just it's frustrating and I don't,0.08665163
even have words for because it's just incredibly it's just it's just so frustrating that's,0.1141384
like the only where they could come to my mind right now even describe it,0.086237356
because it just bothers me a lot so parents I encourage you to show this,0.08257504
movie to your children teachers I encourage you to recommend this movie if you can't,0.19306116
show it in the classroom I recommend that you guys you know tell your students,0.06941787
about this movie allow them to be aware of it because it is a great,0.09077383
film it's it has a great message it's wonderful for young people to see and,0.08886496
I think it's very important and beneficial and crucial for these young kids to see,0.10971733
because it touches base on so many things that they need to be aware of,0.07140543
and if nobody's telling them about it then they're not going to have the ability,0.10739265
to see and I think it's really important that they do so yes all in,0.038058415
all I guess I'm just trying to say is I think April was wonderfully executed,0.1943026
I think it touched base on real life either in experiences in such a beautiful,0.08048768
way cringe-worthy way yes comedic way at times heart-wrenching yes of course I mean all,0.1858575
these things but it was so real it was so relatable it was so authentic,0.050500743
and so genuine and I absolutely loved every single second of it even the second,0.06302266
thought I was cringing because I know that that's how eighth grade really was and,0.18565738
this movie just it just did it it just completely completely did it and I,0.06496662
could not be more thankful for everyone who was involved we of course will burn,0.24074343
them for for making the movie and and and just you know of course executing,0.377868
the movie but to everyone who had a part in it it just thank you,0.08021383
thank you for your time thank you for your energy thank you for being a,0.050846715
part of spreading the message and like I said parents teachers adults who are in,0.06397879
the lives of children you know in eighth grade or younger or in high school,0.31089434
whatever it might be whoever whoever you have in your life that might be going,0.3062586
through this type of moment I encourage you to really share this with them because,0.083024375
it could really really be life-changing and I just recommend this movie to everyone oh,0.14589265
thank you thank you thank you thank you so much for everything you've ever done,0.09545893
I mean I could make a whole other video on just the positivity that you've,0.19211635
brought into my life before this movie ever even came out I mean I'm talking,0.24153075
three years ago four years ago you helped me through a really rough time in,0.06284905
my life incredibly rough time in my life you were there for me without even,0.24048135
knowing that you are of course but your your comedy and your words and just,0.31089434
the way that you talk about life and just everything everything that you have done,0.09442149
and your professional career and just it's just really helped me it's gotten me through,0.08929184
some of the toughest times of my life I truly credit you with saving my,0.08283904
life and I know that's a statement and that's a it's very very intense words,0.06619839
but it's truth and I you know I love you for it and I could,0.051156357
not be more thankful for them like I said this is could be me being,0.109208
biased but it's not maybe who highest it's really the truth a three-room is a,0.07403384
wonderful movie like I said thank you both for doing this collab to see you,0.13361213
