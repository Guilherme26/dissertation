oh for sakes god i started out hating this man and now i've cried for,0.60473084
him twice oh god his light went out oh god so i thought i probably,0.13913435
better record a little greeting in the case of my timely death what a funeral,0.24028072
i love you three thousand oh my god oh god proof that tony stark has,0.08908391
a heart oh my heart really hurts you know why i hurt so much because,0.10169187
he did it all out of selflessness and i started off thinking that he was,0.15267953
the most selfish that i have ever seen in any film or tv show that,0.4604563
i had ever seen and he went out doing something so selfless for the rest,0.07174182
of the world despite the fact that he has a family and he and he,0.07515879
wanted to he didn't want to give that up he made that abundantly clear but,0.06224538
when it came down to it tony stark has a heart he does oh man,0.13063522
fury it's so good to see fury oh god i'm such a mess i have,0.26342395
no path i do have a ride though move it or lose it airbag oh,0.05413901
wow he's gonna go into space that's awesome i really want to know the galaxy,0.15166993
back together again you should fight one another for the honor of leadership oh my,0.18099771
god it's not necessary i got some blasters you guys sorry please use knives on,0.44716057
board there shall be no knifing one another everybody knows who's in charge right yes,0.06780906
this is so awkward two one what the heck what the heck he's had oh,0.52301705
i know i know what he's done he's going back to his skinny self or,0.43288735
his child self or his old self i don't know anymore oh his old self,0.5526157
i said maybe uh try some of that life tony was telling me to get,0.14063837
it's beautiful oh i'm happy for you that makes me really happy to hear that's,0.15160108
a really good ending for him he's gonna give his suit to him wow now,0.33207634
it's bucky's turn to turn old again then they can be old besties together you,0.5009965
want to tell me about her no no i don't think i will oh oh,0.17867732
oh that makes me really happy you got a second chance with a oh god,0.13924648
i love love there's no end credit scenes i'm not used to that what's happened,0.0764189
that makes me so sad so it's been a really long day it is now,0.11297285
9 53 p.m and i got my hair done this very day and i got,0.12689605
it in memory of gamora and i don't know a little part of me thought,0.061352316
that maybe a version of her would still exist but sadly gamora is nomura she's,0.16331409
definitely nomura just like the black widow and it does make me sad this movie,0.16939119
was really sad the first two hours was super depressing uh you could probably tell,0.20707986
that whilst i was reacting to it i was in a pretty somber mood the,0.07854151
mood was definitely not upbeat i was definitely not feeling as bubbly and as chirpy,0.12598564
as some of the other films have made me feel and that was to be,0.093915194
expected because this film is the conclusion of this grand story that we've been following,0.06735526
along for well you guys have been following along for 10 years i've been following,0.058088467
along for a few months now um and it just came to a close so,0.05444193
mixed feelings is pretty much a given i think for this one um the first,0.13162045
two hours was a little bit slow because we were just kind of catching up,0.21205123
with what was going on it was 23 days after infinity war and we were,0.11641311
just catching up on how everybody's feeling five years after they first approached tony they,0.054636326
actually start making movements with their new mission pretty sure we got to see pretty,0.14121613
much every single mcu character except for probably jane's friends it was really nostalgic i,0.09033969
can't imagine how you guys would have felt seeing all of these scenes because you,0.14869851
had the actual weight that i didn't have i saw these all very recently so,0.09251851
it's not as nostalgic for me i'm sure i'll feel nostalgic after a few more,0.09551747
years if i decide to rewatch endgame there was definitely a lot to unpack i,0.039100096
feel like everyone including tony had a really nice conclusion obviously tony passed away he,0.11205813
died he is no longer a father to his beautiful daughter morgan he's no longer,0.55336374
a husband to his beautiful peppa but the way he went out was really noble,0.2664947
and really honorable and i don't think that anybody else could have done it he,0.100397274
started this amazing world with iron man and i really couldn't have imagined it to,0.10642044
go any other way i mean sure maybe the hulk could have done it it,0.08084589
wouldn't have had the payoff as it did uh with tony because tony's character development,0.13996048
has just gone full circle i could not be more proud of tony and how,0.1019416
far he's come i do want to talk about thor as well because i feel,0.10995085
like he had definitely the saddest story that we've seen he is on his own,0.1530366
now he joined the outcasts the guardians of the galaxy everyone in that crew doesn't,0.05299064
really have a family or a place to belong but they belong with each other,0.05822064
so i am glad that thor got to have a place to belong in the,0.095157005
end because he lost all of his family members he lost all of his best,0.27596766
friends sif included and you know how i feel about sif and thor i wanted,0.06912354
them to have a happy ending and a nice romance but that never happened and,0.17084806
his character definitely changed a lot throughout this entire series we saw him as a,0.055721313
very arrogant jerk in the first thor movie and then he found love and he,0.8599691
got to experience earth and what it was like to be amongst humans and he,0.076039195
experienced loss and he experienced family drama including his crazy sister heller and his chaotic,0.46396935
brother loki constantly testing his character i especially like how taika waititi made thought a,0.10502368
lot less boring in the third thor film so i certainly appreciated his style of,0.17782955
directing in that one um i was super sad to see natasha go the way,0.13089415
she did but hawkeye has a family he has a wife and natasha as sad,0.24505143
as it is she doesn't really have any of that she was quite alone all,0.14631951
she really had was the avengers so i pretty much predicted that natasha would die,0.55576897
i did not think originally that tony stark would die i did see someone say,0.4271661
that tony stark would die because i asked people to give me fake spoilers i,0.557586
assumed it was a fake spoiler that was certainly really unexpected for me i really,0.1195236
liked seeing captain america's conclusion as well i really liked the ending clint god as,0.0921197
well and then also seeing ant-man and hope and cassie in the end as well,0.2416987
embracing there were a lot of heartwarming moments for sure i love seeing wanda again,0.084097765
i love seeing captain marvel again and doctor strange a lot of people showed up,0.09323862
to do their bit but we didn't get all the screen time with them so,0.092290185
if they happen to be your favorite characters you might have been a bit disappointed,0.23348826
but for me i was quite happy with how everything panned out it didn't have,0.06966382
the comedy element that some of the other mcu movies have but i think that,0.09567871
if there was comedy in this or if i had laughed as much as i,0.11724553
did in saito or guardians of the galaxy or even avengers the first one it,0.07359705
wouldn't have felt like the conclusion of a huge superhero franchise i must say that,0.06670406
i didn't think they would dive into time travel in the quantum realm but once,0.058286574
ant-man made an appearance and he came out of the quantum realm and he observed,0.24023889
his findings and he learned and he came up with this hypothesis i was like,0.08680308
this is starting to make sense they might be able to time travel without the,0.07627492
time travel infinity stone and when i was wrapping up my infinity war movie reaction,0.14890423
video i was saying something like if there's a way they can go back in,0.113780566
time or if there's a way to go to thanos get the time infinity stone,0.09205843
there might be a way to bring people back and i wasn't exactly right but,0.059711967
they definitely did use time to try and save their story and i'm glad they,0.044003047
did it in a less obvious way in a way that tied into everything very,0.10634772
well and it made a lot of sense i think the pacing could have been,0.040072978
a little bit better if i were to rank the avengers infinity war movie against,0.17619105
the avengers endgame movie i'd probably say i was more invested in infinity war just,0.106538065
because i really loved the pacing and there was comedy there was action there were,0.07101881
a lot of emotional moments it was heavy it was deep and thanos won which,0.06585381
completely shook me because it skewed my perception of what a typical superhero movie is,0.10376989
we've got the superhero genre that tells us that the hero has a journey and,0.031159287
this is the way it's meant to be and that didn't happen in infinity war,0.22606091
so it just shocked me to my core i was very thrown because i knew,0.13577545
that after end game there was spider-man i did know in my heart of hearts,0.096661925
that the heroes will end up winning whereas in infinity war i had no idea,0.08812575
and that aspect threw me off i think it was infinity war where i saw,0.23439427
everybody dying in the first 10 minutes and i was like what the heck is,0.42119953
going on whereas with endgame i was a little bit more prepared and more well,0.07125711
oiled for the tragedy so those were my thoughts i'm sorry that it was kind,0.1123149
of all over the place and so i might not have said everything that i,0.15511574
wanted to say but those were all of my thoughts at this very moment after,0.10719572
i have watched endgame they're quite raw i'll probably have more things to say about,0.10278909
it as time progresses so yeah let me know what you guys thought of this,0.09600528
film in the comment section below the first time you watched it and give this,0.080188975
