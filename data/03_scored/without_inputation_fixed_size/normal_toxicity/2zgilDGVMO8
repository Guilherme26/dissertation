this guy he wrote and directed this film and it's something he wanted to make,0.15436986
for a very long time now this is a black and white foreign film set,0.06094799
in Mexico in a different language so a lot of people might have a hard,0.06823681
time getting into it because of that now this film was on various film festivals,0.06695588
where it won some of them and was very well received and now it was,0.044768482
picked up by Netflix and what's good I guess is that Netflix is going to,0.049883932
open up this film to a lot more people that otherwise wouldn't see it because,0.08197625
a lot of these foreign films don't really get seen by wider audiences so that,0.105600946
is pretty good Hurra lead actress in this film is yalitza apprec I and she,0.09963111
was really good as the maid Cleo in this film she had a very quiet,0.15362038
reserved miss to her performance but you can tell so much about just the expressions,0.0800352
on her face and the way she carries herself through these various scenes she was,0.18487802
really good now this movie is set in the 1970s in Mexico City and it,0.053825192
follows the life of this middle-class family and they're made for an entire year now,0.08397295
there's not much of an overall plot per se is more so just like you're,0.15100048
living which with this family and you're very immersed in their life for this time,0.23175399
period now I have to say this has got to be one of the most,0.101018
overhyped films I've ever seen love reviews are calling this a richly textured masterpiece the,0.0912856
most exquisite and artistic film of the year the best picture of the year the,0.040378436
best film of the decade some people saying this movie brought them to tears people,0.092689745
saying that this is just like the greatest movie ever made so going into this,0.06793134
film my expectations were super super high and I when I came out of it,0.18827248
I felt honestly kind of sonot and i almost feel like I'm going to be,0.15072577
attacked or there's something wrong with me because I did not love this movie like,0.22190781
so many people did so that's where I'm a little bit at a crossroads with,0.058783732
this film and the overhype did not really help matters now I have to say,0.08307387
there still are a lot of positives of this film it is well directed there,0.14127001
are some beautiful shots in this some scenes that come to mind are this Ocean,0.18222232
Beach shot this tracking shot where they made is on this Beach and then all,0.18101192
of a sudden one of the kids is drowning so she goes and runs into,0.15949993
the ocean and the way this tracking shot just follows her from the beach over,0.20340542
the water into the ocean and then back again or sometimes she's the characters are,0.062440626
just moving through the streets of Mexico City and we have this tracking shot over,0.30866793
the streets beautiful stuff there there's this one scene where Cleo the maid is giving,0.10396491
birth and we're on her for such a really long time and I mean really,0.19139625
beautiful cinematography in this film there's another scene where they're in a movie theater and,0.08021458
it's like this really long shot of that and we see these characters in the,0.09528175
background just these background characters and they almost have their own little stories and it's,0.03350467
like things going on there that you can almost just watch this couple making out,0.1490046
in front of them a few rows ahead and they have their almost own little,0.067551285
story you know they're just in the background so stuff like that was really great,0.09648385
now on to some of the negatives for this film while it is very immersive,0.10916853
following this family and seeing their real life it is also just very mundane and,0.11666417
boring and there's really not much of a story here now this is a very,0.1525446
long movie two hours and 15 minutes but I think they only have about an,0.06799557
hour worth of story here and it just drags out for that long runtime because,0.093633525
the director loves to indulge himself with these long shots now this movie opens up,0.117500626
you have four minutes of just seeing this water on the floor the intro credits,0.15474908
are rolling apparently you know the maid is mopping but it's four minutes of just,0.10117273
watching water splash on the floor finally we pan up to the maid and then,0.07833009
we slowly watch her bring the mop down this hallway and then she puts it,0.24182224
in this little like storage closet or something and she goes inside this closet and,0.30403748
she shuts the door and then it is literally a 30-second shot of this doorway,0.28038213
and where she's maybe changing in there or something but it's literally 30 seconds of,0.08227071
the movie of just this doorway nothing else she finally comes out of that doorway,0.17391375
and then she goes into the house so we're talking to be the first six,0.08731944
minutes or so of the movie and we've done nothing finally she's walking through the,0.12607874
house and we see her clean a bit finally have some interactions with the kids,0.2548173
but a lot of the movie is just this these long drawn-out shots that go,0.16540262
on forever mind you it looked beautiful the some of these shots were very nice,0.2794714
but he's really stretching the time here and so much of the movie is just,0.07069679
that it's these super long shots done because they look beautiful but they have no,0.27519774
real merit to the overall story sometimes and they're what I like to call masturbatory,0.69510025
directing it's the director kind of indulging himself and saying oh this is going to,0.13726728
look beautiful and really taking his time to do these long shots but not adding,0.17709497
much to the overall story and it really really drags out the story at times,0.063424975
and makes it slow and very kind of boring now when I got to the,0.15918332
midway point of this movie I really wanted to bail I wanted to bail on,0.14248933
this movie but it was all of these positive reviews calling this the best film,0.08233719
of the decade that made me be like no I have to sit through this,0.07494747
movie and see it through to the end to see how good or bad this,0.12128473
movie really is so I watched the entire thing and I never really got over,0.08403231
that slow miss of the movie and these long scenes so while they look technically,0.1501671
beautiful there is not much here to this overall story and it can really drag,0.13041386
on at times overall while I from an intellectual perspective appreciated the artistic Ness of,0.08671818
this film it was too drawn-out and boring and suffered from a director masturbating to,0.901791
his own work metaphorically speaking I did not love this movie I liked it and,0.14044386
I think it is worth watching to see some of these scenes but I did,0.099974625
not love it and it is not my favorite film of the year and it,0.06832469
is okay to not like this movie as well it is okay to love this,0.16052853
movie if you're super into it as well but for me I would give this,0.10665084
film a 7.5 out of 10 not too bad but not the greatest film of,0.058288738
