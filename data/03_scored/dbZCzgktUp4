spotlight is the most important movie about investigative journalism since all the president's men but,0.09542792
for some reason it's not making the same impression with the general public which I,0.09429189
found incredibly frustrating when I was leaving the theater because I thought the movie was,0.07041188
so good I was like man why are more people talking about this why is,0.13096733
almost everyone in this theater a senior citizen why is spotlight getting swept under the,0.09753143
rug so I saw this movie on Saturday night and I thought about it and,0.109938495
I thought about it and I not only came up with two reasons why this,0.08184863
movie isn't getting more coverage and is it making more of an impression but also,0.055764675
in the course of finding out those two reasons and discovering them I also came,0.087471776
to the realization that the movie is deeply flawed but you should still see it,0.12007396
and I'm gonna tell you why but first why spotlight is not connecting the first,0.074922115
is that and these are my own investigative notes that I have right here the,0.040158387
first is that there are some things that the public no matter how horrific and,0.15101148
unjust they're just not willing to acknowledge and it seems that the dark side of,0.14401701
the Catholic Church is one of those things I mean just look at the aftermath,0.11867388
of this story actually breaking because this is a true story the Catholic Church still,0.13394551
around and nobody really seems to want to confront this look at all the people,0.1999778
who showed up to see the Pope even though they know yeah well I don't,0.085142195
want to give away the details of the story because I think they're very important,0.08887954
to discover along with the film but I think you'll be surprised when the film,0.057898708
is done that the Catholic Church seems so unscathed and despite of everything that's happened,0.25529
and I think that you know in contrast I'm going to contrast law with all,0.07613607
the president's men because they're similar films nobody has an emotional attachment to the government,0.24196322
so people were happy to have that change how they felt about the government so,0.060178284
you saw a much bigger actual reaction from the public when they learned about that,0.07982591
scandal than the church scandal so the the public basically the number one thing is,0.104891
the public has already said we're not interested in the church Catholic Church scandal we're,0.13879569
not going to acknowledge it so perhaps open road is aware of this so that's,0.072068855
why they've created it the number two reason this movie isn't connecting and that's because,0.06670653
open road and I think that's a some degree the film itself an open road,0.07049467
is the distributor I've decided that this is a movie about investigative journalism only and,0.069278665
that's all they're focusing on I saw some awards coverage actually variety reach retweeted it,0.09823785
out or sent to that as an email to people on their email lists and,0.079620995
I'm one of them being like did you miss this spotlight discussion because nobody's talking,0.18295735
about spotlight and they were like oh it's talking about investigative journalism that's what this,0.081792556
movie is about and I'm like no I don't think this movie is totally about,0.093384594
investigative journalism and you know that's that's the wrong play here I mean think about,0.12547113
just even the title of the movie it's spotlight whereas the title of all the,0.040068824
president's men referenced the scandal but this movie's title references to people who uncovered the,0.15382113
scandal and while intellectually that might be the right hook because of number one with,0.15789212
people saying you know what I don't want to acknowledge the Catholic Church scandal emotionally,0.35214776
it's not the right play and it's not enough I think oh poor investigative journalism,0.14159912
that's not enough to get people to really pay attention to this movie now of,0.087127395
course investigative journalism is important is important and this movie is about investigative journalism and,0.07896462
actually when I was watching the film I was like wow these people should be,0.061572064
paid more this is just horribly you know this is unjust as well and I,0.30432647
would actually liken it to Trumbo a movie also playing right now the people also,0.10065618
aren't paying any attention to that talks about the importance of screenwriting and I think,0.07388838
that both of these movies highlight how we're becoming a culture devoid of substance or,0.11886438
at least where substance is not valued and that that's pretty alarming all by itself,0.13868737
but investigative journalism particularly in this context and in the context of all the president's,0.09745406
men but even more so here because wait wait for it wait for it because,0.13144433
I've done the work that this movie only a little bit did investigative journalism is,0.14997083
just the tool and the real story here is the scandal and the people who,0.067341894
uncovered that scandal now what the with the scandal Mark Ruffalo's character I mean they,0.0772921
the movie touches on these things but it doesn't do a good enough job of,0.10326864
driving at home it's like it's like investigative journalism that just puts all the facts,0.06550946
up there but doesn't frame it for you doesn't give it a voice doesn't give,0.10143654
a perspective and that's what I think this movie is missing to some degree I,0.07733071
would liken it a little bit to the wolf of Wall Street for Martin Scorsese,0.07869172
which also failed to have a creative voice to have perspective to have you have,0.16409424
the film to have itself and offer some kind of judgment not judgment as in,0.08810856
what's right or wrong but you know again you know a few point but anyway,0.086684495
Mark Ruffalo's character says something very interesting during the movie and he says when he,0.065576784
fit when he learns the actual details of what happened with the church over decades,0.06670143
something in his belief of the church cracks it just cracks and I thought kind,0.16630124
of had a similar experience as well watching the movie and I think that they,0.06494877
as I said with Watergate people didn't have an emotional connection to the government so,0.093208976
they were willing to be like yeah the government is evil oh thanks for telling,0.34621695
me uh you know Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward I appreciate it but here this,0.116706245
is the church this is a big part of people's lives it's their Savior it's,0.108620875
God so people are like I don't want to know why'd you tell me so,0.1851638
I think that's kind of the reaction that's there you know the incredible faith and,0.032056246
how much this meat and what the church means to people and what you're asking,0.14085944
them to give up by acknowledging that these things that we're done and the movie,0.062336124
has the opportunity to go there with Rachel McAdams grandmother a character that is so,0.054225348
underutilized that you're like well why was she in this movie if not to make,0.17556341
this point so they could have done it they could have stressed that and I,0.060668875
don't think they do for instance I believe that rachel mcadams grandmother continues to go,0.09890846
to church after after this movie and I think that that should have been made,0.087916106
more clear then is for the people who discovered the scandal the movie touches on,0.14925611
the importance that the globe the Boston Globe the paper in question suddenly found itself,0.104707696
with outsiders in key positions which allow this story to finally come to light Liev,0.12541306
Schreiber's editor editor in chief he's playing a terran chief a Jewish individual and a,0.05516603
you know who better to be willing to call out the Catholic Church right Mark,0.21105868
Ruffalo's investigative reporter who very much is an outsider you know very bad social skills,0.26017404
etc and also Stanley Tucci's lawyer who you know from you'll see in the film,0.05669314
underlines what he feels that he's an outsider okay and that's what it took to,0.09788005
break a story that was covered up by one of the most insider II towns,0.07323044
cities in the world Boston and actually they have an insider in the spotlight team,0.08599684
played by Michael Keaton's character and there's a startling discovery that he makes towards the,0.058814418
end of the film about his own coverage of this story which I think wasn't,0.058597762
spotlighted enough they should have done a better job juxtaposing insiders versus outsiders and i,0.12036594
think that it's wonderful to see a movie highlight the importance of outsiders and that,0.07198986
they do a lot of work you know it's the checks the system of checks,0.0784777
and balances and without the outsiders you know the insiders can get away with anything,0.07907334
and I think that just to show you how strong a combination faith and insider,0.0682981
status can be that's the exact same thing that happened at Penn State with their,0.07091461
molestation scandal with Jerry Sandusky who was molesting students for 15 years at the school,0.5154597
because people had too much financially invested in the football institution of the program they,0.03823932
had a lot emotionally attached to the school they loved the culture of being part,0.0969848
of the school on the sports system the alumni and also people believed in that,0.040105153
it was like the heart of the school the sports program the football team and,0.030468589
they didn't want to blacken it with something that was unfortunately deaf but you know,0.40313804
they were willing to let people suffer like this just like what happened with the,0.16142285
church so that just shows you you know how potent and how ugly the combination,0.55291736
of faith and insider status is now with the film itself the craftsmanship of the,0.051594928
film I think as a result of all these things that are missed the directing,0.08161283
in the script are weak and Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams just go through the,0.19461071
motions I think their performances are poor yeah not like embarrassing but I think it's,0.24068294
embarrassing that they didn't do the work they needed to do all of these people,0.24073993
the director of the writer Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams but that doesn't mean this,0.050854214
movie is devoid of great performances because the outsiders really do a fantastic job I,0.10040703
I've never seen Liev Schreiber so understated it was really cool to watch I've never,0.14488447
seen would quite look like this I thought that the makeover they gave him really,0.060794942
did a lot and he did such a wonderful job with his character Stanley Tucci,0.054102838
always of the light but I really liked his performance here there was a seriousness,0.07975751
to it that we haven't seen with him in a long time he's usually become,0.11230515
a bit of a clown kind of like an arthouse Johnny Depp but he was,0.7207242
very very good here but I thought that the real standout was actually Mark Ruffalo,0.062861346
who and all of these gentlemen are doing fantastic character acting but mark ruffalo made,0.19789353
such strong character actor choices and I've never seen him portray a character like this,0.06887527
before but yet it was someone I instantly real recognized from you know real life,0.12512091
that it was so great to see him bring that character to life on there,0.06832098
on the big screen I also want to give a shout out to the actors,0.13008194
who played the victims who I think did a fantastic job of portraying people who,0.15816066
you can see why they were targeted because of the horrible situations they found themselves,0.18559773
in but yet they were a very diverse group but also every one of them,0.059923213
seemed like such wonderful people they pointed out that none of them deserve to have,0.24057601
this happen to them and that they were people too people had have been cast,0.15658195
aside by the insiders who had too much to lose so finally in conclusion spotlight,0.096279554
is not a masterfully crafted film it's not even a well-crafted film because of all,0.10478169
the things that it fails to do you know to really dive into here but,0.06474332
it's a good enough film and the story that it depicts is so amazing and,0.041227207
so thrilling and all these elements can be taken from the movie if you know,0.11653794
you let it sink in then I think it is a hundred and ten percent,0.25901887
worth seeing and as a filmed you know anyone who's interested in filmmaking I think,0.14300738
it's also fascinating to see what the movie misses and how it doesn't go for,0.06404434
it far enough and I've actually been hearing a similar thing about concussion the concussion,0.11842969
has a great story all the tools it needs but it doesn't go far enough,0.08898409
and so I'm nervous but I hope that is not the case there as well,0.08063044
so that's my review of spotlight thank you everybody thank you for those of you,0.15540056
who insisted I go see this because it's not getting a lot of coverage people,0.13596357
aren't that interested in it but I do think it's worth your time I look,0.122481756
forward to continuing the conversation down below and you can check out some other episodes,0.07595704
