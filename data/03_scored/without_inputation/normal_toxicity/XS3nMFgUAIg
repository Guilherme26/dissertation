so for the july 2019 great film throwback day,0.04741273
we are finally gonna talk about the film that when i did my little series of which movies i was gonna actually see in 2019 as part of this little segment on my channel,0.04714639
we're gonna finally discuss,0.07185738
the one that a lot of people were very very positive about,0.06919859
and that is the Joseph mankiewicz film from 1950,0.07736473
also the Best Picture winner of 1950 All About Eve starring the greats Betty Davis and Baxter and Marilyn Monroe,0.037139867
so I really didn't know what this movie was about but it definitely was a movie that I had always heard of anything by name,0.055693798
and the fact that it also starred,0.060917787
the great Betty Davis,0.04252159
but one of the few things that I always thought about in regards to this film was the fact that Betty,0.06784151
Davis was the character of Eve and to my surprise she wasn't she was a character named Margo Channing,0.08414565
and Eve was played by Anne Baxter,0.061964653
so that was definitely an interesting twist for me also knowing that this was directed by Joseph mankiewicz and last year reviewing his film Cleopatra I definitely was very curious as to how I was going to feel when I watched this movie so this is the story of a young woman named Eve,0.08193466
this simple woman who is just head over heels over this Broadway actress named Margo Channing,0.39252043
and all she wants is to meet her and possibly be a part of her life and after getting an opportunity thanks to the writer of a lot of plays that Margo was a part of his wife Karen played by Celeste Holm Margo really takes a liking to Eve and asks her to be one of her personal assistants,0.09993582
and as time moves on,0.05656427
it turns out that this innocent hopeful woman with big dreams in her eyes was not the woman as she claimed to Margeaux already had her suspicions about Eve,0.25895077
pretty much from the get-go when after a few weeks had passed and she realizes that while she may be idolizing her,0.16538702
she may be a little bit more towards obsession,0.31089434
but it turns out that Eve has not only powerful feelings towards Margo in terms of her star power,0.13828109
she actually wants to use this aging Broadway star to bring her own personal career to new heights and in the world of theater,0.10039149
one of the ways to do so is to step on as many toes as you can and play people to actually make sure that you get to where you want you literally have to act offstage as well as on stage and through this process who of course gets involved,0.13268417
well the journalists get involved particularly a man named Addison DeWitt who is probably known for digging up the most dirt on celebrities as he possibly can,0.31089434
and what he discovers who this Eve is and what she's all about,0.1167487
he takes her under his personal wing and through that Eve truly feels that she's gonna get even bigger and better,0.15476067
and finally surpass Margo as the new fresh face of Broadway until she realizes that even she with the ambitions that she has can be played as well I will say with no expectations about this film whatsoever,0.10154283
this was one of the most interesting and powerful and overall excitingly dramatic films that I have seen in a long while especially through the Golden Age of Hollywood this movie with the accolades that it received at the Oscars as well as being known as one of the greatest films of all time I see it it is one of the most powerful and beautifully acted films that I have ever seen,0.06801537
I loved all of the acting in this film,0.12046974
I was so entranced by this story even with a movie over two hours long,0.092910446
the hours just flew by while I was watching it,0.08922353
one of the other things that I really appreciate about this film is especially when you take a look at today's world in film how the leftist loonies are constantly yelling about the fact that women,0.53490317
don't have powerful representation in films did you not see All About Eve,0.08523416
because the male characters in this film are barely significant compared to the powerhouses that the female actors are in this film we got an baxter and betty davis in their primes,0.07437659
and they gave us oscar-worthy performances for which they did,0.07503628
in fact win the last home playing,0.05288989
Karen Richards also playing such an incredible performance as the writers wife as well as Marilyn Monroe who has such a small role in this movie with her being on screen every minute,0.06385559
she just shines throws out great lines and even though she's only in the film I think for a general amount of maybe five minutes,0.10432674
she makes her landmark in this movie as a whole is regards to one of her better performances and I love that but without a doubt the dynamic characters the ever-changing layers of each of them is just absolutely incredible,0.060555045
I mean Betty Davis is one of the legends her famous line fasten your seat belts it's going to be a bumpy night speaks volumes in regards to what this movie is about and Baxter as Eve is such an incredible character,0.08959224
and it's not just the character evolving in the story but it's the way that she looks at the camera looks at the characters the way she looks like an innocent person in the beginning to an evil diva at the end is just absolutely incredible,0.13542886
I think that that was one of the most amazing and worthy performances that I have ever seen from any actor it just gave me goosebumps while I watched her change on screen and I just loved how at the end of the day with this character being who she was the fact that what happens to her and the end is something audience wanted to see happen,0.0886187
because you would think that Betty,0.08359921
Davis was going to be the real crazed diva of the film but it's incredible how she ended up being the victim at the end of the day to a degree because of Eve's intentions I can't recommend this movie enough even if you have never seen a black-and-white movie before even if you're not interested in any movies that were made before 1980,0.17969945
I still cannot praise all about Eve enough,0.10540653
this is one of the best films that I have ever seen in my life,0.13913211
it is a movie that I would gladly see again,0.09577385
and yes,0.05159805
it's even a movie that I would consider getting on DVD but I haven't reached that conclusion just yet,0.07438605
but it is definitely what everyone says it's supposed to be it is such an incredible film for what it is for its time,0.062183857
and it definitely pushed so many boundaries in terms of roles for women,0.12155179
I cannot praise all about Eve enough which is why I will be giving it a very strong three and a half stars out of four,0.090662636
