go to the movies don't wait til it's streaming support your local movie theaters hello,0.036240537
everybody Steph Koza here welcome to my channel check out my fancy new chair whoa,0.15154614
I'll be talking a little bit more about this chair at the end of the,0.05666367
video so stick around if you want to know about my new friend here but,0.12084258
for now it's time to talk about Toy Story 4 so I'm a huge Toy,0.05657653
Story fan who isn't a huge Toy Story fan we all grew up with it,0.047727592
we all watch the movies and they're all just so great honestly probably one of,0.03321395
my favorite Pixar movies of all time is the first Toy Story cuz it just,0.031028822
gives you those those warm bubbly you know makes you feel nice inside until they,0.23916557
made Toy Story 3 and they ripped my goddamn heart out but when they made,0.46524447
Toy Story 3 it kind of closed up the whole story nicely wrapped it up,0.052115142
with a bow and everyone was kind of like alright toy story's over they grew,0.035985105
up with Andy and he sent them off and the journey was complete and it,0.024565233
was done and then they were like hello Norman Toy Story 4 and everyone was,0.023538189
kind of like ok nobody asked for it nobody thought it was gonna happen it,0.0930093
happened here we are and I'm gonna tell you that I am really glad that,0.020685216
it happened I was kind of against this movie even though I love Toy Story,0.08335882
I was like this just feels like a cash grab like it's not really a,0.03605761
necessary film the series felt very complete to me I don't really think Toy Story,0.049425807
4 was necessary however I had a really really really good time watching Toy Story,0.029381162
4 in fact I think Toy Story 4 might be my second favorite of the,0.021425566
toy stories I do need to rewatch number 2 it's been a while but I,0.04915907
did like it better than twice Tori 3 I really did nothing will ever beat,0.049641326
the first one come on come on but Toy Story 3 for me felt very,0.06513545
I don't know it had some good moments and it came at a good time,0.055504918
in my life and it felt very final and it it had a really big,0.047692336
emotional impact on me but as a film I would say it's probably the worst,0.08778961
of all of them it just got a little of weird for me got a,0.09316296
little too extreme and very dark they took a dark turn with Toy Story 3,0.1600678
and I think they realized that in Toy Story 4 because it's much more lighthearted,0.031865623
it's very fun it's definitely the funniest of all the Toy Story movies like I,0.05206326
was laughing the whole time I had a smile on my face constantly it wasn't,0.038940515
very like heart-wrenching I mean it has it has some heart-wrenching moments it's a Pixar,0.037936088
film come on but of all the Pixar films and of all the toy stories,0.11540005
I think it's the one that made me cry the least I actually didn't cry,0.026560118
at all there was like one moment where I was like I was like almost,0.024026433
getting a little there which was a little bit surprising but honestly kind of nice,0.07424381
and refreshing because it just felt very light-hearted and it was a different kind of,0.024302484
journey and it was fun and adventurous and I didn't know where they were gonna,0.03821081
go and I just had a really good time so the story of Toy Story,0.02524505
4 is essentially after the events of Toy Story 3 and Dee grows up he,0.012364433
goes to college and he gives his box of toys away to this little girl,0.25100294
named Bonnie so bonnie is like the new Andy I guess so she has all,0.064427026
these toys they'll have Bonnie written on their shoe they live in Bonnie's room now,0.15597425
that's their whole world and it's a bit of a shock for woody because he,0.060628828
was so used to being the favorite toy and now Bonnie wants pretty much nothing,0.059686262
to do with him and he's just shoved in the closet all the time so,0.18288825
this is very much Woody's story sort of a personal growth sort of thing I,0.016670167
guess they're all kind of Woody's personal growth but this one especially is all about,0.0238016
woody and kind of figuring out himself which sounds weird when you say it like,0.03578089
that but it was very well done there's also a lot of Bo Peep in,0.026006686
this movie she is a huge character in Toy Story 4 which I was a,0.040699262
little bit iffy on at first but no Bo is not here to mess around,0.12408868
bo is the best I love Bo Peep she was one of the best characters,0.031529706
in the movie she was incredible her and woody their dynamic together was so great,0.047989007
she was so fun she was so badass never thought I'd say that about Bo,0.16655467
Peep Keanu Reeves is in this movie he plays a Canadian stuntman named Duke kaboom,0.07398106
if that's not enough to sell you on this movie I don't know what is,0.04437307
he's so great I everything that he does it's it's just so great along with,0.032992445
Duke kaboom we have some other new characters we have forky who is just hilarious,0.21104947
I loved 4q so much I can't wait till they start selling little plush toys,0.0943849
of for ki because even though I could easily make a for ki I'm gonna,0.16208929
buy a for ki we also have key and Peele who played two carnival prize,0.039847825
stuffed animals and just they can do no wrong key and Peele can do no,0.055910017
wrong pretty sure they improved every single line in this film and I'm a hundred,0.048459295
percent okay with that I always get a little bit worried when they introduce new,0.059054337
characters into Toy Story or into series like this but honestly they really carried themselves,0.024464125
if anything they were introduced really smoothly they didn't feel like they were overpowering the,0.021486763
old characters like they're very much around they added a really nice element they made,0.018571928
it feel a little more fresh and they were just really fun and funny and,0.021833988
very enjoyable to watch there are also some new toys introduced that are like the,0.031083366
villain of the story I guess no spoilers but my god they are so did,0.05929713
the stuff of nightmares the stuff of nightmares I just hmm and I think the,0.09376562
animation has like really stepped up since the last horror story movie which makes it,0.019388108
so much more visceral and you really feel like you're in these like tiny toy,0.14299054
sized environments and all of the toys really look like toys that have come to,0.15928687
life like Bo Peep has this very shiny porcelain look to her there are some,0.038669787
other characters that are like terrifyingly accurate like they truly felt like I was watching,0.028572964
a live-action showcase of these toys just like walking around and talking I guess is,0.017702533
the point of Toy Story but it was very convincing I had a smile on,0.02554172
my face honestly the entire time I was watching this film I've I remember when,0.048145328
I when the credits started rolling I was like I can't it's stuck my face,0.060308874
hurts cuz I was just smiling the whole time and literally my face hurt from,0.10079062
smiling it was really fun I would 100% buy this watch it again I think,0.025556356
if you love Toy Story or if you love pick sar or if you just,0.0711374
want to see a good movie go see Toy Story take kids go by yourself,0.14054865
I don't care it's just great like I said I need to watch the other,0.079454854
ones again because it's been a while but I think I would rank them Toy,0.08344263
