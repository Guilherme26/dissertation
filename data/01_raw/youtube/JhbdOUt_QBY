[Music] you coming back to visit yes would you like to see some words to the audience yes okay Rebecca was a 1940 dogs are not fans Rebecca was a 1940 a black-and-white motion picture starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine and I thought this was really a good film isn't really he the dogs didn't like it that's when the bump in the camera um it was a really good film they kind of kept you guessing never really knew it one point or another what exactly was going on the bottom line of this story is Joan Fontaine well I had never seen before in anything she plays this very young my innocent girl who falls in love with this Laurence Olivier's character and they have a very quick marriage and then before you know it she swept away to this crazy big castle that he lives in with a bunch of spooky people that work there and as the film kind of progresses you see that Laurence Olivier's character is haunted and tormented by the memory of his wife Rebecca under creepy and mysterious circumstances I don't went on with this one I don't really want to dig very far at all into it I'll always say is you'll see an amazing transformation in Joanne Fontaine's character and she starts to become more wary my paranoia to what's going on with Laurence Olivier was there a murder involved and so on you got to really follow the story how it unfolds I don't want to drop too many bombs or secrets or anything if you haven't seen it watch it without reading anything about it because it's a really cool mystery that if you don't know anything about the story who was who it's just really neat events of this film wonderful and again Joan Fontaine was amazing I'll prove my ignorance here I've never seen her at anything before but I absolutely loved her in this film and I actually got to see her in another film recently I'll do that review soon for Alfred Hitchcock's suspicion another really good film but uh the film is great it's in this really lush black and white the castle they live in is like uber-creepy and the I thought was really neat is the head maid woman who works there her name was Judith Anderson I'm watching her I'm like wow this is creepy old actress I know her from somewhere and then I had to do a little research she was the Vulcan High Priestess from Star Trek 3 you know remember when mr. Spock he has to get his brain back from McCoy and then they do the Vulcan ritual where you know - over over nerdy here anyhow she was the Vulcan High Priestess in that film and like I mentioned in my previous review I love it when I can kind of bridge a really old film with a semi old film from like the 1980s so it's kind of my little skip board of like I'm getting back to the 1940s to review films but I can kind of tie it in every now and then like Hume Cronyn or this Judith Anderson woman from Hades you know and that's the era I grew up in and watching films it's like wow that's really cool so she was in that what was a little bizarre I just wanted to make a mention of this is Laurence Olivier know he does a great job and what I love about this actor is he he sounds like Wesley from The Princess Bride Carrie Carrie use I'm sure if I'm saying /name right his character he just kind of has that posh English voice well if you listen to lawns Olivia in this film it reminded me a lot of Wesley from Princess Bride there's another little bridge to the 1980s and I thought that was great but what is weird is and I know they did this a lot in the older films he's clearly a lot older than Joan Fontaine but he kind of adds to the creepiness of that by making comments like you can't be too careful with children referring to his wife or don't be such a little idiot I guess I mean that's not something I would say to my wife I guess another thing I wanted to mention too was the actor George Sanders who was in this film was he was kind of the untrustworthy character he was the voice of the share come shall Sher Khan from Jungle Book I said read Shara Shere Khan and you can tell like his voice he stopped that sinister voice it's really cool but it's like not a tiger obviously it's you know a human actor and he does a really great job in the film so that's Rebecca the film is about the mystery of who is Rebecca what was her importance and why is everybody seems so haunted by her and is she actually haunting the mansion I mean there's so many great questions you can you get to resolve watching I'm gonna leave it at that and since this has been a generally goofy review to begin with I'm gonna end it with Kermit Kermit what were your thoughts about Rebecca I know you should really take the time to get to know someone first before you get married why is that correct [Music]
