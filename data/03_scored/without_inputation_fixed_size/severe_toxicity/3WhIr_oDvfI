screen but the 3d gimmick has got to go this movie is going so good,0.03580085
I've enjoying myself and then there's just one little mask or one little guy running,0.114979655
across or one little guitar just something that just just shooting directly at the screen,0.33329105
and I don't watch it in 3d but I knew oh this is for the,0.03334898
3d screen stop doing that it just takes you out of a movie when things,0.085738845
do that make a 3d gimmicky complete film or just make a film in a,0.0270171
3d environment I'm so sick of seeing scenes in movies where I know they are,0.06186607

let's make people pay $3 more for 3d if you don't need it don't do,0.042889047
it it doesn't know if it's a sequel or a reboot and I think it,0.06848531
would have helped to decide they explained generically who max is in the beginning you're,0.012753566
gonna be able to follow it even if you know nothing about the Mad Max,0.06981568
franchise it's a whole new story but yes there aren't time that's kind of referencing,0.016763292
something that happened in earlier Mad Max films but you don't really get too much,0.04594091
detail to it the biggest part of that are these flashbacks there's time when Max,0.019656843
has these just weird flashbacks where something happened in the past you can leave it,0.03860859
to interpretation if you've seen some of those earlier films you might have a better,0.03855471
understanding of what that's trying to reference so I think if they would have just,0.016233807
decided it was a sequel decided was a reboot and just gave some kind of,0.025759237
context to some of those things that would just made it absolutely perfect for the,0.021051733
