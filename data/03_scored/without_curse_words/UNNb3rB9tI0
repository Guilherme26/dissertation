one and become Wonder Woman I'm not even going to beat around the bush people,0.45440567
I've already shown you my excitement in my intro yes Wonder Woman is an awesome,0.12378135
fantastic movie it's a great superhero film it's a great origin story one of the,0.087269254
best ordered stories I've ever seen it's definitely the best movie so far this summer,0.045336254
and it's one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it,0.055386238
might even beat out Man of Steel is the best DC EU movie I'm on,0.19295071
the fence about that and I'm a huge fan of that movie so that's saying,0.07554921
a lot so all of us DC fans let's go ahead and take a collective,0.21892454
breath once we met Green Lantern ring yeah another good movie thank you thank you,0.07505653
we are crawling out of the depths of hell of 2016 finally we have another,0.35647112
great DC movie thank you seriously people if you're a DC fan it's been a,0.15070899
little bit scary lately not only was last year really disappointing for most of us,0.21869022
I know that maybe Superman and Suicide Squad have their fans but for the most,0.31848195
part a lot of us were disappointed by those movies there's no secret in that,0.09105425
and all of this news that's been coming out about all the changes all the,0.06006049
drama all these announced projects while not finishing the projects that are already in motion,0.1153174
all the craziness of the DC EU and a lot of us did not have,0.28087422
very much hope left well I'm here to tell you that if nothing else Wonder,0.1495318
Woman gives you extreme hope and extreme optimism for what's to come in the DC,0.3162329
EU learn nothing about the future let's talk about this movie that's what we're here,0.16658866
to talk about right Wonder Woman so the star of Wonder Woman that's where I,0.15134019
want to start off I was one of those people who was worried about gal,0.10889496
gadot I was really on the fence I wasn't sure if they were just picking,0.10681284
her cuz she was a pretty face or because they were trying to make a,0.21625905
star - somebody from The Fast & Furious franchise I wasn't sure about our acting,0.059638612
ability if she can be able to carry a movie and this is easily one,0.07694806
of the most anticipated and one of the most iconic female roles in Hollywood history,0.1165402
so it's very important to nail the casting well I'm here to say people I'm,0.09308677
a believer in gal gadot they nailed the casting I absolutely fell in love with,0.113863274
her over the runtime of Wonder Woman the story that we've heard for a couple,0.0898423
years now is that when gal gadot sat down for the casting session for this,0.08178304
role with zack snyder and a few WB execs they saw a spark in her,0.12790605
they saw something there and regardless everybody's hate regardless of that everybody's doubt they casted,0.19191755
her with extreme confidence and I'm telling you people you will see the spark by,0.07851953
the end of this movie you'll see it within the first 30 minutes of I'm,0.12670028
being totally honest she is charming she is electrifying especially her smile she just has,0.07845545
this beauty about her that embodies that character of Wonder Woman you see the strength,0.13639654
you see the value you see everything that that character needs to bring to the,0.07877059
screen to really convey who that character is because most of us aren't really familiar,0.056020986
with the actual core elements of that character aside from the fact that what we,0.07226727
saw in the old incarnations of the TV show she brings everything to the forefront,0.15957096
and even the side of the character that's a little bit naive because she's somebody,0.4282027
who's been on a secluded Island for so long and now she's in the world,0.10769686
of man she's in the world of all these flaws of all this death of,0.50622445
all this hate all of that naivety of her character comes through with her performance,0.5433463
really easily it's almost like it was second nature for her and it blew me,0.189695
away watching that I was like holy crap she is nailing this yep that's not,0.8060606
going to work please put the sword down Lana Dinah let me try something up,0.45562828
to you sir and another part of her performance that she really nailed is the,0.18199237
chemistry and the back-and-forth between her and her love interest Steve Trevor played by Chris,0.058357064
Pine and Chris Pine is the other strongest part of this movie they were amazing,0.05259327
together they are one of the very few couples in a superhero movie one of,0.072990984
those love interest couples that you immediately buy into and you're really emotionally invested in,0.17225134
their journey in their relationship and at the end of the day you want to,0.06696918
see more about them it's no longer about I want to see some badass action,0.3137377
I want to see what's going to go on between those two characters the millions,0.094004676
of people you talk about they will die I win anyway you mean you were,0.46231666
lying you're spy that's what I do do I know you're not lying to me,0.53490317
right now I am taking you to the front hey Chris Pine let me tell,0.06543201
you me I have not seen Chris Pine give a bad performance yet that guy,0.28942147
can do no wrong in my eyes so far I love this captain Curt a,0.12571123
lot of the independent stuff that he's done like when he popped up in smokin,0.10345662
aces one of his first roles the dude is just awesome and in this he's,0.0967927
got the same qualities that he has when he brings Captain Kirk into this new,0.1506394
incarnation he's got the charm he's got the wit he's got the humor and you,0.18474245
really understand why Princess Diana would really gravitate towards this guy Steve Trevor has kind,0.09423143
of her example for what a man is supposed to be because he has all,0.15597019
of these characteristics and all of these traits that you would want to be exemplified,0.24186493
in your ideal man he's got a lot of charm he's got a lot of,0.112448625
dignity he really wants to fight the war and World War one was to take,0.20270088
out the bad guys at all cost even if it cost him his life he,0.23321885
is ready to put all that on the line and that's awesome and that's totally,0.053420633
why they go together so well as a couple because diana has those same exact,0.08289785
characteristic traits she wants to fight regardless what happens to her because it's the right,0.1597377
thing to do and so does Steve Trevor and I'm not going to get into,0.053432535
all of them but I will say that pretty much every single side character nails,0.17791976
their performance and they really fit their piece into this story in this movie really,0.07741561
well all the Amazonians like Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright they all do really they,0.053475898
really have that badass warrior quality this island is basically the Spartans from 300 but,0.24179848
women and their badass Lucy Davis is really funny and really entertaining in the small,0.53490317
partner she has at a candy all of the little ragtag group had tags along,0.281766
with Steve Trevor into battle and the third and about halfway through the second half,0.058835596
of this movie but they're really funny they're very similar to the ragtag group that,0.15163958
Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes put together in Captain America the First Avenger not to,0.108956255
compare it to a Marvel movie chill the out DC fans small comparison if I,0.09344525
had to give one negative as far as characters and I know I usually save,0.103708826
negatives for later I'm going to get it out of the way now because it's,0.12311859
honestly the only negative I had with this entire movie is Dana Houston's character and,0.06758645
it's not necessarily his character because his character is utilized well for the story and,0.036120217
what his villainous role needs it to be can't really give too much detail there,0.088461705
was going to be spoilers but Danny Huston just really hams it up and anything,0.10109198
that he's ever done really he really hams it up he throws his cheese out,0.17939831
there he's chewing up the scenery and he really feels out of place he feels,0.10365412
like he's in a different movie all together and I didn't love what they were,0.1705946
doing with his character ultimately in the third act they do pull it out of,0.075731926
the Hat and kind of make that flaw acceptable again can't really give any spoilers,0.09339883
but you understand what I'm talking about to see the movie so it's a very,0.09783877
small negative but he's the only character run my hand just not buying this guy,0.29993168
and if I can be honest I'm getting a little bit warmth in on kind,0.24692483
of the generic stock evil German bad guy we've seen it a million times I,0.47193053
know it fits the timeframe of when this movie came out World War one but,0.14215621
I've seen it a million times I've seen it done better I was talking about,0.06766568
the story because this is the element of things that the DCE use so far,0.05518396
with the exception of Man of Steel in my opinion has really slipped up on,0.058205646
they really try to throw a bunch of things in there there's not a whole,0.09059027
lot of a cohesive flow to their stories they're just trying to really fast forward,0.0447799
to catch up to get to where the Justice League is so they can be,0.07220149
right alongside Marvel and I'm here to relieve you that Wonder Woman really takes its,0.2593615
time and tells the story that it needs to tell from the very beginning when,0.026990777
she's a little girl telling you all the way up to whenever she's adult how,0.25696012
much she's trained how much she has really had this will to be the best,0.099981494
warrior of the Amazon why she is worthy of the name of Wonder Woman why,0.15386361
she is worthy to wield the weapon of the god killer why she is so,0.5632045
determined to leave everything that she has ever known in her entire life good to,0.26949447
go and help innocent people you buy into that and that's the characters that we,0.06917107
need to have in the DCE we've seen the somber side we've seen the really,0.028619064
downside we've seen death we've seen darkness we've seen destruction it's time for some levity,0.33108845
it's time for some positivity and that's what Wonder Woman is she's here that you,0.23965856
can get behind and it actually really intrigues me and excites me even though I,0.530532
have my doubts about Justice League about seeing her interaction with Bruce Wayne about how,0.12048089
she is going to be a good foil for him how she's going to be,0.09386535
that symbol for hope and that push to make him that superhero that he can,0.06478042
be when Superman is gone because Bruce Wayne the one that we have in this,0.06981347
current universe is down he doesn't believe in hope he doesn't believe in good he,0.088242956
doesn't believe in humanity and Wonder Woman is the perfect character to show him why,0.10659906
you should believe in all those things and ultimately what I love about the story,0.053777967
of Wonder Woman and how they really tailored the story of Princess Diana in this,0.07777532
movie is that it's not your stock boards in the story where you have a,0.052348863
superhero that just discovers their powers and they're trying to build up enough strength throughout,0.04883349
90 minutes to finally take down the big bat in the third act there's elements,0.24010383
of that but that's not what the core story this movie is about it's about,0.08176209
a character who is good down to her core who is built and driven to,0.092927314
protect the innocent to protect humanity finally getting exposed to the flaws of humanity but,0.1521048
seen through those flaws and seeing the good in humanity and the reason why there,0.063866794
is ultimately hope in the end and there is a reason to protect that hope,0.054573253
even when you're watching the big climactic third act showdown between her and the main,0.11478238
villain of this movie to me I wasn't watching the hero triumphing over a villain,0.16944455
I was watching a hero triumphing over her doubt of humanity and I was incredible,0.21659137
how they were able to blend those two things simultaneously in the same story and,0.043290257
while I'm talking about the story there's one detailed at the very beginning of the,0.03123506
movie in the very end of the movie that I need to comment on because,0.07630456
I was really happy with the way that they did this the way that they,0.03373851
incorporate the story of this movie into the overall picture of the DC EU was,0.09033928
masterfully done because it's done really tastefully it really enhances the story and really cares,0.08985277
to the story of who Princess Diana is and the journey she goes on in,0.05256436
this movie it's actually kind of a really emotional moment whenever it all comes together,0.10597794
towards the end but it doesn't distract from the fact that this is a Wonder,0.03290546
Woman movie there's not Batman cameos there's not the flash cameos nobody's flying by in,0.2130716
a red cape none of that's going on just a small little detail that lets,0.15500766
you know just in case you weren't aware this is in the DC EU along,0.1068634
with that maybe Superman and Man of Steel and all that but it doesn't distract,0.054593194
the movie at all it actually adds to it so I thought that was a,0.074794576
small detail that they nailed in this and a lot of the credit I got,0.1477802
to give to the director patty Jenkins I mean we were all really optimistic from,0.07963208
the time that this woman got signed on the director of monster is directing your,0.54724413
Wonder Woman movie that's like a dream come true and luckily they utilized her they,0.17423566
let her make the movie she wanted to make and we have the Wonder Woman,0.15992314
awesome badass masterpiece movie that we have in front of us now because they trusted,0.41956455
their director and I hope that this is a sign of things to come for,0.06609095
the DC EU because they have a lot of great directors and a lot of,0.054266237
great writers on their billing currently to do some of the movies that are already,0.08984661
planned and as long as they let them make their movie the way that they,0.085104465
let patty Jenkins make her Wonder Woman movie we're all going to be just fine,0.2107877
but seriously patty Jenkins did an incredible job I love the way that she really,0.11786862
structured and divided up this movie into three separate acts because each act has its,0.070159055
own flavor its own tone and they somehow all blend together to make one really,0.07232679
cohesive story that's not easy to do like your first act is definitely your sword,0.1954659
and sandals movie you're introduced to the island of that mascara you get introduced to,0.1289215
the world of the Amazonian you've got Diana and from birth all the way up,0.09928967
to an adult you get all of that great stuff the second act is more,0.18853079
of a period piece you get a little bit of spy movie flavor in there,0.1750224
as where a lot of the budding romance and the relationship between Chris Pine and,0.032543797
gal gadot really starts to grow back or maybe not and then your third act,0.3203376
is your war movie that's when World War warm that whole setting really starts to,0.09695304
take shape you get Princess Diana sharing all of her clothes to deal that awesome,0.29718682
armor that looks unbelievable on gal gadot by the way walking into a hail of,0.1319825
gunfire showing what she is made of what she is here to do what she,0.2412679
is here represent and from then on it is just balls to the wall great,0.53490317
action scenes great set pieces a lot of amazing camerawork especially when they're doing like,0.09406034
horseback riding and everything the way that they shoot between the trees and the way,0.44274053
that Patti Jing has really framed a lot of shots whenever they're doing fight scenes,0.3530342
and you see a lot of these slow-mo flips around and there's no point in,0.3677141
the action scenes when you can't tell what's going on it's all really cohesive it's,0.067704484
all really focused all of that came together awesome all of the action in this,0.06087981
movie is awesome it's all directed great gal gadot is really physical you can tell,0.09526319
if she really trained for this role and she was not taking the role of,0.07724397
Wonder Woman lightly she wasn't taken as a paycheck she is here to bring you,0.12636144
the iconic female superhero that Wonder Woman is and the last thing that I really,0.15215662
need to nail down in this review is that the score and this movie is,0.119662575
incredible now I am NOT a guy that talks about scores very often I don't,0.10156455
know very many composers name I don't really have soundtracks or any kind of scores,0.0993176
on my iPod that I'm listening to and it's honestly a weakness whenever you look,0.18890707
at me in trivia games Sean but from the opening frame of this movie the,0.06682873
score literally grabbed ahold of me it's one of the greatest superhero scores that I've,0.07433475
ever heard in my life and I might even download it to listen to it,0.15274885
some more because it is that good the store itself is telling the story alongside,0.05559857
the movie you can almost close your eyes and just listen to the score for,0.1340135
two hours and the music is going to take you to the same journey that,0.18410027
patty Jenkins Chris Pine and gal gadot take you in while watching these characters it's,0.13990742
incredible so wrap all this up guys Wonder Woman is an incredible superhero movie it's,0.16309948
a great origin story it's an incredible piece of the DC EU that we so,0.06949053
badly needed and it just gives you a huge symbol of hope and optimism for,0.08501731
what's to come out of the DC EU gal gadot absolutely nailed it I fell,0.24055539
in love with her over the runtime of this movie as I'm saying it again,0.23680177
I fell in love with her Chris Pine was incredible patty Jenkins was incredible the,0.11495119
score was incredible only one tiny little weakness with one of the villain characters that's,0.10323008
easily glossed over because the way that they utilized that character this movie was just,0.08337402
a wild ride it was an absolute joy to watch I think just about everybody,0.15166722
is going to be pleased by this I can't think of anybody who will watch,0.10812331
this story see these characters and seek out without performance especially and walk away turning,0.09230292
their nose up I think this is one of the best comic book movies to,0.26176697
ever be made it's definitely one of the best DC movies to be made since,0.058084525
the Dark Knight and it's absolutely worth your attention worth your time and worth your,0.16911449
money so go see it in theaters and then when it comes out on home,0.08156957
video go out and buy it so what did you guys think of Wonder Woman,0.22387499
is this the best DC EU movie that we have gotten I'm still on the,0.08038246
fence about that or Man of Steel keep an eye out for my ranking video,0.1705074
I'll be having this weekend where I finally have to make that decision I need,0.05001912
to watch Mayo steel one more time but it's definitely going to be a tight,0.08831717
race is this your favorite DC movie that's coming out since the Dark Knight do,0.107157916

movie brought or do you feel like the DC still has room to grow and,0.11141842
