all of the buzz people have been talking about let's find out now before I,0.15183526
get into my thoughts let me know what you guys thought of Roma in the,0.14222312
comments down below are you a big fan of Alfonzo her own and did you,0.25050718
really kind of like this foreign film aspect now let's get into some of the,0.077933475
good things this film did first things first I'm gonna say that Roma might not,0.10014154
be for everyone one if you're not into black and white movies not gonna work,0.327963
if you're not into reading subtitles or it being in a foreign language probably not,0.07705384
gonna work and this is a very much art houseing personalized story so if you're,0.05100146
not into that Roma's probably not gonna be there for you anyways getting the into,0.123702444
Roma this is a very beautifully shot film I mean obviously it was a bold,0.25100148
choice or the directors choice to have this all in black and white hold on,0.12399951
a sec but you know a lot of the shots that he has in this,0.17204677
film are really enhanced by that black and white color choice from the opening credits,0.031252407
of having the skyline reflected on to like the wet tile of the floor or,0.3056664
the closing kind of sequence of having this wondrous beautiful sunset in the background when,0.23074141
they're on the beach through and through I personally think that Roma is one of,0.07209089
the most beautiful films of 2018 and it's not just the beautiful shots but there's,0.15134908
also these really good or really satisfying tracking shots following Clio as she kind of,0.33582553
her and her friend go down a street and it follows them or when she's,0.19085173
in the house of Sofia and she's going through and turning off all the lights,0.07866474
before bedtime it really the camera just kind of follows her throughout this sequence and,0.07091615
it's really satisfying also korone did this thing maybe he wants twice maybe three times,0.07057135
in this movie where the main character or the characters that we are focused we're,0.03554325
in the foreground and it's a very emotional time in those characters lives but in,0.052770276
the background there's kind of like light-hearted fun happiness going on so it's really this,0.051682968
dual like emotional aspect that's really almost like it's satisfying but also cruel at the,0.116462864
same time it was a little off-putting the first time I saw but again korone,0.102822386
knew what he was doing in this film and it really ties everything together as,0.07357062
for the story in Roma it really has this kind of main storyline it's very,0.04588208
emotional and it follows Cleo as she you know she's this made for this family,0.09525286
of a wife her husband and four kids but then as the story kind of,0.09809702
goes on you get more in depth into her story you find out that she,0.10655832
gets pregnant the guy isn't really the best guy she has to go through all,0.23043457
of this emotional stuff by herself and it's just it's a really heartbreaking story I,0.069673955
will say that right away it kind of felt like a cliched story where you,0.08100213
know this one person gets pregnant the guy leaves her but then it does take,0.13244377
these twists and turns that again are very emotional very painful and it's just it's,0.20327157
not something that you're really used to and next to the main storyline of Cleo,0.16580357
and what she has to really deal with there's also kind of this subtle it,0.07431373
kind of takes more screen time towards the end story between Sophia her husband and,0.096994326
the four kids and the family in general basically Sophia's husband is this doctor he,0.07650872
obviously it's revealed that he's kind of cheating he has a mistress so that's really,0.3594427
taking a toll on Sophia and the kids and it shows how she has to,0.089074805
really struggle between keeping her life together or keeping her emotions in check while also,0.12878488
you know kind of putting on this facade for the kids before she can officially,0.22555599
tell them it's these dual stories that really keep things interesting and makes the story,0.057460677
kind of flow on and again Sophia and Cleo actually kind of come together at,0.16292758
the end and they're there for each other through honestly some of the emotional stuff,0.06953204
that they've ever had to deal with in their lives however I did not think,0.14902863
that Roma was as perfect as some critics are saying obviously it takes on this,0.11330044
foreign film aspect there's subtitles there's black-and-white you got to get over that stuff but,0.0563229
my lord this movie is slow and I mean solo it's definitely more of an,0.14612392
arthouse he kind of needs type movie and there's a lot of shots or sequences,0.15885483
that are supposed to hang on you as a viewer and it does hang on,0.53118026
you but sometimes it's focusing or looking at certain things for much too long and,0.07003909
the shot just it just carries on also like I said that it's you know,0.16647327
this art house the indie type of film there were some scenes that just felt,0.07167017
out of place I honestly I didn't even you know what just lets roll one,0.15390383
of them over all Roma is this uniquely shot in emotional driven film with some,0.2403203
beautiful shots korone really toying with our emotions and this emotional twofold story that floats,0.24250695
throughout but with it unfolding very much slowly and some art housey type material I'd,0.058041625
recommend checking out Roma if you have the chance I mean pretty much everyone has,0.14167011
Netflix so you know turn it on give it a try in closing I'm gonna,0.14990586
give Roma four point four out of five emotional black-and-white shots so what did you,0.18684188
