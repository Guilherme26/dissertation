logan is directed by james mangold and is the final portrayal of wolverine by hugh,0.07282457
jackman or so he says james mangold last directed the wolverine which i thought was,0.18858887
pretty good up until the third act which got really silly but up until then,0.48972017
I was like yes this is what I need and if you watch the extended,0.09085708
cut of the Wolverine it's even better so I was happy that James Mangold was,0.11449375
returning to direct this final portrayal of such an iconic character I'm going to go,0.0793116
very light on the plot synopsis because I got to see this very early at,0.057298437
a press screening and basically Logan has to cart this girl around he's not entirely,0.19251889
sure what her backstory is and as he learns more about it he learns more,0.07843203
about himself as well so as Wolverine is slicing and dicing various bad guys he,0.32830274
and Professor X have to try to protect this girl who may not really need,0.379882
that much protection because she's got some tricks up her sleeve this is also the,0.10498837
first movie featuring Wolverine to be rated R this film is brutal oh my god,0.15124935
there is so much blood and limbs I loved it they really didn't hold anything,0.15134808
back Wolverine goes absolutely berserk on people in this movie he's chopping off limbs he's,0.63507164
impaling people and it's not squeaky clean there's blood everywhere and my god it's nlgger,0.6354758
great from an action standpoint this is probably my favorite in the x-men universe not,0.10043704
just because of the fact that it doesn't hold back but because Wolverine is old,0.09975912
he's tired he's broken down he's beaten physically and emotionally he's doing back-alley drug deals,0.40326592
to get pills for Professor X I mean this guy is just a complete shadow,0.5154597
of what he used to be so when someone comes around challenging him it's amazing,0.082486376
to see that old Wolverine come out that insane Weapon X that we've come to,0.30141166
love in other movies really come to fruition again when just the right buttons are,0.06957648
pushed and this is something that I expected going in knowing that it's rated R,0.07900255
knowing that rating says strong brutal bloody violence that's what I want to see and,0.42870662
we do get that but from an emotional standpoint I was very satisfied with Logan,0.051232725
in regards to the fact this is more in line with what Christopher Nolan did,0.08015933
with Batman less of what we've seen with the Avengers Marvel movies this is a,0.09901339
very somber serious drama that contains exciting bursts of action throughout this isn't a movie,0.06495124
where our heroes walk around sad and depressed the entire time it's not completely devoid,0.07136539
of humor it has a lot of fun in there as well and some good,0.055238064
jokes but it is kept at a very gracious minimum this is a dark violent,0.36594588
movie in which very little hope remains for these characters they're at about 99.9% done,0.05882555
with hope there is a very tiny little shred of it remaining in these characters,0.31089434
eyes it is so great and riveting to see these characters we've grown to love,0.059362207
put in a place that's so dark and so small and almost completely forgotten about,0.087394066
that you just want to see them climb out of the hole they're in and,0.354728
watching these characters especially the young girl in the film grow to appreciate one another,0.109426565
and learn to help each other again and be heroes again it was fantastic this,0.0520015
movie makes the curious choice of having the x-men comics physically exist in this world,0.14079864
and they're viewed as these fictional stories that people wrote based off of the real,0.06962982
heroes so Wolverine picks up an x-men comic and looks through a Yaz's bullsháá and,0.4835164
throws it away you know that's actually really smart I love that because it takes,0.15456703
place in the future of the timeline established in Days of Future past so you,0.066563144
can do a lot with what took place in between those two films and apparently,0.13547583
a lot of people are very happy with the x-men and view them as heroes,0.10852102
and so there's comic books that exist in this world about them and it's really,0.15790671
actually a very smart and fresh idea and I like the fact that include that,0.05835351
in there I would say the first act and the third act of this movie,0.06575325
are the best those two acts are extremely riveting very fast paced intense they almost,0.0863673
feel like westerns there's a definite Western sense to this movie that James Mangold is,0.096223414
going for even right down to a scene where the characters are watching the movie,0.06386185
Shane on TV but the second act turns into a roadtrip movie of sorts and,0.1084382
it meanders a little bit nothing from a dramatic standpoint that's very interesting is happening,0.15595095
there also wasn't a lot of action for that period that act was really taken,0.09149045
to make the little girl and Wolverine grow as characters and it wasn't quite as,0.28908163
interesting as I think it could have been the film sometimes chooses to focus on,0.0407398
characters that are nowhere near as compelling as the ones that we want it to,0.067784786
focus on it sometimes takes way too much time with other characters that I feel,0.052090697
don't really have that much weight or impact to this movie the film also makes,0.081463516
another interesting choice for the characters that to my knowledge has no basis in the,0.06347908
comics I believe the writers have completely invented this character for some it might be,0.040206727
a distraction gratefully it's handled pretty well it's actually kind of scary what they do,0.15845317
with a specific character in this film that to my knowledge as I said is,0.05195721
completely invented by the screenwriters his addition in this movie is fairly miniscule but some,0.10021801
are probably going to be annoyed by it because it's sort of invented again I've,0.08244496
read a lot of x-men comics but I haven't read all of them so if,0.15434863
I'm wrong I'm wrong but I think he mostly worked for this movie and I,0.076805584
think that if fans can accept the fact that not everything in these movies has,0.075938135
to be perfectly like the comics and that these are adaptations of the comics and,0.09924869
I think most men will be ok with it especially since it's brutal and kind,0.28695744
of terrifying actually now of course no spoilers but as for the way everything wraps,0.10218279
up in this movie I found it to be pretty satisfying I did want just,0.0846615
a little bit more emotionally just maybe a couple more little punches to my gut,0.33211455
but for the most part everything ended in a way that I think is very,0.066639125
satisfactory for longtime fans and for myself in particular it's not a perfect movie sometimes,0.13175397
the tone and the pacing of it all gets a little jumbled but as a,0.099405676
final portrayal of this character Hugh Jackman was just so nlgger badass he knocked it,0.53939706
out of the park once again for one last time seeing our beloved will be,0.07035871
so broken and learning about his past some things he maybe didn't even want to,0.07468343
know about it was kind of heart-wrenching and he did a fantastic job Patrick Stewart,0.075447954
is also amazing in this movie I love the little girl as well I thought,0.15309708
she was very good James Mangold's vision for this movie is very beautiful I think,0.11403174
it's a very good-looking movie very well edited I liked Logan quite a bit I'm,0.12347272
going to give it an A - guys if you can't tell right now I,0.18169327
am sick as hell I have had the worst cold add in years and I,0.4032654
drove myself to the theater tonight I have not yet seen the Great Wall or,0.06268465
a cure for wellness or anything this weekend I just was like go see Logan,0.07813161
you have to see it you got to get this video up I'll try to,0.10925175
get the Great Wall up as soon as I can sorry I just might throw,0.449464
up my so I've had like this flu I was having weird like fever dreams,0.18218245
the other night it was crazy anyway guys thank you very much for watching and,0.4032217
