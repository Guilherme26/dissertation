Wow I I knew that Logan was going to be brutal I hoped it would,0.04756861
be brutal but I was not prepared that the deepest cuts would be emotional I,0.040713895
mean this is a tour-de-force they swear a lot in the movie I mean it's,0.05900046
earned it fits but boy there's a lot of swearing in here so I say,0.04423405
with the utmost respect this is a tour de force for Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart,0.046420507
and James Mangold and congrats non-callable greeters you finally get to meet Wolverine this is,0.025815113
the first time that I've seen a comic book character accurately portrayed on the silver,0.026799584
screen as they are in the comics like wasting special things done with comic book,0.049199644
characters on the big screen before but never have I watched a movie and said,0.024917115
I feel like I'm reading one of those comic book stories I had that feeling,0.025045495
a little bit with the first Avengers but that's a whole different type of story,0.027088273
Wolverine comics tend to be a little bit a little more drama a little more,0.14350937
storing them you know it's not like 90% fighting so to have that transposed to,0.079460844
the big screen is incredibly satisfying and also for all of you who like to,0.079806075
still write up comic books as well as the funny pages right or like a,0.08141914
lesser form of storytelling well I'm telling you this is what this is what we're,0.04114427
reading you're getting it right here and this is from the very first scene the,0.016823824
first scene I felt like again I was reading a Wolverine story it was perfect,0.041226752
on every level and that of course includes the fighting it was a thrill to,0.027950352
finally see a Wolverine fight done correctly brought to life on the big screen it,0.05075617
was just as magical as I'd hoped it would be I was like that's exactly,0.028626177
how he would do it and it wasn't overly gory I mean it was just,0.039070893
it was just right you know like they didn't err on the side of caution,0.021852612
they didn't go for overt overkill uh but it looked like it hurt it looks,0.052322682
like I hurt everyone involved and I loved it and we're not just talking fight,0.14988916
choreography and visual effects here we're talking camerawork and also the score I thought the,0.01579279
music was used and ibly well here and they say Johnny Cash just for the,0.008933417
credits so the score here it's not just cheats with you know songs the score,0.052794296
is incredibly well done but you know what else is good no scripts I mean,0.051835764
it would have to be to be telling a Wolverine story the way I just,0.019114053
said but I think we have to talk about the script in its own special,0.017725814
section because that's very rare for comic book movies still unfortunately and had amazing one-liners,0.027847249
and had a did a great job exploring relationships but it also did a great,0.024220668
job and what it chose to leave unsaid both emotionally and in terms of story,0.03584475
points it's very sophisticated you know it asks you to fill in a lot of,0.030216632
the blanks but without directly asking you to do so you had to really pay,0.025323542
close attention I think and if that's one way that this movie will benefit from,0.0239965
repeat viewings I don't know how many recent doings it's going to get we're going,0.029286705
to talk about some of its very few flaws at the end of the reveal,0.026991822
this is no spoiler so so don't worry about that but I think on the,0.020611381
screenwriting front it's definitely worth at least one more visit to try and pick up,0.03328047
on some of the things that work I think even by the end of the,0.030854544
movie still not clarified which I which I thought was great I really liked that,0.034544982
choice I mean they need to be clarified you got the overall idea and you've,0.10777372
got the same idea that the characters were getting I think I was part of,0.015278603
the experience I think the magic ingredients in the script might be James Mangold because,0.015658423
the other team screenwriters is all due respect to them I mean they did contribute,0.055790283
to the script so yeh Ovid Scott Frank worked on the last Wolverine and Michael,0.015697004
Greene helped out with Green Lantern so I'm thinking that mangle is the one that,0.021349734
may use the special sauce here and it goes to show how important it is,0.014913417
who you hire to write these movies we've talked so much about the directors and,0.02742286
I think that the writer should be just as important to conversation not just amongst,0.07567129
us I mean of course we would take it seriously or I hope that the,0.03954051
studio executives would realise that as well particularly when you get results like this the,0.036332995
movie also to my surprise reminded me of a terminator movie t2 in particular but,0.05532133
not like hey you ripped off terminator but like hey here are two great movies,0.10356577
that have a surprising amount of overlap that had not I had not seen before,0.028403342
and this movie makes it very clear it also makes you miss Terminator movies I'd,0.024838623
also like to point out on that note that there are a lot of surprises,0.04523382
in store for you when you see this movie this year you know last year,0.027267873
was the year like did you show too much in the trailer and people have,0.023208257
been worried about this this year so far like cure for wellness they had like,0.021291863
a ton of stuff they didn't show here I was amazed at how much had,0.025299596
not been revealed about the movie and I was very very impressed with that so,0.023842178
beware spoilers and they're just really it's really great because some of you might be,0.08178167
like how is it like a tournament you'll see all right natural performance is Hugh,0.02656544
Jackman this has been his signature role for 17 years I can't believe he's been,0.017062625
playing this character for 17 years and with this movie he walks that down forever,0.029375175
this is forever his I was just it was so impressive he also made me,0.031731922
cry this movie made me cry a lot you'll want to have like tissues coming,0.063533686
out of your fists like Wolverines claws like like we're not talking like oh I'm,0.43133184
teary-eyed we're talking like a single tear down my cheek you know bottom line you,0.41477147
know I had - a 3d glasses I had my regular glasses on we watch,0.0643645
this in 2d and it was great just a single tear I was like oh,0.060170516
my god and then Patrick Stewart also made me cry the the subtleties and the,0.055737067
rawness of both their performances is something to behold indeed and there isn't a single,0.01854665
ounce of vanity in either of their performances and a lot of love the characters,0.032859407
they're playing this leader this is the antithesis of the paycheck gig and it was,0.025292277
so fabulous to be able to experience that that Boyd Holbrook he makes one heck,0.1512601
of an introduction for himself his first his first scene is one of the best,0.038041852
conversations in a movie that is full of great conversations like this is one of,0.026235508
those movies you know we talk about people fast forward from action sequence to action,0.029629275
sequence or this is a movie where you will stop for some of the conversations,0.0589366
as well and want to see them play out again they're just that good it's,0.038176887
so nice to have a good script it's such it was so wonderful but if,0.021447517
the film goes on the movie needs Boyd Holbrook's character less and less so he,0.01961294
kind of stayed since the background little bit that's for Daphne keen she knocks her,0.06963209
fighting scenes out of the park and she has a hundred and ten percent believable,0.03214899
as a baby Wolverine however she doesn't have Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's likability factor,0.087230854
part of that is built into the story and you'll see that when you watch,0.013706109
the movie but part of it unfortunately is just the actress and maybe what the,0.06060422
child is hard like what do we go out for do we go for someone,0.2886954
who can sell the fight scenes or we go for someone can sell the emotional,0.051430006
things and of course you go with the fight scene that's the most important in,0.03767334
a movie like this and even if she was a bit a little bit more,0.22572795
personable I think that the script doesn't give her a moment to call her own,0.028259663
outside of the action sequences anyway so I think that also hurts your character but,0.027328406
I felt I never really got to know x-23 but then also in addition to,0.01907281
that as far as flaws go Moises moves perfect absolutely perfect but the third act,0.07186112
I actually kind of resent the movie a little bit for the third act and,0.07949343
we'll talk about that in a spoiler review closer to when the film is released,0.014648009
because I don't want to give away spoilers but I'm talking I I resent the,0.026808232
choices that were made in the third act both story wise and also in terms,0.011853573
of message and I think speaking of message one problem this film is going to,0.040390614
potentially have is it's going to come across as being political now I don't know,0.034964047
if that's intentional or if it ended up being amped up more than they intended,0.023749717
by the way things have developed particularly here in the United States but I know,0.023844173
that there are certain things that are a problem there are like I'm a real,0.026168324
hot-button sensitive issue across the globe and this movie kind of taps into that let,0.06098071
me just say if the Budweiser Super Bowl commercial annoy you this movie is going,0.09308247
to make your head explode and so I feel kind of bad that because of,0.3781871
the third act choices that this movie makes in a number of areas it might,0.020019367
hurt the film's commercial prospects so I won't be curious to see how it does,0.043079287
at the box-office long-term you know it's going to be huge the first weekend I,0.020742422
do worry about repeat business word of mouth a little bit because of that particularly,0.0839781
in red states let's say all right all right well so finally this for most,0.023116462
part and this is the only thing that keeps us from being them being equal,0.037251614
but this is very very very close to the dark night in terms of quality,0.03435474
when it comes to comic book movies and while Marvel Studios formula has been incredibly,0.10395623
successful they should be a little bit nervous because now Fox is two for two,0.05623396
because what Fox are starting to do with their Marvel movies is awe-inspiring and it's,0.0795839
the kind of work that we hope to see with the genre the comic book,0.065587774
genre post Nolan but they didn't materialize and now it is materializing over at Fox,0.046443786
which is crazy when you think about it considering what they've had to go through,0.043763764
but maybe that was part of the process but they have come out on on,0.025555026
the other end making movies of the quality just shy just shy of the quality,0.058187604
of the Dark Knight I'm not impressed so we will be discussing this for sure,0.024595166
more as you know in much more details to get closer to the film's release,0.0075471736
but I'm so happy to tell you you should definitely buy your Logan tickets and,0.018540664
bring tissues alright alright your thought your thoughts down below if you have by any,0.1625283
chance seen the film do not spoil it for anyone uh and you can check,0.014348676
