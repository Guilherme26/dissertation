see the fact that this whoa is that the first time i'm hearing this with headphones so that noise just zipped through my left ear that was insane that was wild i don't know like that was that that spooked me a little bit yo yo yo what's up everybody welcome back to another movie reaction and commentary today we're going to be re-watching arrival now i'm really excited to kind of jump into this one because it's been a minute since i've watched this to the point where i kind of forget the main theme of this i know it has something to do with aliens and like communication but i know there's like a twist at the end that you know i think implements time travel or something like that um but yeah i just remember being like really blown away primarily due to the cinematography as well as just the direction that this movie decided to take and i'm really excited to kind of rewatch that and provide some filmmaking aspects to things uh that can hopefully bring value to you guys and also maybe clarify some things that maybe you hadn't realized the first time or second time or however many times you've watched this film so i'm really excited to kind of do this this is also starring amy adams forest whitaker and jeremy renner um and we got the man the myth the legend dennis the villain i'm not gonna call that i'm not gonna say his last day because i know i'm a butch it up even though i know how to say it i'm just not gonna even attempt it because knowing me i might butcher it but on here we're gonna call him dennis the villain because he's villainous with the camera and this dude knows how to direct movies he's just been killing it ever since i you know watched prisoners on here i'm really excited for i believe he's doing dune as well too um blade runner 2049 was just incredible yeah i mean he's he's on a roll in terms of just directing these incredible really deeply layered films that you know encompass not only filmmaking and why filmmaking is great but also it does justice to the overall story that he's presenting to the audience in general and i think that's a perfect balance so i'm excited to kind of jump into this when i kind of re-watch this and from the eyes of a filmmaker now and just really just like you know be able to uh sit down and hopefully bring some education to things that maybe you haven't known about like always guys the best way to support the channel is through patreon but i get it now everybody does that you can still leave a like comment and subscribe and it will definitely help out the channel just as much as well as let's say for instance you don't have a sign in account you can just sit back relax and the best thing you can do for yourself and for me is to just enjoy your time as we watch or i should say re-watch arrival again guys if you want to watch the full length definitely check out the patreon link below there you can sync up your copy of the film with mine and enjoy all the commentary and laughs and whatever the heck is in the freaking video that i don't put on youtube you guys already know the drill yeah this scene hurts a lot because of knowing the scene definitely holds new meaning now if i can remember correctly on uh what exactly happened at the end of this film but also this is a kick-ass soundtrack i've heard it multiple times too bad i can't play it for y'all but just know it's like the it's like the sad soundtrack you guys know what it is yeah again guys you know i would i mean this is definitely sci-fi i would say in its own way you know storytelling is there are days that define yours millions and trillions of ways to formulate a story so i would consider this sci-fi but very psychological i love the the tackle of you know inner questions and things or themes that you know really depend on the independent and how they affect the outside world basically imagine this film being like imploding in on itself and then exploding hold on i'm learning that more objects like this have landed ah it's so great that they're keeping this frame on her face as the information is being told to us without showing us what it is like that's so well done that's so well done builds a lot of questions and it also builds this narrative it's really cool i really relate to dennis and his way of you know storytelling because it's some of the things that i would do the only ones to have one of these in our backyard if this is some sort of peaceful first contact another thing too that i really appreciate is the flow of information within this film i'm noticing it now but just the audio uh that's outside of like you know our main source here you know the dialogue is being almost transitional it's like a transition phase to every scene so even though the scenes are changing the flow of information still keeps the same pace which allows us to you know really piece together what the director or you know the filmmaker wants us to know lady ain't nobody showing up the class like there's aliens coming to earth no one is showing up to class you're always going to have teachers like that it's the weirdest thing to me go home like can you imagine someone coming into your your your workspace and saying can you translate that and then proceed to like let you hear that it's like i i don't even know where to start with that i don't even know what to even begin with that tonight as russia and china join talks at the united nations meanwhile financial markets across the world are in crisis as the dow jones industrial outlet if any of you notice too there's a lot of blue like like the color blue just literally radiating the film itself why i'm not too sure but i would love to understand why blue seems to dominate a lot of the shot selections get here are they capable faster than my travel i think you might have a i love how realistic this film is man this film is just so damn realistic in its approach and how they decided to tackle this i would have loved to seen like the conversation of tackling this film as realistic as possible i wonder if they talked with anybody god what the hell man that shot is crazy dude with this music in the background just damn it's so good it's so good i love it like this is my speed to a t that sense of scale is wild wild what a crazy cool way to just introduce that oval-shaped spaceship [Music] man i really love that it's just super cloudy which is like the greatest thing at least for like uh a cinematographer [Laughter] like just the the atmosphere the vibe that's weight down in a lot of these shots because of just how it looks like i'm telling you guys like the look of your film can really affect the story of your film every aspect of filmmaking is important and that's why i tell you the best thing that you could do as a filmmaker or anybody that's dealing with any piece of art is to know the vibe that you want to cast not only for your audience but for yourself yeah bro that sense of scale is just ridiculous it's one of the reasons why i'm also really excited for dune too because that sense of scale man like the scale is what is one of my favorites within this film like just looking up and seeing this fortress of an identified floating object that's not from our galaxy really that is wild that's crazy that's that's insane that's insane dawg that sound is wild i don't even know how they did that doctor [ __ ] [ __ ] dude like what they literally look like their hands are doing this bro like that's like dude that's so cool like that's incredible man shout out to everyone who worked on this film this is just such a surreal moment [Music] i don't know about y'all i get a marine biologist in the building like this this sounds like wells communicating with each other or some deep-sea creature communicating with each other they're using like vibrations like that's wild set their compound ablaze their website claims the arrival of the aliens set in motion of prophecy the 12 sets and it's not even just a race against time for the aliens it's a race against time for like the people of the world because we're just freaking out you know like everybody's freaking out because they don't know what the heck is happening so the reason why i'm assuming that the military is like hey we need to do this fast it's because everything is gonna you know everything is just gonna fall apart bro that is so cool man that is so cool man help me understand okay um i gotta say i'm so frustrated with forrest whitaker's forrest whitaker's like questions but like i'm happy he is questioning it so that way i can learn too but he is frustrating [Music] my thing is like you can't see the top of their bodies like it's it's forever in mystery you don't exactly know how big they are or what the finished product of their body even looks like they're like weird octopus that are blind it's really strange and i love it that is wild man i love that that's so cool bro that's so cool damn i love sci-fi man it's so dope see the fact that this whoa it's like the first time i'm hearing this with headphones so that noise just zipped through my left ear that was insane that was wild i don't know like that was that that spooked me a little bit unlike all written humanly it's like teaching an infant the dictionary through painting that's literally what it is i only say infant because you know they don't know the language so imagine trying to teach an infant the human dictionary through like i don't know pollock paintings you would have to know each word you wanted to use as well as how much space that it would occupy such a brilliant a brilliant way to tell that like that's just so good what's this word yeah i if you were to tell me that there would be a correlation between a grieving mother who's lost their child and extraterrestrial aliens i'd be like okay it's just it's incredible that it makes sense off her weapon wow oh god god that's ah yeah that would definitely bring some uh some tension action prevails there's no evidence of that sure there is let's grab a history book the british with india the germans with rwanda yeah but that's human like that's human that's so weird to bring up history when you're dealing with aliens especially when you don't know what they are and their communication is vastly different that's the one thing man that it frustrated me when i first watched this is people's just like oh yeah well history it's only been humans it's human history like what and there would be idiots like this there will be idiots like this just stupid dumb not know how to do their job idiots oh god that's so annoying oh snap i think it's tapping it because it's like yo there is a bomb in our ship brett go get that thing [Music] it's like hey so like i know all over time dimension there's a bomb in our ship you should get that damn i think this was when it clicked for me when i first watched it i was like oh yeah these dudes are like other dimension like they know how to like what with uh ian said being able to know a beginning and middle a beginning and ending of a sentence is basically that but just with time wow dude i can't believe i don't remember this part what the heck that's crazy yo said the aliens have 24 hours to leave chinese territory or face destruction and he urged all other world i hate how like realistic how realistic this would be like it's so stupid it's so stupid man i'm just like why don't you just let people do their jobs i don't know but like whatever stop focusing on the ones look at the zeros how much of this is data how much of it is negative space yup and this is where the dimensions come in man they're in a whole different dimension [Music] speaking in 5d basically they are speaking in five-dimensional i don't even know what that looked like so i don't even know what how that even would i can't even fathom that what trade it's a non-zero sum game non-zero sum game oh my god everything is freaking connected bro what yo it's ah dude time and sci-fi there's so much out there that's just so interesting to me i'm so happy this film exists i've never seen anything like it i'm not sure if it was like originally a book or whatnot but so interesting [Music] yeah at that point it's it's destined to be her like you just know that it's destined to be heard this is so bizarre man i love it god that is just so awesome man just so many questions are just in my brain right now so many visually how do you capture something like this you know like man the visuals in this are just beyond [Music] anything yo yo that's that's that's i can't fathom that how do they design that oh that's so intriguing [Music] this is so cool man this is so dope [Laughter] oh yeah i mean i'll be i'd be crapping my pants tremendously though who's this child yep and then that's where it clicks she didn't even have a kid yet [Music] right imagine imagine trying to put that and wrap it around your stupid three-dimensional human mind like how do how does one do that how does one do that it's my fault i told him something that he wasn't ready to hear oh it clicks now i unders i i'm getting where i left off from when i first watched this yeah got you that's why he left it's ian by the way she basically was like hey dude um our tartar is gonna die from cancer and your poetry and all the other amazing things that you share with the world i am unstoppable oh that's crazy like i literally was telling y'all someone came up to me and said yeah this film is about you know a person you know losing their daughter and then aliens and then connected would you guys have thought that this would be one of the ways it reads the same forward from beginning and end all right that's no it's clicking i don't know i think i clicked this when i first watched this but i can't remember me like getting it but i'm like re-clicking things and i'm like damn it's basically like trying to it's like you realizing you've already lived and picking up the pieces from where you've left off i'm not sure if that's like a good way to remember but that's basically what i'm feeling like that's it's like it's like imagine yourself already have lived years like you're in the future but you just don't know it until now and like your memories start kicking in like deja vu from the future i believe it was important for you to see that um i called you didn't i yes you did wow wow dude that's insane like what the heck it's like memento but like just like like if if you told the story of memento in a five-dimensional level how i i don't know ah the music building is just oh my god it's like it's so good man it's so good wow like i'm getting a lot of christopher nolan vibes from that too because it's dealing with time you know which is a very commendable thing [Music] gone disappeared thin air dude that's just like this is just like probably one of my favorite portrayals of just communicating with aliens that i've seen in a while a very long time this was a commendable film and the whole time she knows that's what hurts man like she knows that is just brutal man it's brutal but she saved everyone you know what surprised me the most that wasn't meeting them is meeting you damn that line hurts so bad that line hits man damn man dude i mean again guys this part's probably muted for y'all but like the feels the emotions and the fact that she's aware of it all you know just make sure just appreciate it even more yeah guys and that is the end of arrival all right everybody we just got done finishing up our re-watching of arrival and man i'm so happy i rewatched this because i just i appreciate it just through the roof to the moon and back on my second time and just you know having a better understanding of what was really being you know showcased as on top of like the beautiful cinematography and the pacing of this film i think this film is just excellent it's a plus material not only have i've never seen anything like i mean anything quite like it this takes just sci-fi to a whole new meaning a lot of the times we think of sci-fi as this you know action adventure um you know just journey of the universe and it 100 is but that's just one out of the trillions and infinite possibilities where you could take sci-fi and i remember this comment that i remember reading on one of our sci-fi videos that we watched i i don't know what video it was but you know they said that oh yeah actually sci-fi is something that's already been tapped into you know you can't really do anything more with it it's actually being worn out and then you have films like arrival coming in and saying nah nah you guys were just dealing with all the action what about communicating what about that and incorporating it with psychological storytelling that is very personal and implementing time travel in a way or like time uh dimensions all of that and then even better the alien designs what like it was just so haunting but like there was this gentle abstraction to them their designs were just so [Music] so real it's it's it's quite interesting to say that because again this is imagination this is purely imagination but it was really grounded with reality not even just on how humans would react but just aliens that's incredible that's super awesome so guys let me know what your thoughts are in the comments below i would love to hear them especially for this film like always guys stay healthy and stay hydrated because we are just getting started purple jacket pocket full of wheat everything that i should ever need grab some matches cause they give em free just like my time hair pulled back in the backseat
