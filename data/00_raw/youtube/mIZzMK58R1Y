[Music] [Applause] [Music] yo what's up team I am back in the building let's go ahead and dive right into the spoiler free review of Marvel's Avengers endgame let's talk story let's talk script story I thought the story was very creative we have a 22 film build up and this is a final act and they were able to make that into a three hours story I thought that was tight however I felt it was very messy because when you think about it you have a ten year plus build-up right 22 films and you come with a messy but creative story yeah I'm in the middle with the story let's talk about script keep it one hunting with you guys I gotta keep it real I gotta keep it that that's me this was one of the worst MCU superhero scripts I've ever seen this script had problems major problems let's break it down this script had no character development the script was not designed for newcomers the script required you to watch 22 films this script had one of the most inconsistency when it came to power six inabilities this script also [ __ ] on a lot of characters this was a bad script this script debunked the whole universe this was a bad script I did not like this script this was a trash script and what makes it worse this script tried to combine itself with the story and the story was messy and the script is messy well we got a messy-ass journey problems didn't like the script at all trash let's talk about the acting I thought the acting was really good even though the script was bad the actors were better than the script the actors still made you feel like you were watching superheroes it was like the actors took it into their own hands to make this movie it's like literally the actors freestyle this film see some characters were done poorly but the actors did the best they could do with what they had and with this script they had nothing let me give you example so let's say they say Raj we want you to play Optimus Prime in the next Transformers what I'm like all right well you want me to do voice nah we want you to stay in normal human form but we want you to be Optimus Prime right so I'm like okay and action oh the matrix right right that's all I got right and they're like you did great G but you suck as Optimus that's how it was you did great Thor Chris F Chris hands what you did great but your Thor suck you see I'm saying it's like that Mark Ruffalo you did a good job go [ __ ] you did great if we do this how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before the we gonna use you did a great job right but you suck as The Incredible Hulk that's how it was the actors did their part it's just with some characters they just didn't have nothing nothing it was like we just gotta keep coming to our job we got to make the audience still make I'm still looking as the superheroes and the actors did their part let's talk about directing they're also brothers so many people say Andros we trust I am NOT one of those I've seen a decline status and they're doing their directing abilities and I have to say this they did an okay job but for two heads they could've did better there are certain scenes when directing really matters those shots right and I felt they didn't give me those shots they didn't give me the dramatic shots yeah you can send a scene up but there's a certain way of directing it for you truly to really fill certain things there were so many setups to fill stuff but she didn't fill it well I didn't fill it and I wasn't going in trying to be a hard critic or nothing I felt the emotions trying to come but they're they're directing just didn't seal the deal dramatic shots didn't seal the deal some action parts didn't seal the deal and they're they're there their vision their shots were just kind of off to me it felt not organic it felt rushed you know I mean it just didn't feel right the directing was cool but I've seen better from them I've seen them give me something that was like well you want to scream yeah not saying you don't get that in this movie but some parts we're leading up to that and they fell flat this is what had me out of my seat this is what was fun visuals this is a visual film the world the acts the abilities the power sets the heroes the costume the visual everything the CG the visual effects were dope I loved it I loved the visual effects I thought the visual effects were amazing in this movie seeing the actors right this is a crazy stuff this where the actors did the job they were behind green-screen most of this film and for them to not even meet each other most of the time doing their scenes they did a phenomenal job with the visuals it made me feel like they were all there at the same time and I loved it I loved it the visuals were dope in this movie I had no problems with the missiles let's talk about entertainment was j-3 entertain I'll be honest you had three acts in this film you had the first act second act third act right three hours throughout that whole three-hour film I was entertained but this is the crazy thing I was entertained in a different way right I'm entertaining a 10 year plus build-up I'm entertained on what's gonna happen to my Avengers you seem saying I had emotional attachment of entertainment to these characters because I'm be honest with you the first and second act really wasn't action based entertainment it was more of a concern entertainment I was concerned for my heroes and I think Marvel knew that coming in with a three-hour film I was entertained by what could happen how are you going to get out of this how you gonna fix this mess right so I'm entertained by my heroes the third act had me visually emotionally action-packed entertainment whoa mind blown entertainment but I really was entertained throughout this movie there was some parts that kind of took me out of it but that's because the script was just that damn bad let's talk about the music and sound first thing first the music we all get the epicness but the music fell flat and I blame the Russell's for that because their Direction didn't allow the music to enhance the scenes you see them saying you'll play the music but that scene just doesn't carry in and fill in well with what you're showing me let alone the script is back you know I mean so the music was cool it was there I got it but when you take music and you're directing a script is kind of off and nothing in is that balance the music never gives you that climactic scene but the sound was amazing I love the sound oh my gosh and Thor swing that [ __ ] hammer do you know I mean a storm breaker man that [ __ ] sounded great I'm like oh no oh the [ __ ] Oh poop the beans from I'm ant-man amazing the sound was tight I loved it I love the sound sound was beautiful let's talk about some pros let's talk about some cons pros I love seeing Captain America what a pro Iron Man Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as The Incredible Hulk and Chris Hemsworth as Thor I love seeing them I love seeing those characters the pros of this movie was me still feeling like they're my adventures that was a major pro for me as a fan and a film goer because I was still able to feel that even though the script didn't give me it I was still able to see them as heroes that's a pro for me another pro and this is weird a lot of people are gonna you know another Pro for me is how they handle Captain Marvel yes I say two things about this character first things first they handle her will they gave her enough where it wasn't like don't do this to me what are you doing I came to see my Avengers just know this they gave her her time and it wasn't a problem second thing brie Larson is a very pretty woman and they were able to show me that she's a pretty woman right besides us elbows right they was able to show me who she's a pretty woman recommendation brie Larson dropped the Hillary Clinton suits be the woman I'm just saying you're pretty like be the one like I've no problem with like just search scenes I was like whoa okay okay machines only one there's a character in his movie yo and I have some I had a thing for in his film yo um hear me out this is a pro this character has been in multiple films right but we never know we never noticed her like that right because her older more attractive sister was always in the shine but after infinity war her sisters no longer there so now it's all eyes on nebula uh Karen Gillian I think that's how I say her name um she was sexy in his movie the way that woman walked oh my gosh she can walk that runway like had me feeling some type of way I had to tap ac3 like yo G God dead she's like I know it's that walk she was sexy in this movie I don't know she had a freaking hand she's she's having denims after up but she still was all woman under that sheet man and she went fooling me I like nebula in this [ __ ] film she was a pro for me my was like goddamn this is the probe I love it I love it Oh beautiful um the other pros will spoil the movie so I'm just gonna keep it at that cons oh this we got a lot of them that script is a con and what makes it that much worse as a con is the fact that every movie has flaws and plot holes and up and down heartbeats right but when the average film goer can notice it that is a con that is just a disaster it made me feel like they were like if the story the audience wouldn't care anyway they're not even here for a story they're just here to see the heroes and that was a con for me I didn't like that one bit I didn't like the idea of the script being that much of a Clyde hole device like that was a problem for me that was a major kind knowing that the script was that much of a disaster another con I had is certain characters man this is this is certain characters time to shine and goddammit they still didn't shine it's like I was bamboozled I was bamboozled truly and I feel some type of way towards that I said in our reaction I felt like they were gonna bamboozle me and I was right I was bamboozled for the most part for a lot of characters a lot of scenes a lot of situations and I'm glad I expected him because it can really it would have really hurt me right here tough if I let that if I didn't you know acknowledge it then um the other cons spoilers let's go ahead and grade Marvel's Avengers and game I'm gonna do it differently this time cuz I want to make sure you really hear what I'm saying right for story and script I'm going to give this movie story a script gets a D+ write story script is a d-plus the acting gets an A I love the acting in this movie they're directing the Russo brothers you got two individuals I felt coulda did way better than what they gave us the directing gets a c-plus visuals though were phenomenal they were fun vibrant colors Supes powers dope I give visuals in a my entertainment I was entertained throughout this movie but for different reasons emotional attachment to my characters concern 22 movies built to to film build up 10 years plus in the making I give my entertainment a B+ music and sound the music was there it just didn't hit but the sound was amazing I give that up B let's round this off I give Marvel's Avengers end game a b-minus that's being 100 that's being fair I enjoyed the movie but it had his problems I broke them down for you
