hello,0.054463096
everybody my name is Brandon Nikita Brando critic and today we will be discussing a star is born,0.08243091
yes,0.036876976
I know it is rather,0.0594195
late this movie came out quite a few months ago life got in the way here we go,0.10121324
so I just want to state rap the bat that I have not seen any other versions of this movie I haven't seen the movie in the 50s,0.071178876
I haven't seen the movie from the 70s,0.036825836
the 2018 version is the only version I've ever seen,0.082550235
so we have Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga,0.3763422
going on this musical adventure together Bradley Cooper is Jack,0.07795342
this really famous country slash rock singer and his career is kind of waning down because he is an alcoholic a drug addict and his life and his music and his career is just devoid of passion at this point,0.69542736
and he's just going towards drugs and alcohol to try to fill that void until Ali comes along played by Lady gaga and she's just singing in some random bar Bradley Cooper's Jack sees her and then he starts to get some passion again in his life and passion in his music,0.16092399
and of course they fall in love and a star is born,0.12760074
so a lot of my friends that have seen this movie they really love it,0.07095137
they say Brandon you got to see this,0.10934984
I can't with you've waited this long to go see it,0.16273813
I know life has gotten in the way but for me it's funny how a person's love for a movie really works because I can go through each aspect of filmmaking in this movie the directing screenwriting cinematography editing sound design the songs,0.07490267
I'll talk about the songs,0.057496257
and I can say that Bradley Cooper and the filmmaking team did a great job at every aspect of the filmmaking process but I can't say that I love this movie when you say that you love a movie it's that unexplainable gut feeling that this film has impacted you in a way that no other film has and you'll remember it forever,0.05948668
that's why you love a movie a star is born,0.14927821
I will remember it for quite a long time because this movie is emotionally heavy,0.2020375
it's not such a light-hearted movie that you can just walk in smile and leave and though that was a nice movie,0.101486035
no,0.06626663
it does make you think it makes you really feel because this movie is powerful,0.10845052
but I don't know if I love it that's a whole other category,0.089157924
but since this movie is really good,0.09404697
and it's really well made,0.035111383
you might love it cuz,0.10234825
I know a lot of people do that doesn't mean that,0.05107186
there's no scenes in the movie that I love,0.070620835
there are definitely some moments that I did tear up in this movie guys,0.13235277
it is rare for me to do that,0.09684386
but the songs oh my god when Lady Gaga performed that song I started to tear up it was wonderful and you can see her when she's singing the song that she's playing this character who's this lowlife I may be not low life,0.28290397
but this unfamous person just trying to make her way in the world,0.18854451
she works for a shitty job,0.94992846
and she's just doing these gigs of these drag bars,0.31146023
she wants her voice to be heard,0.15104327
and then as soon as she sings her song that she wrote and she kind of does the oh my god I can't leave this is happening,0.09550131
but she keeps singing,0.23978063
it's it's powerful stuff and Bradley Cooper's a good director for bringing that out because a director's main job is to get the best possible performance out of his actors or her actors whoever is directing the movie but Bradley Cooper man he knows how to direct a movie because those emotional scenes,0.1559067
especially when Lady Gaga is singing her song that she wrote in front of him all these people she starts to just oh my god I can't believe it,0.13303259
and that is great acting great directing and great chemistry between the two of them,0.05939065
and that's another reason why I really enjoyed this movie was because of the chemistry between Bradley Cooper's Jack and Lady Gaga's Ally,0.06903181
you know I've seen Lady Gaga perform all throughout my high school days because that's when she got popular with Just Dance pokerface and I've seen her sing at the Oscars,0.14987265
so I didn't see her as just like this party girl I saw her as this elegant singer who can sing like the really powerful music,0.12180038
but now after seeing this I know that she can act as well I mean Lady Gaga is now becoming one of my favorite performers and I have so much more respect for her because she can sing the pop songs,0.120442435
she can sing the really classical tunes,0.07462456
and then she can also act in this movie and her chemistry with Bradley Cooper is unprecedented because you really feel like these characters are in love,0.088887624
you don't actually see Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper acting you see Jack and Hallie fall in love and you go through all the relationship problems that they go through and it feels real it really does feel real and even when the movie was going on and there was some slower parts,0.15383863
I did feel my attention span start to Griese,0.17320296
and i was starting to think about other things like okay,0.081289336
what am I gonna do after the movie I'm kind of hungry,0.23957132
I want to go to Montana's but they just closed it down,0.16731128
you know thinking of things that don't really matter in the movie but what brought me back into it was Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's connection with each other their chemistry,0.09386819
and that is what really sells this movie and when they sing together they're singing chemistry,0.09355505
and the songs,0.06424494
they elevate that chemistry even more,0.07566816
so those were the best parts of the movie,0.065313436
and lastly I also like that this film brought up the topic of fame and fortune and how it's not always so glamorous,0.08080565
you know you see these stars on TV,0.060589116
and you think oh my god,0.08452424
I wish I could be just like them,0.08039136
you know we look up at celebrities,0.08663894
and I mean I'm very fortunate enough that I have a roof over my head and I have a good family but you know you can't help but look at those celebrities and think oh my god I'd be amazing to have a house like this and to have a career like this,0.09303393
and have everyone idolize you and you know it's the grass is always greener,0.09215579
on the other side right,0.06728076
you can take a look at a celebrity and you say oh my god,0.0857913
I wish I could be just like them,0.08039135
but then you start to realize that yes being a celebrity has a lot of perks,0.07956119
yes you generally get paid a lot more,0.11402031
you have a lot of fans,0.10132791
and you get to do what you love singing acting being an athlete who knows but then as well it becomes a whole other set of issues comes with it right,0.08615217
you may not have the same issues that you have right,0.14889745
now just being a normal everyday person,0.11044871
but then you have different problems with different perks,0.10936947
so it's a catch-22,0.10929433
yes you would like to be famous but you still have a whole other issue and a whole lot of other problems that go with it,0.09244767
and you see it in this movie you know as soon as Lady,0.32530317
Gaga's,0.028267438
Ally becomes famous you know as soon as the star is born,0.09919311
then it becomes a whole their issue,0.107403226
right,0.04255815
she wanted to become a singer thought she could share her voice and share her passion for music which she does,0.32374895
but then you know when her agents like will you need to this image right,0.08647971
we need to make you a brand a product to sell to customers,0.094533816
so she's not just a singer she's a li she needs to have her look she needs to have her dance,0.26738536
she needs to have her type of persona,0.25494975
Michael Jackson didn't just sing he sold his look his dance numbers his music videos is brand right as soon as you get that big you become a brand not just a person,0.14961103
and you might think that people are manipulating you into being a certain way to get more money,0.15427157
but that's the life right,0.09214298
and then of course it brings jealousy upon relationships because I will never know what it's like to date,0.19665118
a famous person,0.10430842
I mean I've never seen ever but as as at this point right now my life,0.10883556
I've never dated anyone famous and I will never know what it is like to date a famous person or to date,0.17444403
someone as a famous person right,0.14956704
so you can only see this movie,0.09847401
and think it brings a whole other set of challenges,0.051274844
yes you would like to be famous,0.083887376
and you'd like to meet all these new people and have a lot of people idolize you but then again relationships and dating having a family your career,0.11170316
it's a whole other set of issues that you have to deal with,0.0984217
and I like that this film brought that into its story and actually became a big part of the story and no spoilers but I knew how this movie was gonna end right from the beginning,0.05729132
there is a little bit of early foreshadowing in this movie and I saw it right away,0.15168306
and I said okay,0.06850829
well that's gonna happen,0.07084614
but every single person I've talked to didn't notice it,0.07721044
and this is not people on the internet,0.27954298
it's not people on YouTube or Instagram it's just people that I know personally and they say oh I didn't see that in the beginning,0.1018097
how did you know that that was gonna happen,0.079083815
so if you spot it you can kind of guess where it's gonna go,0.08912909
but if you don't notice it,0.07937832
then that's movie will take you on a loop,0.095841214
so all in all I'll give a star is born' a four out of five because again,0.094051085
it's one of those movies where I can look down every single aspect of the filmmaking and say okay Bradley Cooper knows how to make a good movie,0.10904657
and he delivers an emotionally impactful,0.24738811
one a really strong movie did it impact me in a way that I can see that I love it like a Bohemian Rhapsody did it didn't,0.08831301
but that's the beauty of movies it impacts people differently,0.09495184
so I can clearly say that a star is born is a great movie,0.059283372
and I do recommend it to everyone out there,0.06769441
because although I might not love it it might impact you in a way to say that you of it or it might be your favorite movie ever,0.15203613
it's a good movie,0.07101371
let's check it out for yourself,0.16263235
so anyways guys thank you so much for watching,0.10977148
I know this review is very late this movie came out quite a while ago,0.11427023
but I finally was able to see it along with Creed 2 that review is coming up soon,0.061693005
so thank you again for your patience,0.057100847
