what does it flick fans,0.113219075
and welcome back to my channel,0.07091015
I just watched the brand new Bradley Cooper directed movie a star is born and I feel like I'm like the last one of my youtube critic friends to watch this movie there have been so many early screenings it's kind of early it's Wednesday I guess but I finally got to see this film that I was also excited for if you guys don't know how my reviews work,0.051559757
I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score,0.17196107
so many reviews coming out this weekend,0.061224543
but right now we are talking a star is born,0.04484047
let's get right into it,0.078580566
so a musician helps a young singer and actress find fame even as age and alcoholism sins his own career into a downward spiral,0.15079166
and that's actually the first time I've read that synopsis pretty accurate and if you hear that premise and you haven't heard any buzz about this film you're gonna say Austin hold on okay,0.10051634
this is a movie that I have heard before I've seen it before,0.078900605
what can you do different,0.06275625
what can you do to impress me,0.1451371
what can you make me do to want to seek this film and watch it more than any other movie in theaters right now especially with a little movie coming out called venom,0.15533532
it's going to be hard to top that so it all comes down to is this movie going to appeal to the mass audience,0.10932331
and I can 1000% say I absolutely think it will this thing is a crowd-pleaser if I have ever seen one but it's not just that right,0.07634088
this is some beautiful filmmaking on top of technical goodness on top of great,0.10189632
and I mean great cinematography and it all comes down to Bradley Cooper,0.14956282
I mean this guy he has been one of my favorite actors for a long time,0.2483576
he can do blockbusters he can do psychological films he can do independent movies,0.17773828
but now I think the guy has proven that he can literally do anything,0.16316105
he trained himself how to play the guitar,0.15277752
he learned how to sing I'm sure he already knew how to sing but he perfected that and my goodness,0.07529445
he steals the show in terms of his performance,0.27983138
he was so good in the role,0.08693519
but the big factor here was he brought in Lady gaga right and we have never really seen her act,0.17302954
now she was on American Horror Story I heard she did well but I didn't get a chance to check her out and she is 100% in her element here she is a singer a star in real life and she gets to portray those things on screen,0.100663915
and that's one of the reasons why I think she works so well is because yes she is in her element,0.11040375
I want to see her expand from this,0.18229884
I would like to see her in a different role something you wouldn't expect from her but that being said I do think,0.14588615
she did a very very very good job,0.09301142
she conveyed emotion better than I thought,0.099025205
she would she is definitely going to get nominated for an Oscar,0.08428443
now for me should she win,0.11454972
I don't know if I'm ready to say that it's definitely not the best female performance,0.26897088
I have seen all year but she was very good she was in her element,0.068376735
she deserves to be nominated for that fact and her performances in this movie were so powerful,0.20237038
that's one thing,0.06607733
she can do she can sing the lights out,0.107305326
and she literally sang the lights out in our theater because it was dark,0.10764906
she was great Bradley Cooper was great Sam Elliott Dave Chappelle had a supporting role,0.08871176
now it was very very very minor like,0.055804007
I said the look at the film the shot selection the sound the sound design in the theater,0.061667174
and it may just been the theater that I was in but my goodness guys I felt like I was in a concert,0.07583485
the first third of this movie there are so many performances on stage,0.08570589
just the way that it's filmed the way that it follows Bradley Cooper around right down to the conversations that people have how the camera tracks them,0.09076304
I love the way this thing was filmed and that once again we are bringing this back to Bradley Cooper the man has given us,0.09195242
one of the best first directing jobs,0.06141441
I have seen in I want to say decades it,0.07160965
got such an emotional response out of the audience I was sitting there I'm not gonna lie at times,0.1543458
I was so emotionally invested in these characters okay what's going to happen next,0.094413325
I think I know what's going to happen next which I'll get into that a little bit later,0.2594262
but I still really enjoyed it for what it was,0.053856913
and I hope I'm not selling this the wrong way guys I didn't just enjoy this movie I thought this movie was phenomenal,0.094906844
I'm just telling you that it takes all of these cliche things that we have seen before and it reinvents them,0.11583187
so well I'm still sitting here trying to collect my thoughts like okay,0.11659661
what did I like about this,0.06775828
and why was this done so well because it is it's not my genre right,0.105876066
it's not the kind of film that I see myself going back to over and over,0.08116967
but a star is born is absolutely an exception just because of how well it was made but the biggest thing for me when reviewing a film is all,0.07630255
I can tell you is how I felt while I was watching the movie how invested was I in these characters did I buy the relationship,0.0850576
because if you don't buy the relationship you're not going to buy the rest of the film and the relationship was awesome,0.06005673
you know when he first discovers her in that bar from there on out,0.10246231
and there's a lot of humor in here too I just reminded myself of how funny some of those scenes were in the bar the first I will say the first half of the film is full of some great realistic humor,0.07162901
and that's one thing I'm going to keep saying about this movie is it's realistic when you're talking about the story the way that it goes,0.065134525
some things that are happening in their personal lives,0.07300304
it's a very down-to-earth and grounded story,0.08054093
it's not we're gonna put some Nicholas Sparks in here and we're gonna talk like this to let you know there even,0.09038645
though that doesn't make any sense and we're gonna do this even though that's not realistic,0.06983349
no this is not a Nicholas Sparks movie I want people to understand that people who do not want to see a star is born trust me when I first saw the trailer I'm like oh it's a great trailer,0.080996305
I just don't know if there's movies for me this movie is for everyone even if you don't like a good romantic comedy,0.25605747
this isn't really a romantic comedy but you know what I mean in terms of negatives,0.09191851
I mean I don't have very many there are some things that are foreshadowed in the beginning and it's very obvious that Bradley Cooper was foreshadowing those things,0.104053795
so I can't say that it's necessarily a negative even though they hinted very strongly towards what was going to happen at the end,0.07198197
if you pay close attention you'll know what I'm talking about,0.112672925
especially there's a scene at the beginning just pay attention to that scene,0.08782502
but yeah I kind of knew what was going to happen,0.061167944
but in this case that doesn't really matter predictability wasn't an issue,0.07092829
for me because the journey to that destination was so well done and if you can do that I can forgive the fact that the plot was a little predictable,0.07104508
and it's also predictable because this is a remake this has been done before,0.07379094
now I have never seen those other movies so I don't really have anything to compare this to and maybe that's why I love this movie so much maybe I am completely wrong,0.081762716
and the other films are a lot stronger than this one,0.110189185
but I've never seen those movies and like I said Lady Gaga was fantastic,0.24211904
she is in her element and I'm not taking anything away from her do not misquote me because I thought she was worthy of a nomination,0.1759992
I just don't think she's going to win this year because it's not the strongest performance I have seen and there are still many movies to come but getting a home run your very first time at bat okay I'll take it,0.110919066
and maybe one or two of the scenes that were supposed to knock me out with that emotional punch did not knock me out like,0.25073427
I think he'd intended to especially towards the end the other eight or nine that we're supposed to and did that definitely overshadows the ones that didn't,0.0736352
so I definitely think this movie will get you emotionally invested even if you're going in with a little bit of hesitation I see y'all out there just like,0.14831321
oh I don't want gonna see the stars born,0.13321789
you,0.10154687
should go see this when you bring us something that is this old yet well-known and spin it in a completely new and fresh and just all-around different version of what we thought that we have seen before,0.08713047
I think you have accomplished a task that people can rarely accomplish in Hollywood and a star is born did all of those things,0.1285758
I think this movie on a technical level on a filmmaking level is almost flawless on a story level,0.11094781
it's not perfect,0.10506802
it's something that we have seen like I said before but it just hits all of those emotional beats all of the beats that it needed to hit combined with,0.096272446
I think one of the best concert experiences,0.06556528
I have ever had first of all in the movie theater,0.08828089
they felt like I was watching a concert and III just loved every second of the guys this is one of my favorite movies of the year I'm going to give a star is born right now a 95 percent,0.07473073
I just think this movie is everything that you want in a crowd-pleasing emotional gut punch of a film,0.49128768
and those are my thoughts on a star is born,0.05166295
but the most important question that I have for you guys,0.052004516
