if you love movies you've probably heard of akira kurosawa many times if your film appreciation journey is still young however you might not realize just how many of your favorite films have been inspired by Kurosawa's works George Lucas was heavily inspired by the hidden fortress while making Star Wars even Seven Samurai his personal favorite of Kurosawa's used white transitions something Lucas did often in every Star Wars film the true genius of Kurosawa I think and tell you've seen a few of the films and then you've been able to see other films at the same time and be able to realize his visual style but my favorite of all time is really Seven Samurai Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars was an unsanctioned remake of your Jimbo and of course the Magnificent Seven is a loose remake of Seven Samurai let me say it simply I mean Kurosawa was my master and so many others the master of so many other filmmakers over the years I set among generations of filmmakers and film lovers and watched those astonishing visions he was able to conjure up his imagination and completely rendered them on the screen and there's plenty more but Kurosawa's influence and the techniques that he used especially in Seven Samurai have been felt far beyond just remakes or retellings of his films today's action epics and action films in general Oh everything to Kurosawa and specifically Seven Samurai just like the good the bad and the ugly shaped the modern Western and we cannot escape the shadow of the good the bad and the ugly whenever we watch a Western we are still feeling the impact of Seven Samurai today which is arguably Kurosawa's most known film and while I do love you Jimbo and Rashomon this influential 1954 classic is my personal favorite and people have been talking about Seven Samurai for decades there's very few new things that I can bring to the table so the best that I can do is try to appeal to the audience that I have I know a lot of you are hardcore film lovers and a lot of you have seen Seven Samurai and tons of other classic films I know a lot of you study film go to college but I also know that I have a large demographic of people who are younger who've never experienced films like these before and it can be a little daunting for one thing it's three hours and 27 minutes long it's also black and white and it's subtitled these are all very scary things to people who are just starting their film appreciation journey but I'm here to reassure you Seven Samurai is one of the best films ever made for a reason the conversation that surrounded Kurosawa for years revolves around heaps of praise and appreciation for all he did for film but what's often glossed over and forgotten while reflecting on his work was his prowess as an entertainer this film is delightful dare I say even a little heartwarming it's message about building people up rather than tearing them down is going to be timely forever and it's a film that doesn't feel like it's a task to watch even though it has such a long runtime and if you're new to Cora Sabo you may be thinking you're getting into something difficult I remember the first time I watched films like these in my teenage years I remember those times and some of the films I'm going to be talking about this year in my pre-1970 series are those films that I discovered and that helped me boost my appreciation for film but there's anxiety and there's also elation simultaneously about these films because you might be concerned what if I don't like this film that everyone says is so good but at the same time you're about to watch a film with fresh eyes that's considered a classic and it's exciting within the first 15 minutes you know you're in the hands of a master there's been much discussion about Kurosawa's brilliant framing and especially the way he uses movement definitely check out the channel every frame a painting which sadly is no longer producing content they made a really great video about the way Akira Kurosawa uses movement in his films nearly every shot in Seven Samurai is filled with depth with characters standing near us movement behind them and great distance visible in the frame something is always moving and shifting in and out of frame it's absolutely stunning this also has one of my favorite characters ever in any movie that of kikuchiyo played by Toshiro Mifune the legendary actor his performance is infused with physicality tragedy and even slapstick one shot of him jumping down a steep hill without a single hint of fear shows his dedication to the role his attempts to prove himself to the other samurai are endearing never annoying his seems scolding the samurai about their treatment of the farmers is a real highlight as well as the eventual reveal about his characters past and part of me is always wondered if akira toriyama was ever inspired by this character while he crafted goku for his manga Dragonball because the character of kikuchiyo is extremely similar in a lot of ways he's very optimistic he's a little bit of a klutz but at the same time he's very excited about battle he's often hopping up and being very physical just like Goku is when he knows he's about to get in a fight and I'm curious just how much inspiration he drew from this character while literally drawing Goku Takashi Shimada is also a highlight as the loving leader of the samurai his firm resolve regarding saving others in battle and thus saving yourself is one of the touching messages behind Kurosawa film and while we watching this movie to prepare for this review it's very obvious that a film like this would not be around today it would be shaved by an hour at least with relevant character drama removed in favor of action sequences gratefully The Criterion blu-ray actually preserves the intermission which by the way there's something inherently beautiful about an intermission it's tough to explain I think it has to do with the fact that you're given this period to breathe about what you just saw and reflect on what it means for the characters something else that Kurosawa understands very well and particularly in this film is the use of character perspective a point of view that he turns to most often is the youngest of them all who falls for one of the women in the village through his eyes we experienced the first initial horrors of war for instance in a scene with three Scouts we see it play out his perspective and we get nervous because he's getting nervous the point of view that Kurosawa chooses highlights the feeling he wants the audience to have I think it's one of the reasons Monet is so incredible we often see him from the point of view of the other samurai because they think he's a bit of an oddball but in the moments where his character is given the opportunity to take over the whole frame he lets his real self out and it's captivating the battle sequences are still absorbing today and it shows just how observant Kurosawa was with his immaculate framing and I've always felt sorry for some of the stuntmen particularly this guy because that [ __ ] looks genuinely painful if you've never seen this film there's a reason you've heard about it countless times its Reach is unparalleled in our modern cinematic landscape and if you're about to watch it for the first time I envy you I'm gonna give Seven Samurai and a plus guys thank you so much for continuing to watch this series of pre-1970s reviews I'm honestly having a blast doing this I'm thinking about continuing it beyond 2018 because I feel like it's just important that people are discovering films like this and watching them because it's really easy for us as film lovers especially people my age to assume that everyone's seen these films already but there's tons of people every day who are experiencing films like this who are discovering films like this go or maybe apprehensive about putting in a film like this because like I said it's black and white it's very long it's subtitled we need to encourage these types of films more often guys thank you so much as always for watching if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes
