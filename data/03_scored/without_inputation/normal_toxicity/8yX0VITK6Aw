today we are going to be beginning our discussion of five star plus movies now a five star plus movie isn't just a good movie,0.05360576
and it isn't just a great movie,0.053025357
it's a movie that makes you stand in awe,0.110381715
because of how incredible the art of filmmaking can be a five star plus film is one that has left,0.054534454
its mark on the film industry one that when you look at the modern-day movie these are the reasons that it's there today I'd like to make one of these movies every month as we look at the best that cinema has to offer first one,0.057517454
we are going to be looking at is a very surreal German expressionistic film called the cabinet of dr.,0.053419214
Caligari,0.030955056
now this is a fantastic early horror film that was released in 1919,0.078544594
so I will be discussing spoilers but seeing as this film is nearly a hundred years old,0.09762662
if you haven't seen it,0.08498782
now I think it's the time to do so so without further ado let's look at the magic that is the cabinet of dr.,0.058163557
Caligari the film officially begins when we see these two men talking,0.08343027
now one of them we are soon going to find out his name Francis,0.071844384
and he is going to be our main character,0.0799996
the other is just a man who he is able to tell his story to all the sudden a ghostly figure appears,0.13912663
and Francis tells the other that that woman is his wife and he begins to tell the story of how she became the way that she did let's take a moment to appreciate that,0.112599544
this is a nonlinear narrative released in 1919-20 two years before Citizen Kane in 75 years before Pulp Fiction which are both two films that are known for innovating the nonlinear style,0.06578304
but this did it long before either these were around the film cuts to the town where one of the men grew up and we see this incredible backdrop this is probably what the film is best known for these vivid and surreal images that really show that you're living in a world with different rules you're out looking at Germany you're looking at something very different,0.06341375
and the choice of backgrounds helped make this movie so much better shadows were colored in everything that you're seeing was hand-drawn,0.1561826
it really shows that this is the art of filmmaking the background also shows the oppression of the German regime,0.22600941
all of the houses are built on a hill with the castle on top of it showing the oppression of the common folk by those in charge and those with wealth,0.055823263
we are introduced to really our main antagonist dr.,0.06784758
Caligari and what this film did so well was used this film to tell the story instead of describing an evil man you can actually see him,0.27340308
this is really the first time that cinema as an art was able to show not only art,0.118023805
but also storytelling,0.050308846
this shot in particular reminds me of a dr.,0.15376507
Seuss drawing now albeit,0.07797564
this is the scariest dr.,0.089829475
Seuss drawing out there,0.049969915
but you see the man in power sitting on an unreasonably large chair leaning over as it checks the public records or on a podium that has literal symbols on it,0.098047964
you don't need to be a genius to pick up some stereotypes about an oppressive regime and knowing what we know about,0.14741616
Germany between World War one and World War two,0.27165774
he may be saying something about the government later we find out that the town clerk has been killed obviously we know who the perpetrator is,0.31089434
and this tells us so much about dr.,0.050822668
Caligari after the town clerk made him wait for only three minutes,0.06245881
he was killed this shows that dr.,0.53183115
Caligari is not someone to be trifled with at the fair which is essentially a metaphor for consumerism,0.074612804
dr.,0.049754996
Caligari sets up his psalm universe and draws a remarkable crowd by telling about his creature after hearing about the wonders of caesar,0.14952525
we were finally told about him,0.045742836
he is 23 years old who has been asleep for the past 23 years we see the creature,0.17622547
and Oh God look at that haircut,0.05209212
look I get,0.037163217
he's been asleep for 23 years,0.1516487
and this was 1919,0.084308624
I come on a bowl cut and all reality however actually really loved this shot shows the pride,0.43028626
dr.,0.049754996
Caligari has for Caesar,0.05958326
it almost looks paternal,0.10313455
this is Caligari his way of making money and killing his enemies,0.83229095
it's all captured in this one shot Caesar wakes up and his 23 years of sleep Caesar began to learn everything present past and future people begin to ask questions,0.12620977
and this part really shows off human greed through wanting to obtain,0.40827426
the impossible like knowing how long you are live your ultimate li and knew your life later that night we see our protagonist being murdered,0.5242281
and this is shown through the use of shadow,0.060001776
obviously the MPAA wasn't around in the 1920s,0.076342724
but there were some guidelines his phone was able to get around these guidelines by using shadow which is very innovative,0.05565267
his friend Frances,0.05589287
remembers what the prophecy was,0.05153879
and now the film is about to get good Francis reports this theory to the law,0.035430066
but is still unsatisfied he decides to go after Caesar and eventually Caligari himself the law catches up with Caligari,0.09974363
and they question him and he's chosen that Caesar is still there and assures him that he has been asleep ever since the fair that day,0.13281775
and he will not rise without him anyway,0.15229012
but the murder is revealed by someone else and Caligari is say at this point Jane the woman from earlier meets dr.,0.15436308
Caligari who shows her Caesar who wakes up and this is without a doubt one of my favorite scenes in the film there was something,0.078955404
so great about the way the Caligari and Caesar look at her as she runs away it is so unsettling and so great that combined with the great score shows off some excellent excellent filmmaking and our next scene which is ultimately a collection of different clips that all happen at the same time francis is checking in to see what dr.,0.061899345
Caligari is doing,0.04991285
he sees him with Caesar,0.09670877
the next part of the scene however shows Caesar breaking into Jane's house with his knife this is so unsettling so creepy and one of my favorite scenes in horror history one of people's biggest complaints with us movies that you see very dry camera,0.22042765
angles every shot is long drawn out,0.31089434
and for the most part almost stationary,0.059780926
but it works,0.047681496
so well in this movies you see Caesar approach the bed knife in hand you see someone line there asleep someone coming to murder,0.45675582
her,0.07769223
there's nothing you can do about it as an audience member nothing anyone can do about it,0.08915241
I'm certain most people are familiar with dramatic irony that Shakespeare perfected which the audience knows something that the characters inside the play do not know however this is the best case of dramatic irony when you're seeing someone about to be murdered,0.15532957
and there's nothing you can do about a Caesar approaches the bed you can just see how well the shot is friend,0.24517065
so well execute Caesar raises the knife to kill and yet he can't do it just like this film source material dracula Caligari falls in love with one of his victims and kidnaps her and again as they leave you get this long shot signifying how there's nothing you can do to try and help her her family rushes in they check the window and see Caesar taking Jane away is such an incredible shot Caesar escapes James family catches up with her and Caesar runs off into the however Caesars reign of terror ends after he falls from a hill,0.26064667
and dies he revealed that the Caesar that we had been seeing earlier was one that Caligari kept was actually a dummy,0.61649406
we find out Caligari is really the real mastermind behind all this francis catches up with Caligari,0.124161124
and he knows that he's behind it they chase each other and Caligari runs into a mental asylum this entire sequence is so well edited together going back and forth between caesar Caligari and francis the police it is really great filming obviously the standards for good editing and good filmmaking today have changed,0.31401733
but this is one of the pioneers of innovative editing instead of just seeing one clip we're seeing a collection of clips all happening at the same time there used to build up suspense and tone and it is so well executed to get such an incredible,0.13071752
no next we see francis follow Caligari to the asylum after he assumes Caligari may be a patient,0.11514804
the hoard is revealed that he's the director albeit this isn't the most shocking twist,0.10519614
you're just introduced to his Asylum minutes ago,0.19001831
and yeah this is one of the earliest cases of a plot twist this crazy old man may not be that crazy,0.69542736
he may be the director of a well established insane asylum,0.5003651
the Francis tells the other hospital employees that he found out in Caligari is now under supervision,0.05974325
what I love about this film's final act is that it isn't so much a horror movie but instead of detectives go you finally learn about the real calendar,0.14069587
this reveal is so great and you get the first dynamic or moving shot in this entire movie you find out exactly what happened the entire time,0.14945772
there's also after the great social stadium you find out why Caligari works in the sounds we find a victim to act as his personal murder cool and whether or not the director intended it or not it ended up being a great social statement,0.11226123
because what we now know about asylum and abuse we get a great transition that goes to a flashback,0.19159749
so yes this makes a flashback in a story that was told to Caligari discovering Caesar for the first time Caligari begins extensive research before setting his monster out on the town and he begins to go crazy he sees demands all over the screen again,0.3095553
this is excellent editing,0.09307126
this is something that has never been done for in film,0.08580331
and yet we're seeing a combination of both what's happening in the real world,0.055838674
but also special effects that happen in post-production,0.07078393
finally we go back to France is talking to the man from the beginning however this film does not end on a positive note,0.1079195
Jane is locked away in the asylum with Caesar only Caesar is out of total personality chained,0.32871693
no longer is he a murdering psychopath but instead someone who's lost and confused playing with flowers in the asylum but then we get the best plot twist of all Francis might be insane,0.5876557
he's locked in the asylum just like everyone else and the film ends on an ambiguous note,0.195583
so was the director of the asylum Caligari or did Francis dream it all up we're never told it's only up to us to guess,0.07633641
so this is truly an excellent film is it a perfect movie,0.0789187
well you could definitely make an argument saying it is however undeniably,0.0810192
this is a very innovative movie the director uses color to show off time of day and similar locations which although it wasn't the first time that this happened it did it in such a great way the film utilized,0.038342632
some great editing techniques some awesome dynamic shots and is all around a truly excellent film,0.15908091
it's one of my favorite horror films out there and definitely one you should watch this time of year,0.13958421

so well directed,0.05584416
