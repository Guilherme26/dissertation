film so the movie centers around this family who is basically dealing with this new,0.033424146
post world of film with creatures who will basically kill you and rip you to,0.757293
shreds if you make a sound okay and so it basically goes through the conflicts,0.078995876
that they're dealing with how are they surviving and how they're kids dealing with the,0.012858665
higher the parents dealing with it and then what happens when they actually have to,0.011981288
come in contact with these creatures and so the movie doesn't really give you that,0.028402677
much of a backstory as to how these creatures got here what happened how'd everybody,0.0655778
disappear or if everyone disappeared basically it starts off from date 89 and what I,0.15531573
appreciate about this movie is it didn't waste time letting you know what the consequences,0.035394423
are if you make a sound if you make that one poor mistake how you're,0.027513992
gonna have to deal with the consequences and they won't be pretty and so I,0.07609967

they are awesome in this movie but I have to talk about these kids yeah,0.025072102
so first of all kudos to for the casting on actually casting a young deaf,0.28394917
woman by the name of Millicent Simmons I really enjoyed her character okay cuz you,0.08331891
see that in order for them to communicate they have to sign to one another,0.03081929
you're kind of wondering like how do they all know the sign language something you,0.063691996

emotions this one can't have me dying with the faces that he was making and,0.10066357
when you watch you you'll know exactly what I'm talking about but I thought the,0.02806809
kids were really good and then it also gave a different point of view from,0.035062496
films like this because it is a horror movie but it's not like a horror,0.05284352
like really gory it's just horrible this is a really like crappy situation to have,0.1456985
to deal with and to see how parents especially will have to navigate through this,0.025529748
with young children and so that's what I found more terrifying in this movie and,0.2541864

you to be acting like this but I thought that it was handled very well,0.06481882
it gets you invested with the characters and I think that's what made the movie,0.01332895
more enjoyable I would have to say this is kind of like a Walking Dead,0.30230907
- the zombies mix with a little bit of signs because why say Walking Dead,0.15153483
is just because hearing the silence and basically is just you surviving with your family,0.031116625
and nobody else is around and so that's why I kind of gave me the,0.07056401
Turner The Walking Dead feel mixed with the science that they have the creatures that,0.09157317
