hey everybody it is october obviously the month of halloween,0.13215029
so i figured i would review a few horror movies and today i'm going to start with us this film was it came out in 2019,0.27812567
and it was written and directed by jordan peele jordan peel had a really fascinating rise to prominence in hollywood he began of course as a comedian as a writer and an actor in sketch comedy he got a start more in mad tv and then eventually he rises up the sketch comedy ranks once he partners with keegan,0.086922966
michael key for the sketch comedy show key and peel and then out of nowhere,0.11494461
he makes his directorial debut with get out which i don't need to tell you was a huge hit and it was widely critically acclaimed it really touched a nerve with audiences because of how it delved into social commentary in a way that people weren't used to in mainstream horror commentary on class and racism and identity but from the point of view of a black man and i think that's what jordan peele wants to be known for at least for,0.41945884
now,0.031218953
he wants to take the idea of horror which is of course an iconic genre for audiences and then subvert those expectations by giving us an unlikely point of view and as a result he has a lot of power,0.11828258
now he's considered to be one of the big rising auteurs,0.120023996
it's a meteoric rise for sure,0.17191
and i think a lot of people were just really thrown off,0.46781197
they were surprised that some guy that was known for acting and sketch comedy and writing and stuff like that could suddenly write this this horror movie but for me i didn't think it was that much of a stretch because get out is more of a social commentary it's kind of satirical but it has horror elements but i always saw it more as like a hority,0.13048396
and i always loved his philosophy,0.07671283
he always believed that there's a really thin line between making somebody laugh and and making somebody scared,0.16657574
and i think he's absolutely right,0.07244191
they're you know totally different reactions at the end of the spectrum but often humor can be blind with it you know like humor can be used as a defense mechanism for fear,0.061669238
or sometimes in really tense terrifying moments,0.117401145
a strange humor can come out of it,0.14978452
so when they kind of bleed together that's when things get really interesting,0.15016311
especially when you can't differentiate the two that's where the crux of the horror lies for jordan peele,0.25161833
and i think he's wonderful at expressing it if you watch sketches in key and peel you can absolutely see that element of like eeriness and horror elements where the humor takes a kind of a sharp turn into unexpected dark territory,0.14962907
i'm thinking personally of course of sketches like megan and andre they're hilarious but there are major elements of of tragedy and darkness,0.092076555
there too like a you know manipulation and abusive relationships,0.37975946
and and megan is a terrifying but realistic villain and i don't know i felt like get out kind of was an extension of that just more fully developed and more interesting of course,0.133189
it's one of the few american mainstream movies in recent memory to be really well structured as in i see almost no fact to trim,0.13082084
the payoffs are clear,0.061675016
the arcs are really really strong overall and there's just something very refreshing about that however when i watched the movie i liked it but i felt like there was something missing i i felt like okay,0.09863404
this is a good start,0.05197474
but i'm very intrigued to see what you're gonna do next because i felt as strong as the story was there wasn't a real style and a sense of tone that matched that i wanted something more cinematic,0.09375501
so he follows that up rather quickly with us and you know i think that he it's kind of a tough thing when you make a movie that starts off so high you have a lot of expectation behind you how do you recreate a cultural moment like that can you recreate it to me,0.09895415
i think you should just move on and try to do something different,0.16735166
and not get kind of crippled under that expectation,0.16753578
but when i look at us i kind of wonder to myself did he truly succeed with it,0.060835283
i mean i think it depends on how you look at it,0.081186526
i think in some ways,0.1602423
yes he did improve on certain aspects of get out in other ways,0.15043999
he didn't we have another horror movie here that is like get out it's very socially politically aware where it's focusing more on the divide between classes and like assimilation and trying to discover your identity when it is so attached to your skin color,0.2425559
or rather,0.054643966
maybe how your skin color is attached to the environment you grew up,0.31146201
in is maybe a better way to say it conceptually on a basic level,0.12475703
i think us is really intriguing and really interesting,0.05238639
i really like the concept behind the tethered having these doppelgangers these copies of the original person that represent the lower class,0.18725747
and how like the privileges of the rich are always depriving the poor also that guilt haunts the rich and the privileged,0.2421866
and just the idea you know that like every bite that you take a child somewhere is starving,0.41175652
and there's always that underlying thing that we know but we rarely face the consequences of that,0.07199731
but unfortunately when you have like the upper class and you have like you know reality the world as it exists,0.1725021
on the outside all of that is is fine,0.064222366
it exists as it does,0.051663935
but then i look at the world of the tethered which is of course underground,0.09008978
and again i like the concept but i feel like it doesn't make a lot of logistical sense and it doesn't feel nearly as fully formed as as as this world up here,0.07793431
however stylistically,0.11196885
i think this movie is really cool,0.083911575
it's definitely very cinematic compared to get out,0.10213377
and there's a lot of detail in the aesthetic that i appreciate and i just love the color palette it has this rich almost like aged technicolor quality,0.065980494
there was a lot of thought clearly that went into the mood of the film,0.05766223
and how they decide to build the suspense elements,0.08607284
and all of that really captured my attention particularly in the opening sequence,0.051379975
i love when adelaide is on the beach and she's going into the fun house with the mirrors and you know having the mirrors be that metaphor for that snap from reality into those metaphors is something that we see a lot,0.07245563
and i mean yes you could say that it is quite cliche,0.08249505
but i felt it was really well directed here and peel seems to be taking a lot of recycled cliches,0.14392644
and again subverting them using familiar tropes but from a different point of view the score is fabulous and i rarely say that about modern movies today especially modern horror movies uh and you know has that coral quality to it which is very kind of spiritual and soulful and haunting,0.10319708
but then there's this weird texture and a kind of an edginess to the instrumentation throughout and i think at times the way that he explores humor,0.16617347
in this movie is really really clever,0.14361128
and when everything in his world just feels a little bit exaggerated,0.35639673
it makes everything a little bit more creepy like david lynch in a lot of ways you know like the tethered they're like these resurfaced harlequin dolls or something or like clowns from the 1950s out for revenge against the people who maybe dismissed them lupita young while i don't necessarily think that her performance here is especially amazing or anything like that,0.48082706
i just think she has an extraordinary face and body that is just pure power and it's very very cinematic,0.27880993
she has just such beautiful skin,0.17287272
but these eyes that pop out and really express a lot of emotion,0.121056855
and that is perfect for the horror genre,0.1552908
but as the tethered version of herself or whatever you want to say there,0.07910879
she does a fantastic job her eyes are bugging out and she is so terrifying and everything is very accented where it's right on the edge and you don't know what she's going to do at any moment that feral quality to her movements is very interesting and she's she's got a great physicality and clearly she's a very good dancer and it's really brilliant to watch i think really that's lucid and young's strength a lot of times is her physicality and the voice she uses you know,0.20705181
it's it's like this feels like it's croaking she's trying to croak her dialogue and there's a real tragedy to that she's fighting and there's a pain to it,0.17631046
but also this vengeful nature to it as well it's very over the top it feels like like i like to say a lot of times right on the edge of farce like kabuki theater or something yet it thrives,0.3997694
in this particular world in the same way that you know like jack torrance thrives in in the shining in kubrick's universe elizabeth,0.15257052
moss is the highlight for me but she she always is i just love her i i enjoyed that aspect of the movie having this small insight into another family the white family's point of view how adelaide or lupita younggo's husband in the movie is you know,0.3072468
he wants to be the man this paternal force,0.15362823
he's trying to provide for his family yet he feels this competition to have all the nice things like you know elizabeth moss's family and i enjoy that aspect of assimilation that's where it really comes out and connecting the families based on that but when you look at elizabeth moss and her family do they seem happy at all no they seem much less connected than adelaide's family,0.062030587
they all seem to hate each other they're and their their privilege has made them weak and distant and just ungrateful,0.6261925
they think they're above little inconveniences but i really like moss also as her tethered version of herself i really don't know how to how to say that,0.28395385
but you know what i mean it's really really creepy,0.24032092
i like it because it is a twisted version of the real version of herself and all the elements of that come out in the conversation at the beginning of the movie when they're on the beach where she's having that discussion with adelaide,0.18633418
she talked about all the things that she wished for had she wanted to be an actress,0.18484738
but then she ended up getting married and having kids and she's just bitter about the life that she chose she's one of those women who feels like oh the best years are behind me like she's some sort of like tennessee williams southern heroine,0.31089434
there's a line where she says she got plastic surgery and she says to adelaide,0.1527375
oh no but you you don't need plastic surgery and you know maybe there's a little bit of jealousy there because you know lupita nyong'o is kind of a like a one-of-a-kind beauty that jealousy that we saw in get out is kind of resurfacing here,0.18333656
i think but i think it all comes out through the very distorted tether version of her and how she is still theatrical where she's literally a laugh away from a tear and that might be one of the most haunting images in the movie for me,0.1549068
she goes over to cut adelaide you know with the scissors and she has the taste and she just can't do it,0.15627098
and then she goes over and does it to herself i'll awesome sort of like black dahlia thing and i love it,0.20827442
i love it,0.06665894
and i guess i just really find that interesting just like the bridge between the doppelgangers and their personality traits their their subconscious but the whole threat of the unconscious mind for all of us is that we're afraid that you know certain toxic angry aspects of ourselves are are going to take over the parts of us that are more healthy and balanced and here all of that is represented through the metaphor of just anarchy and and the idea that class separation is becoming wider and wider between the rich and the poor based on the powers that be and the real threat is the people who are experiencing that and are images of the tethered and how they're standing and they're ready and they're holding hands as though it is some sort of protest,0.13899338
that's really powerful,0.040173847
and yet when you look closer it just doesn't like i said before it doesn't make logical sense especially in the third act the reveal of this experiment that's gone awry is just it's it's half baked,0.12945293
unfortunately i love the look of it it reminded me a lot of the third act of i'm thinking of ending things just this idea of of uh this weird sort of surrealistic void where the self-actualization is going to take place the melding of two aspects of consciousness finding the whole in this case it would be adelaide,0.09841624
and then the tethered version of her when there is the switch which is of course you know like the big twist of the movie where we realized that,0.06535414
the real adelaide is the one that got switched,0.11755687
and then her tethered version is the one living among us,0.11616002
why would she feel the need to mimic what's happening above when she's the real person that wasn't really explained,0.09646415
why is the mirroring happening at certain times and then not at others,0.09657889
so i think this is something that maybe maybe peel thought about in his mind,0.15345688
but it just doesn't really translate is he trying to infer something,0.05634352
and maybe i'm just i'm just not getting it or is he is this more kind of a lazy way to create a plot convenience and don't get me wrong,0.15269452
i love the twist,0.07354993
i really do,0.050154593
i think it's absolutely fantastic,0.09565715
i think it's absolutely tragic in concept but it doesn't work,0.07979283
fully when you think about again the logic behind everything,0.11303472
and therefore it loses a bit of its power,0.15018761
so it feels like just kind of a device,0.13682908
that's used more as a specific twist to change the story up in a way naturally i'm less logic driven just as a person just,0.07421796
that's how my mind works and so i'm a big believer most times of suspension of disbelief in movies but when you have a world like this that depends so much on logic and how your underground counterpart is is feeling the repercussions of things,0.10172634
and how it's all connected,0.048428494
i i think you really need to be kind of clear about that world the world building that way,0.1757593
the payoff that big twist at the end could be fully realized and be opened up because as it stands the twist doesn't take us,0.07732305
in any interesting direction it just kind of solidifies,0.07518537
the point about you know what it means to you know have to break a few eggs to make an omelette and it's really frustrating because there's so much here that i really enjoy and that i'm naturally just just drawn to and i i do think this could have been great,0.2983732
i think it could have been as good as get out,0.1323492
i think it could have been better than get out,0.15207829
but key aspects of it crumble under just the whole nonsensicalness of what's going on here overall,0.11698076
i still like it,0.061443515
i do think it's a cool movie i think it's an entertaining movie i think it's got style and it's got passion and it's trying to say something more,0.18406825
i love peel's world,0.07833254
i love the tone of it and i'm excited to see what he can pull out of it whether he you know explores more in the horror genre or whatever so while it is very uneven,0.13340048
i still think it's worth your time i definitely do recommend it,0.14579692
but i will say that same year parasite came out,0.5273804
and i think if you want to watch a movie that really takes the ideas of class struggle and like privileged guilt and lack thereof,0.19540772
and and the vengeance of the lower class watch parasite,0.6739334
it takes those ideas in a much more clever direction and it's just a stronger stronger more fully realized film but get out is a really fun movie especially for halloween,0.08454958
but that is my review,0.067003936
thank you guys,0.045313165
