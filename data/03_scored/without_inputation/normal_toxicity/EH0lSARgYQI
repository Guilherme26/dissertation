brand new Spike Lee directed movie black clansmen a movie I've been looking forward to,0.115532905
for a long time if you guys don't know how my reviews work I like,0.14829479
to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score and I,0.16542071
have reviewed a bunch of movies over the last three days they're mag crazy rich,0.4581216
Asians and the package please go check those out but right now we're talking about,0.27298206
this movie let's get into it and keep this review shorter than usual so black,0.604513
clansmen let's start with the cast because this cast is so dynamic and good and,0.11132711
Denzel Washington's son give such a great performance something I never knew could come from,0.095309205
well not the family in general because we know Denzel but his son just does,0.063642174
such a good job in his chemistry with Adam driver every time the guy pops,0.12939122
up in a movie I get excited to see it and he's one of the,0.09338411
reasons that this thing drew me in so much he was great their dynamics were,0.15409614
great the relationships that most of the characters had were really good and somebody else,0.026709931
who surprised me Topher Grace really good and the guy who was from I Tania,0.098284885
last year I can't remember his name but oh my goodness he comes out of,0.05602462
nowhere and his character was hilarious he gave a good performance now I definitely need,0.108583584
to hit on this a lot of people are going to see this movie as,0.2791755
heavy-handed whether you agree or disagree with a message there is definitely a message there,0.10056592
and it's definitely coming across on the screen but going into this movie seeing the,0.053549793
trailer you kind of know that that's coming you can see the social cues in,0.063194714
there and if you walk in end up getting really offended at it and not,0.100640655
like the movie for those reasons I think you're missing other points of the film,0.090655655
because yes some people will not like the message not necessarily the message because I,0.122680716
think if you're human you should like the message that we should all love each,0.08312023
other and be together I just think that's the truth but maybe spike directs that,0.10337864
message towards certain people who are watching this movie and I'm not necessarily a big,0.10632746
fan of that fact because I don't like when you're calling people out let's keep,0.24183168
the film in focus but I like what they did with the message and I,0.031061273
think the ending some people aren't going to be on board for it and while,0.15124676
I think it was a little bit too heavy and it it didn't go to,0.14982313
the point to where it offended me and I like the fact that that was,0.108597554
in there because I think we all need that as human beings right now let's,0.36006925
move away from that right now and talk about how good the movie was the,0.08602169
filmmaking here was brilliant I think it might be Spike Lee's maybe his best movie,0.10261958
in a long long time it's not necessarily my favorite because movies like Malcolm X,0.11581813
they're just so good but this movie is up there I will say it's 100%,0.10227918
his best in a few years the way that he interject humor into this story,0.08436416
yet keeping it serious I always talk about tone and how in a lot of,0.07435794
movies it's very inconsistent but here even though the tones tend to shift it does,0.078478456
it in a way that flows so good and it doesn't mess up the pacing,0.07748175
of the movie the pacing here is oh my gosh I love it there's one,0.16894351
point where the film slows down other than that I was engaged from beginning to,0.07299299
end I had to use the bathroom really bad and I always know how to,0.1514575
test a movie if I have to use the bathroom and I don't want to,0.07999542
leave I'm locked in and having a good time and I'm emotionally connected and I,0.12224121
didn't really want to leave even though I had to hurry what a pee to,0.24797067
myself I didn't really notice any technical aspects that I didn't like I thought the,0.043307308
Senate ography was good I liked the shot selection the compositions the color everything about,0.3567098
it was just cool to look at now it starts off there were a few,0.07039318
here and there that kind of bothered me but overall I thought it looked good,0.15503888
it sounded good I liked a story I liked the plot I like to wear,0.06532048
it when I'm not going to spoil anything about that but there's some pretty high,0.09196525
tension when people start to figure certain things out and by the end of the,0.120168984
story you're really rooting for these characters in terms of negatives like I said it,0.06861478
did slow down in parts there's one scene towards the end all I will say,0.19715025
is initiation that scene lasted a little too long for me it cut back and,0.08194783
forth and back and forth between the blacks and the whites and I'm just like,0.36120883
ok they didn't cut the fat a little bit because I think this is going,0.3973819
on a bit too long I think the movie could have been like 140 135,0.08469389
as opposed to pushing two hours but you know what that's just a minor complaint,0.11870765
well there were some shots in there especially at the beginning of just like landscapes,0.14016755
a couple that were thrown in and I was like all right I'm not really,0.07970685
feeling these shots in particular let's get back to the story and what's kind of,0.12966901
serving the purpose here and yes I did say a bit heavy-handed towards the end,0.13414983
I'm not saying it was in your face because I don't like what movies do,0.36266518
that it usually takes it down a couple notches what I feel about the heavy-handedness,0.0979581
is not going to take this movie down and whether I agree or disagree that,0.07394225
doesn't matter I just don't like when you call people out that exist today in,0.25704056
real life some people are going to dig that and whether you're for him or,0.15541172
anti him that doesn't matter when it comes to reviewing this movie if it was,0.15560457
anyone unless you know like Hitler some even call him out as much as you,0.44667825
want but I just don't like what movies do with that whether it's democratic or,0.116690606
republican that always strikes me and rubs me the wrong way and as we get,0.42345512
into my score none of those negatives really took the movie that far down it,0.14404014
is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year and I was,0.038835265
so emotionally hooked and it's weird because these usually aren't the movies that I kind,0.17757797
of latch on to but this one in particular I thought was super well done,0.11315621
and I really enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would I'm going to,0.09009664
get black Klansmen and 87 percent this was a cool film it's got a good,0.23343173
groove a good job good pacing everything about it is just straight-up cool and I,0.15054932
think if you go and watch it you will get something out of it if,0.15050235
not really enjoyed thank you guys so much for watching this video you know my,0.15197848
