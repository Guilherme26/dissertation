here's a bold statement I think Wonder Woman as a film is better than you,0.34567055
think it is that applies even if it's your favorite movie ever made I think,0.078445725
I still might make you like even more however if it's your least favorite movie,0.11431905
of all time hopefully you will gain a new found respect for something I like,0.11277662
to call the fetch this son of Adana crap spelunky what didn't didn't we have,0.79915553
a meeting where I said I'm just gonna quote this off my phone here even,0.07994853
as the temporary name I am NOT okay with calling the secret sauce about Wonder,0.09378367
Woman the fetch ness and quote what is happening to my show used to be,0.28172648
so fetch [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Wonder Woman a movie all about the fetch miss is,0.10146794
a 2017 film directed by patty Jenkins written by Allan Heinberg with a story created,0.07796381
by Zack Snyder someone we're gonna be talking about a whole lot in this piece,0.10985868
Allan Heinberg and Jason fuse Heinberg is known for his work on Grey's Anatomy The,0.0576155
OC Sex in the City and party of five whereas fuchs wrote ice age continental,0.6364068
drift in a scripting the upcoming minecraft the movie Zack Snyder is known most recently,0.09698344
for this and this two films that tie directly into this and something we're gonna,0.10787035
come back to and this isn't the easiest film to talk about but I'm gonna,0.088008605
avoid colloquial burps like it wasn't a perfect movie because no movie is perfect if,0.22861437
movies were perfect we couldn't relate to them I mean one woman is like 500,0.15285043
different things all at once it's a wonderful fish out of water story a gorgeous,0.08436423
World War 1 film a whimsical dissection of mythology as it pertains to like reality,0.17317294
while being the truest vision of a DC character that actually represents the superhero worshiped,0.05770122
by hundreds of millions of people as she actually is not randomly a horrible murderer,0.55100936
you know like the rest of them diana is compassionate and kind and wants to,0.061293263
believe that people are good and ultimately worth saving like she's not exactly at home,0.14897083
and the taps tree she currently resides in which is something I want to lean,0.079132356
on really close this piece the cinematic world surrounding Diana is chaos unmistakable chaos the,0.10368222
architect of this current cinematic cluster verse is very clearly this dude and frankly Batman,0.18899086
V Superior sand then Justice League was God an unknown who has explained in one,0.09735499
word what the tone of Justice Lee was I will wait here and I'm actually,0.061305244
saying is if you're patty Jenkins who I hopefully don't need to explain why the,0.15354112
pressure of her finding success here was monumental was to use a football metaphor trying,0.07494631
to kick a field goal while the goalpost is tell appeared but it first might,0.31089434
appear like odd design choices ie the bad guys in this film who I admit,0.18308303
are so strange but when you realize that those design choices were made to fit,0.06433775
into Zack Snyder's Cinematic Universe in a way where they work at any toned because,0.064952165
literally two disparate movies that sandwich this like pick a tone so pretend that you're,0.27241755
fighting with one hand tied behind your back and you can lose this fight you,0.31089434
lose this for what inescapably represents a lot more than just you air-ground visually there's,0.10644364
a lot of reasons for this this is kind of an idea we've only invented,0.12702958
since marvel this idea of the the pressure of making a superhero movie is actually,0.057615962
far worse than it used to be you're not just making a good Wonder Woman,0.40326902
movie anymore this isn't 1990 all you're making a vertically integrated superhero film that must,0.07998344
share compatibility with what has come before it and and what which comes after it,0.085424475
because it's 2017 it god help us this stupid idiotic social network hell that we,0.9216138
have imprisoned ourselves with is the same hell mistake that allows marketers to gain the,0.24519327
confidence to pull off things like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and more Star Wars this,0.07635255
film is a half-court shot with your eyes closed let's take a moment for the,0.41086406
shared universe guillotine that fell Edgar Wright Phil Lord Christopher Miller and Colin Trevorrow and,0.15124217
that's one hundred percent not a comment on any of those artists I've said amazingly,0.11517063
nice things about literally all of them but it is a comment on this system,0.06534127
that couldn't shift to accommodate them in the ways that they as artists needed the,0.064289905
tightrope is skinnier than it appears so when someone succeeds let alone breaks the mold,0.15413226
that contained it yeah you poor patty Jenkins another beer because hot damn my friend,0.78405
you accomplished so many unseen goals beyond the ones that people already give you much,0.15773238
due credit for this success cannot be undersold actually here's how hard not to undersell,0.1055153
at 821 million dollars worldwide justice league is at 572 Justice League with six times,0.05656135
the superheroes including our titular hero undersell did it did it undersold it okay but,0.0794805
simply it is holy God everybody involved in this movie swung for the parking lot,0.10779313
how can we add modernity to this classic genre the first thing was meeting with,0.07793272
each of them and talking about okay here is the story that we are hunkering,0.10383344
in on telling on this the inspiration I've got to say of the design of,0.06886305
all of the armor and all of the world was the whisker I've tried to,0.057635672
grow it out of the Wonder Woman costume used in Batman vs Superman so taking,0.15581611
all the style lines taking all the information in that one costume inspired all of,0.096392386
the others so whether they're the Queen or whether they're a soldier there's a hint,0.081905045
of the Wonder Woman hostile in all of them like everybody very early on patty,0.31089434
and I talked about a portrait painter of the time of World War one John,0.11111842
Singer Sargent and he actually had we would consider a very modern approach to using,0.067127086
light in his portraits and a lot of that was very soft frontal three-quarter light,0.11022303
that quickly fell in the blackness beyond the character and that painting style sort of,0.0905025
dictated a lot of how I approach lighting the faces like everybody everybody there we,0.12681524
have them literally hundreds of designs for this before we got it we got it,0.08627665
down this with the chosen god killer the serpent has chosen for dinosaur the animal,0.40327245
was chosen just because of its look it's fierce it just gives off that vibe,0.14885175
that they want her to be that way it's a strong fierce god something in,0.11157719
the region of 38 locations across two countries because the UK nice thing that really,0.06500635
helped to me anchor how we would introduce different imagery into the shields or the,0.10296777
salt and we basically came up with the design that would go through each the,0.030438783
craftsmanship on everything you get the palpable and believable feeling that everyone working on this,0.110614456
believed they were working on something important and were they had the design thermos scan,0.069952674
Ferrara wait what is amiss the muscaria the mascara got it you know that first,0.13011916
try one take you know the place where the gods made their trial run civilization,0.13014238
also a world war one movie of grandeur and scope oh and it's a superhero,0.28328723
movie where alas those make people tell the truth made the lasso thing great what,0.111812495
the hell is this thing huh the Cloverfield episode add Superman in it and then,0.47762877
I did a Batman episode now a Wonder Woman episode that's like planning or something,0.07682099
also I just have a lot of things to say about DC superheroes and it,0.0673776
is a telling statement that I believe one of their main three houses is actually,0.042259693
in order I'm continually baffled by the scope of this thing here's an interesting thought,0.06301918
Wonder Woman is a world war 1 movie for I believe two reasons one it,0.26831862
puts Wonder Woman far enough away from the justice bro verse that you can sort,0.18461311
of avoid the flying bug monster pitfalls I mean Diana is actually fighting humans which,0.3045476
does make a difference if you came for the pun the punch fights or to,0.11699459
watch Diana knee this dude at a window - from an outside perspective World War,0.27027762
1 was the moment the world really started going down the path it is currently,0.053833697
on think about it what if you're an alien species that chooses to visit when,0.42620862
some large percentage of the world is embroiled in a thirty-two country conflict that claimed,0.12511581
the lives of some 17 million people which is really fertile soil to plant Diana's,0.11698045
roots in because here's a fun bit of trivia what other World War 1 movies,0.18507789
can you name I'll knock out a few there was Lawrence of Arabia a very,0.13488378
long engagement which I loved warhorse James Franco was in that movie you definitely forgot,0.2404601
about about fly boys yeah it can be slimmer pickins with that particular war which,0.24000408
i think makes the decision interesting it's period piece wrapped in a period piece and,0.14310777
I even talked about the movie yet I've just talked about the hoopla surrounding it,0.06021121
so let's get to [Applause] this movie is about a billion things that all add,0.055327572
up into one really beautiful new superhero thing and if you need to use the,0.08371066
restroom go now because this segment is the longest one I've ever done the show,0.07480849
last chance here we go the film opens in modern day immediately using Diana to,0.045072608
push us into a flashback explaining the birth of the Amazons also this elongated zoom,0.12259207
for meta earth level all the way to a shot that ends perfectly above the,0.24332668
Louvre pyramid is a super dope way to open her film so Bruce Wayne sends,0.27294356
Diana a photograph in the present day she has been searching for basically her entire,0.13154054
adult demigod life as it represents the moment she came alive as a being with,0.26777664
purpose and he uses his unlimited unearned well to track it down for her which,0.15291965
triggers a flashback of this entire story and is why we opened in Amazon on,0.10623743
a girl molded out of clay by her mother and breathed her life by Zeus,0.44533396
after her mother begged him to on an island filled with demigod women that is,0.451601
perpetually training for supposed to eminent war they never questioned the validity of which also,0.099021696
was against Ares the God of War but not that one also when Diana's mother,0.15235905
was surprised that her totally alone clay child was inspired by the militaristic display she,0.18039471
is inundated with 24/7 and was like oh no my daughter we live in a,0.117856264
society ruled by literally one purpose how ever has that purpose affected oh I might,0.09407923
faint fast-forward to Diana actually training because she's secretly a weapon called the god killer,0.47128037
spoilers a super subtle sounding superhero name that is in no way as cool as,0.07435817
Wonder Woman can she just go by that for a little bit um the god,0.36998308
the god killer one for me two things happen in rapid succession Diana realizes that,0.31089434
she is a weapon which brings up a whole host of new questions about agency,0.24106039
in a system that empowers people with a boatload of responsibility without their consent to,0.15217432
do so but that's more of a superhero problem at large from top to bottom,0.17439896
very much not specifically a wonder one problem so we're gonna table that one for,0.08593542
a second anyway this is where Steve Trevor and a whole host of German soldiers,0.24005078
come through this wormhole energy gotta energy shield thing and a big fight scene ensues,0.19585404
that takes a lot of lives between the bows and the guns and is our,0.20831533
first real visual clue that Diana isn't necessarily on board with any side of this,0.04537214
conflict diana is her own person something this movie is very much about as well,0.26041415
as its intended message empower each other speak truth to power which sometimes needs to,0.066557504
be spoken on the knuckles of perfect fists a point tough to argue in a,0.24730639
war film as her methods are downright civilized by comparison she fights for something not,0.14694987
against something let me tell you a story when I was finding out what I,0.075281225
wanted to say with this my friend Lili yes the same Lili friend from The,0.10451753
Iron Giant episode lose me and on this article here is everything about the meta,0.08774337
story of the movie and the point of this movie illustrated in a single story,0.05453708
and in a fun side note in tracking the story down as it appeared on,0.08564835
many websites who was originally run as a piece slash interview with patty Jenkins from,0.10793961
Fandango of all sites and it's about the no man's land scene you might be,0.0949375
saying to yourself hang on Michael isn't that the best scene in the movie yes,0.16858749
and it's entirely incidental to the central plot and I will remind you that the,0.1609548
central plot is irrelevant to this film killing Ares the God of War has no,0.3500584
effect on war still occurring the ultimate goal of this film has no purpose humans,0.24033748
are just bad the movie says all you can really do at the end of,0.19270602
the day is empower each other speak truth to power and stand up to the,0.064930834
injustice a--'s that you see in the world so when studio executives gave confused notes,0.104309
most likely pointing out that this serve no narrative purposes it was in no way,0.0677439
related to her core mission identifying kill Ares patty fought for it she said and,0.4032055
I am quoting this is a scene about her becoming Wonder Woman she isn't fighting,0.18695301
anyone Diana becomes Wonder Woman in a scene where she doesn't directly fight anyone it,0.15530191
was apparently a little confusing to shoot because everyone kept asking yes but who is,0.24127094
she fighting she becomes Wonder Woman when she isn't hitting people being a superhero doesn't,0.24684471
mean hitting people all the time bat man its narrative expendable but it's thematically irreplaceable,0.39801627
this scene in this movie moving on name an authority figure in this movie who,0.104629785
isn't wrong from archaic practices upheld with no thought into doing research to ensure that,0.052006755
the mascara could actually fend off an attack from the outside world and yes I,0.31089434
know that's getting into the weeds but even her mom isn't honest with her about,0.32414925
what her very purpose in life is and when she's helping the army out they,0.10449825
don't want to listen to her and also they superduper want a controller she puts,0.15416096
up with precisely none of these gender politics causing issues that Diana doesn't even care,0.22906354
to understand and Steve somehow manages to calm down her understandable displeasure with the world,0.19719508
by lassoing literally himself and that's a repeated theme throughout the movie is that her,0.13747051
friends are the ones who don't really try to control her that that much that,0.09922064
it's that they also do a little bit though it doesn't work that either and,0.086300135
if I may it has proven instantly the Diana as a person has a measurable,0.22481674
increase on the quality of life for literally the entire world and that's just by,0.13648245
existing in it your move Superman diana is lied to like a lot opiate because,0.28263
she has a higher given purpose but it is not a purpose anyone is honest,0.1063057
with her about so we get our first taste of the world war one back,0.17590083
story through flashback within flashback and that goes on like three or four times I,0.05595397
don't know I lost count which is all revealed to us in one of my,0.15341428
favorite scenes where Steve gets lasso of truth did again and asked to reveal literally,0.05501646
everything including what war the war the war dead end all wars which is the,0.20301917
break into Act two we are now getting a war film at the same time,0.10653281
as the superhero film as the superhero origin film you know after Diana steals all,0.08531486
the fun wonder weapons which were hers to begin with and even in banishment Diana's,0.117358305
mom does not tell her the truth still should have told her the more she,0.11685919
knows no sooner he'll find her cool that'll ensure everybody's did destruction though um anyway,0.16796406
Diana and Steve are now best friends because when you think about it Diana's never,0.073023364
really had a friend before and they're the two people most out of their elements,0.20264785
in this entire situation their bond makes in a sixth-grade kind of weird way but,0.16290306
warranted and earned and also they're in love sometimes but I mean and this is,0.05909515
where gal gadot - yes you say the T begins to absolutely shine like when,0.12477259
confronted with German baddies and Steve Trevor is like good fahadh me but then she,0.1949705
blocks a bullet and he's like or maybe not but the key to this scene,0.55277234
is in how the conflict is resolved without any further confrontation after making short work,0.06293756
of everyone that's armed and providing an imminent threat when the fight is over Diana,0.12898676
first apologizes to the man she just hurt and speaks compassion whereas Batman would have,0.09914434
that that basically this movie is a lot of people trying to tell Diana who,0.10151526
she is and what she can do and her not really taking too kindly to,0.11718476
their suggestions also defying Authority for altruistic reasons you know a super hero a little,0.07914051
bit power fantasy a little bit punk rock a little bit uplifting warm look at,0.40489712
why you do the right thing because we're all on the same team you would,0.07431798
knowingly sacrifice all those lives as if they mean less than yours this may mean,0.49122822
nothing it's a lot of things a billion in fact one way to describe it,0.060757533
would be to say that this film deals with PTSD more than the majority of,0.05914439
war films which is a telling statement and this film doesn't deal with it a,0.10250011
great deal but it does acknowledge it if even through the lens of a World,0.06066942
War 1 mindset and the PTSD side story ends with me ya know Charlie won't,0.28961563
sing for us this is why this movie is awesome details Diana paid attention to,0.09753732
in a world entirely confusing and new to her that no one else noticed because,0.102824405
Diana is kind compassionate and modeled not from clay but from human empathy wonder woman,0.18907794
sets an example not just to young girls and women though it was certainly judged,0.17225307
unfairly under that exact metrics she sets an example for all of the other superheroes,0.117821984
no I'm sure Batman is a good role model for young boys he just painfully,0.17789151
disfigures people to get them murdered in prison how is that Batman and that trait,0.5301457
is not solely Batman's which is when Diana accomplishes her mission and the movie gets,0.04218763
a little dark she's blindly still trusting the words of her people when so many,0.24191897
of them lied to her I mean she outright murders the man she thinks is,0.39717302
Ares and has no concept of why there is still war in the world she,0.2746404
was sold a simplified vision of it and we get the chewy nougat II centre,0.074830055
of this film my favorite Chris Pine performance ever yes even better than smoking aces,0.17415653
because it is just so honest maybe maybe we don't but it's not about that,0.06770958
it's about what you believe you don't think I get it after what I've seen,0.15064089
out there you don't think I wish I could tell you that it was one,0.13822174
bad guy to blame it's not believed in doing good things just to do them,0.25409427
Steve dies for this idea and this sacrifice connects Diana to exactly what he was,0.23806597
trying to say humans are bad a lot of them in fact so when I,0.31089434
say Wonder Woman is a movie about a billion things I mean it those billion,0.14364286
things all work and they work together and it leans in every direction it has,0.06065674
to to make it work it gets campy it gets silly it gets heavy it,0.4297842
does what it needs to because it's a billion great things here's why I think,0.07241073
what patty Jenkins and company managed to accomplish here is monumental it took an icon,0.103893
with a rich and wildly diverse back catalogue of quality and made a modern thing,0.14263642
with a modern message and it was one of peace and hope and acceptance and,0.050281458
yes love the kind of love you have for Humanity when you are sworn to,0.1495615
protect it and as you learn usually from itself because some people are bad but,0.32434598
even the unseen demonic God force admits he wasn't responsible for any of this some,0.36291212
people are just bad which is an ultimately myopic naive point that I wish all,0.69542736
superhero movies would make people are ultimately good and in the face of a lot,0.1421097
of current evidence to the contrary the majority of people are ultimately good something diana,0.09676798
takes on faith because one person she knew her best friend in fact was a,0.08549513
really good person I like it when my superhero movies actually attempt the good role,0.074240066
model thing and I don't mean that all superhero films have to be role models,0.073104374
just sharing my personal belief that given their young schooling audience it doesn't suck when,0.5880914
someone stands up for the good in humanity for giving our weaknesses and tries to,0.10846625
show us a better world and I know it's artfully rewarding to deconstruct the ideas,0.15534037
of superheroes at what seems like our apex of them but we also live in,0.08631301
a day and age where things are so polarized you actually don't necessarily want your,0.12887645
flagrant fictional escapism to remind you of the dour hopeless visit we struggle to hang,0.40336356
up over the crumbling old one frankly it isn't the time for Watchmen and wouldn't,0.093172625
you know it we trusted someone to make a deconstructive superhero film and I don't,0.077000916
want to be this negative but he hasn't shown a general aptitude for con strutting,0.24109909
them let alone deconstructing them you want to talk about hitting from the rough Patti,0.21682376
followed Batman V Superman dawn of Justice that's like making a Padme spin-off after episode,0.085359976
two they should be carrying petty jiggets off the field like Rudy after this so,0.18178721
here's a wild idea give Justice League to two patty Jenkins even if it's a,0.17279486
soft reboot to point yourselves in the right direction again like making Wonder Woman the,0.16989164
leader of the entire team this time because she's the only one that actually acts,0.1469
like a you know human like what if WB's DC movies were the ones that,0.31128353
actually had something to say about superhero films here's a bad thought when Captain Marvel,0.15292498
comes out it will be the twenty first film that Marvel Studios has released it,0.10589143
took them twenty-one movies to get to the point where they actually felt comfortable having,0.064960204
a woman anchor a solo film that's a lot 21 DC it took you for,0.1328851
three if you don't count Suicide Squad and I will grant you that Mulligan you,0.5792772
have an own an amazing blueprint a blueprint that a particular Wonder Woman fought against,0.15019585
you to make something that will ultimately define the genre in the moment we are,0.04284541
currently in your move yeah so this is the last episode of the year I,0.086167246
know last year I did a big end of 2016 spectacular or not really gonna,0.07819193
be happen in this year also quick thank you to Lily Tommy serenity and Logan,0.06615642
for helping me out on this episode we're gonna go into the patrons but I'm,0.094464414
gonna keep talking for a second this year got scary and was sad and was,0.11019579
really hard and I didn't enjoy it a lot but I hope you enjoyed some,0.1596189
of the more wild swings and tone I took on this show trying to find,0.09494531
you know something by the way I'm playing crowd noise because it's thought it would,0.08059278
be a fun thing to do where I'm just like yo what's up William Dixon,0.050640646
nice French onion dip like we're all at a party together Oh what's up the,0.08957556
Jen nice dance moves love it milli vanilli great shirt Nathan Goldberg I didn't know,0.11430294
you still ate cinnamon buns that is that a thing people do at parties or,0.21272796
no yeah anyway it was it was a really scary terrible horrible awful year and,0.34111518
