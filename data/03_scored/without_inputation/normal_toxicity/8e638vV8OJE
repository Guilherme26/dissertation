so I recently saw Roma by Alfonso Curran and it was pretty fantastic,0.13185738
I have a lot of respect for a big-budget Hollywood directors who've made big summer blockbusters,0.08765464
but who then made the decision to do something small-scale and less accessible as you can see in the clips that are being shown at the moment the cinematography for this film is breathtaking and the amount of detail that is put into every shot is nothing short of exceptional,0.12478553
and every shot in this movie is made with the utmost care and precision and no matter which point you look in the shot,0.2357201
there's always something going on to catch your eye there are shots that I have hundreds of extras all of which have something to do,0.17109129
and there are shots that go on for three to four minutes that would have taken hours to set up as well as some incredible shots done entirely with natural lighting at sunset with a window of time in which they can film is incredibly short the film's sound design is also packed with detail,0.06731488
there are,0.029904466
so many small background noises that give life to the setting and almost transport,0.039083205
you back to 1970s Mexico in fact I'm quite disappointed that it's had quite a short release in theaters because the use of spatial sound in this movie is brilliant,0.15220833
the acting was excellent from everybody including the kid actors who despite not being in the movie whole lot still felt incredibly incredibly real the tone that this film creates is incredible and the silence that at the start of the movie feels somewhat comforting in a way becomes haunting by the end of the movie there isn't a single weak aspect about this film,0.11065888
and I think when it comes out on Netflix you should all do yourself a favor and give it a watch and I'm going to give this film a 9 out of 10,0.39963457
though I might change it to a 10 up on rewatch,0.07230153
