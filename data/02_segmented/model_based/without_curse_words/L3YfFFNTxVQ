"You know, I had a dream that one day someone would actually make a film about Martin Luther King Jr"
"and handle it in a very truthful, accurate and respectful manner, And it looks like that dream has come true"
"Hey guys, the black corner guy today, I'm here to review the film Selma"
"Now, the film Selma takes place in a very tumultuous time in Us"
"history where segregation was alive and well in the South and it follows the demonstrations and peaceful protests by Martin Luther King, Jr"
and how he got it all together
"None of my knowledge and I could be wrong about this, but I don't think there has ever been a theatrical film made about Martin Luther King, Jr"
"Sure, there's been a lot of Tv movies, Tv specials, documentaries and miniseries about the man, but never a full-on theatrical film about Martin Luther King, And it could be because, with all of his contributions to the world and countless of good things he has done, to sum it all up in a two-hour long movie, I just wouldn't do the man any justice, so I guess nobody wanted to attack that"
"but seeing Selma, I think they really picked a very monumental time in Maher Luther King's life to show on the big screen"
And what I really appreciate about this film is that it does
It takes place after all the things that we really remember
"Maher Luther King, 4"
It takes place after his speech at Washington Dc
It takes place after he won his Nobel Peace Prize
"It takes place after all the major events that we've come to know about Martin Luther King, And it's like the events afterwards"
This takes place
"I believe in 1965 in Selma, Alabama and I really praised the movie for doing that"
They easily could have been like
This is the life of Martin Luther King
We're gonna go through all of it and we're gonna end on like the big speech
Though they actually address one key moment in Maher Luther King's life
Basically they pulled a Lincoln with this movie
"We're focused on one major event in the man's life and really showed it to us, and in my honest and humble opinion, I believe that this was the perfect time for a film like Selma to be released, especially after all the events that have occurred in the last few years, because people need to be reminded of the struggle of the trials and tribulations that the people face back in the 1950s and 60s"
"they need to be reminded of the people that sacrifice their lives to give us the rights that we have today, and people need to be inspired to make a change, and needless to say, I thought that someone was a great and fantastic film, and one that I truly respect in the fact that it doesn't really follow the same trend as other films that talk about the civil rights movement before it"
"I mean, Yes, they do shine a light on the civil rights movement and they do show it as a justification to it, And I found that so intriguing"
"I was hoping that this film could stand out amongst the other civil rights type films, and I think that it truly does, and it stands out for many reasons, the biggest one being its portrayal of the man that was Martin Luther King, Jr"
They do not put this guy on a pedestal
"They do not treat him as a God among men, as I've seen in Tv specials and heard in documentaries"
They show Dr
King for what he truly was
He was a man
he had faults
He had a lot of faults that were addressed in the film
He had doubts
There was a scene where he's in the jail cell
He's talking to one of the people that I can guessing is his friend and he's talking about
"You know, Is what we're doing really going to help? Is it really going to change? You know, we could get a man to sit down in a dining table, but he can't pay for the burger at the diner"
He had hesitations
This was same where he's standing on the bridge
He's wondering whether I should push forward or if he should just turn back
He was a man and I loved how the film humanized Dr
King
They in put him on a pedestal
"That is the most perfect representation of King I've seen in a movie thus far, and that is all attributed to the excellent performance done by this guy"
"I cannot pronounce his last name, and I would hate to butcher it, so I'll put his name right here, but I'm gonna call him David"
"Oh, this guy"
he did such a phenomenal job portraying Dr
"Martin Luther King, now at first scared because his voice didn't really capture the voice that was Martin Luther King, Jr's"
voice
"I've heard Martin Luther King's voice so many times I could tell it from a mile away, but when I heard his voice didn't really sound like him, and I was a little scared and hesitant to really see him as Martin Luther King, but as the film continued, I just got sucked into his performance, especially when he is preaching to the crowd"
I felt the presence of Martin Luther King right there
I could feel it radiating out of him
I hope he gets nominated
"I don't know if he'll win, but if he gets nominated, I'm gonna be so happy because his performance is truly Oscar worthy"
one of the best performances I've seen of the year
"Though riding in the film was excellent and I loved how they addressed all the struggles, all the pressure and all the conflict that Dr"
King had to face during the Selma protest
"You would think that a film called Selma would only focus on the town of Selma, and what Martin Luther King Jr"
"did in that town, but No, The film also addresses what he was dealing with meeting with the President in Washington, Dc, and trying to push the Voting Rights Act"
It shows his marital struggle to keep his marriage alive because there's a lot of issues going on right there
"I love that the film addressed this because I've heard about for years, but I always thought no one would ever see that port in film"
And they did
They addressed it in this film to actually put it on screen and gave it so much attention and focus
"I love that now, although I felt like the film's representation of the march and the brutality by the police was done very well and unfiltered"
I felt like they kind of withheld on showing a little bit more of the gruesomeness of that scene
I felt like it was probably more gruesome and more damaging than what we actually saw
"But for the scene that were there, they were brutal and they were really hard to watch"
It was just gut-wrenching to think that people would actually do like this and it did happen
And the sad part is it continues to happen
I was like the fact that they gave Dr
King a sense of humor
"I mean, there are some scenes where he's talking to his buddies and it just feels like a natural conversation and they're just joking around"
"I wish the more scenes like that, but of course it's all about the events that are going down, the struggles that he's facing, But it would have been nice to see more downtime that Dr"
King had with his friends
"I mean, those scenes were really well done"
It really captures the normal life that Dr
King sort of lived now and again
I guess the last thing I want to talk about and praise about this film was the acting
"I already praised David Ohs, performance of Dr"
"King, but everybody else also did a really good job"
and there's just so many notable performances like
"I thought, Tom Wilkinson did a really good job at portraying Lyndon B"
Johnson
I felt like he captured him perfectly
Overall
"guys, I love this film"
This film really touched me
It really spoke to me
This is probably one of the best films about the civil rights movement
I probably have ever seen it
If I had seen it in 2014
it definitely would have been in my top ten of the year and it would have been number one
That's how great it was
All the performances were solid
they were genuine
Everything about this film I just felt like clicked and I could not take my eyes off the screen
"I was in trans by the story at the events that were occurring on screen, and the performances that each and every actor and actress in this film gave it is an amazing and phenomenal film and I really hope that you guys go and check it out, because it is getting the highest grade it could ever get on this channel"
"That's the 5 out of 5, but it's not an epic masterpiece"
It's just a masterpiece
It's an excellent work of film and I just loved it
"and in recommending films that are very similar to Summer, you guys should definitely check out Malcolm X, starring Denzel Washington as the militant leader"
He does a really good job at conveying and capturing the man that was Malcolm X
"In fact, he earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal"
That's how good it was
"I would also recommend that you check out Lincoln, which also has a very similar set up, And then it takes place in a very crucial moment in this very important person's life"
"But anyway, I would truly love to know what you guys thought about this film"
If you have seen it
"Did you love it as much as I did? Did you feel like it was a mask? Peace in an excellent film, or did it just not live up to what you were hoping? And he felt like it was emotionally manipulative and totally bias"
And let me know who is your favorite social activists? Somebody that fights injustice in the world
"Comment below, Let me know, and I know"
"I took this review a little bit more seriously, But the film called for a series of you and that's exactly what I did"
