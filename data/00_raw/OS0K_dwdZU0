before we get started let me just tell you I get it I'm a [ __ ] weirdo I'll tell you why I said that a little later but just now know that I know Dunkirk so Dunkirk is the new Christopher Nolan film this one is based on a true story I don't know how true it is to the people concentrates on for the majority of the movie but the situation will circumstance in Dunkirk among world war two that happened basically there are a bunch of soldiers stranded on a beach the enemy is closing in they have nowhere to go they need off the beach they just they got nowhere to go there's an ocean there that tends to make for trouble the Germans are bombing the boats they're bombing them looks pretty bleak for these guys talking about what I liked in the movie first of all the movie is gorgeous looking I saw it in IMAX so it does that thing where when in action scenes going down or a really important scene boo just blows out in IMAX and the movie has some scenes of intensity granted a lot of the intensity revolves around people possibly drowning once you see it a couple times you're like I got it people almost drowned oh look at that another person is about to drown and the sound when the guns are go the first time you hear a gun go off you're like yeah that sounds like a gunshot it might have been this speaker system of theater I saw it in but whenever a gun was going off those planes were coming in it does that that sound effect you know just your the like dragons in there the scary stuff and it does make you feel like you are there it's not like a glorified action spectacle this movie's a very realistic the fighting is over we're doing the fish in the barrel thing but the fighting is others it's not like the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan however as much as the movie was visually remarkable because the movie doesn't really have character it has people people in peril people are in this movie characters oh no not really I cannot tell you a name of a person in this movie I'm pretty sure they address the name just a lot of average-looking white dudes with dark hair there's a blonde dude though so what a lot of scenes I'm like are you the same guys that I don't I think you might be not a lot of talking in this movie that wouldn't be a problem and granted not a lot of dialogue does force you to look at other elements in the movie versus you to use your ears for your surroundings use your eyes more I totally get that that's an interesting direction to take a movie however more dialogue would allow you to tell me more about the characters and why I should give a [ __ ] that I don't give a [ __ ] about the situation the situation being based on a true story however this true story is wrapped up it's in a box called a movie at that point you need characters to grab onto and I just didn't onto any of these characters said know nothing about them they have wives at home I don't know they have a girlfriend did they have brothers no idea are they serial killers they [ __ ] could be I couldn't tell you that I have no idea I don't know about anyone in this movie so I can't grab on because I don't know what we're fighting for her life living yeah that's easy to say but you need to let me know what life this person is going to lose out on if they don't make it through the situation does the movie will hop over it's like whoa it was daytime a second ago now it's night now it's day again granted day is followed by night which is followed by day and then you're like I feel like I've seen this scene before he's doing the thing where it's showing me the same situation through someone else's eyes so I'm effectively seen the same thing twice two or three times but in a world where all these ships look the same it's not always clear that you see in the same thing because the editing the movie was kind of messy and as I said the movie is a very realistic take of survival in a war situation that's my way of saying the movies pretty boring as intense as the intense scenes that were supposed to be intense were intense when the intensity was going down oh sure the movie is not that most of the movie is things are progressing forward with very little dialogue and as realistic as you could say that is that's like someone making a police movie like a cop movie the most realistic cop movie ever and we're supposed to like it because it's realistic even if it's 90% paperwork in the precinct because that is most of what a cops life is that would be pretty [ __ ] boring realistic doesn't necessarily make good that all depends on why you go for movies it all depends on why you're going to this movie and as much as I and I'm very sure every review and review were is going to say the movie looks great that's not enough for me and it's never been enough for me to say a movie looks great a great looking movie doesn't make for a good movie that's like saying I have the greatest girlfriend ever because she looks great yeah but what else the link would tell me about her tell me about her past her hopes her dreams what's in there if I can't tell you that means I have a pretty boring girlfriend guys in the end this is one of those moments we have to understand why we are here and we have to be okay with that are you here to hear me validate your opinion on a movie or at least validate what you hope a movie is going to be or are you here to hear my honest opinion on the movie and am I here to see validation in the comments section or am I here to give you my honest opinion on a movie hopefully it's the honest opinion one because that's all I can give you and that's what this is it Dunkirk looked great had some scenes of intensity that I enjoyed Mark Rylance completely stands out in the movie he's the one I actually was you kind of have a story but in the end the movie was slow it was very ambitious but very unfocused that's why in the beginning of this video I said I get it I'm a [ __ ] weirdo because apparently I'm supposed to love this movie and when you're a small movie reviewer in 2009 starting out on YouTube people tend to like it when you go against Rotten Tomatoes and go against the credit but wouldn't you get a bit of a following it starts to piss people off so we'll see what happens alright guys so Dunkirk have you seen it what did you think about it whatever he's about comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
