hey everyone it's Mariana and let's talk about Logan this is supposedly Hugh Jackman's last,0.08624002
appearance as Wolverine and it's also a pretty different approach to an x-men character on,0.061892375
film it's rated R is gritty it's dark and it's generally pretty grim and we,0.15379174
knew this was going to be different because of what we've seen in the trailers,0.06029608
but even after the trailers I still thought this movie was darker and more depressing,0.15469652
than I anticipated the movie focuses on this old and tired Wolverine he still has,0.14383717
his powers he can still rip people to shreds if she needs to but it's,0.402119
not quite as easy as it used to be and life has definitely taken a,0.080135025
toll on him he is trying to take care of Professor X who is not,0.13475409
doing well either and ends up being responsible for a young mutant girl who is,0.33254665
being pursued by some bad people first of all it is so refreshing to see,0.17063202
a superhero film that is a smaller personal kind of story that focuses on character,0.06299962
and personal struggles rather than trying to go for the typical world and peril type,0.08396877
of plot now I'm not saying that all superhero movies need to be like this,0.09844304
and nothing that at all I love seeing superheroes work together and have fun with,0.06776817
their powers and I think it would be a huge bummer if all superhero movies,0.52053976
turned into these gritty dramas with heroes having personal crises but we've seen so many,0.10844299
comic book movies where the stakes are just huge and saving the world is the,0.08442071
focal point that smaller stories like this that just focus on the few characters are,0.04981607
a good change of pace and the R rating really helps with that as well,0.035022337
because it adds a layer of realism not just to the violence because obviously it,0.16158696
adds realism to the violence compared to pg-13 violence but also thematically Logan is a,0.1140041
pretty adult in serious film a big part of it is talking about how violence,0.2281465
has consequences and it's not just fun superhero time taking out the bad guys they,0.12566781
keep coming back to this theme in the movie and there's even a moment which,0.10704572
you may remember from the trailer where Logan picks up an x-men comic book and,0.0670552
says nothing happened like this in real life people die it is a bit ironic,0.5876557
that even though this is one of the main messages of the film we still,0.05215292
go to see it for entertainment and I've seen people say things on social media,0.09042986
along the lines of Logan was so much fun and the r-rated violence was so,0.1938631
cool and the whole point of the film is that violence and death is not,0.14569086
cool even if you're chilling the bad guys it still takes a toll on you,0.27522528
so it's a bit of a weird dynamic there I personally thought that they went,0.1692562
a little bit too far with the grittiness and the darkness of the whole thing,0.077088684
that's just a personal preference of mine because it is a really long movie and,0.05862327
I felt kind of emotionally tired after it it was 2 hours and 20 minutes,0.14323783
of Logan being old and depressed and everything hurts for him and everything is difficult,0.14260319
and professor X is senile and things are generally bad if there are a few,0.30588278
moments of humor but overall this film is kind of a downer because I like,0.06994928
Wolverine and it really is freaking sad to see him like this so a little,0.48586166
bit too long and a little bit too depressing for my taste just taking everything,0.50967616
into account however Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are just at their best here they,0.066934705
had something to work with as far as character depth they had a lot of,0.046954606
great back-and-forth I loved the two of them in this movie and of course this,0.13019389
would not work if they didn't nail the casting of Laura aka x-23 because she's,0.1111815
a very important part of the story and Daphne Keane is excellent she has so,0.051515702
much energy she's definitely a strong presence and she was the perfect kid to cast,0.13541003
here the villains were okay as characters Boyd Holbrook stood out in particular because he,0.1587617
was pretty charismatic but generally they didn't get much backstory or development and on that,0.07591239
note we really didn't get much explanation as far as how we got from 2023,0.039523296
which is the ending of Days of Future past and everything seems pretty great -,0.08001685
just six years later it's 2029 and here we are with Logan everything just sucks,0.76945966
and you know it's not good I felt like in the movie that was this,0.10306975
long they could have found a way to explore that a little bit more and,0.08845177
I did wish there was more of an explanation as to what happened because it,0.040439975
hasn't been that long since everything was fine but I guess that's just not the,0.04980378
story they wanted to tell in this movie overall Logan is absolutely worth watching if,0.06984686
you're a fan of x-men if you're a fan of Hugh Jackman is Wolverine it,0.34818536
is a different personal more dramatic take on an aging superhero I hesitate to say,0.083951384
that I enjoyed it it's just not the right word for this movie experience I,0.089010924
really felt for the character and a lot of the film was heartbreaking because you,0.031188646
care for the character and it is a really good film superhero or not so,0.054532595
I'm going to be giving Logan a solid 4 out of 5 stars it is,0.06493694
easily obviously the best out of the standalone Wolverine movies and it is definitely one,0.10107779
of the best x-men movies in general that's it for my review of Logan let,0.14231431
me know what you guys thought of this movie in the comments below if you've,0.14672033
seen it already let me know how it ranks within the general x-men franchise and,0.06883345
let me know if any of you felt like I did and thought it was,0.07571433
a little bit too dark just a little bit but kind of still enjoyed the,0.3222462
whole idea of having a dark dramatic superhero movie I'm very conflicted as you can,0.12047588
