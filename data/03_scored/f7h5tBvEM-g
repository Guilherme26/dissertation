the voice actor was Nicolas Cage as this guy which was just really funny then,0.13472113
we have Liev Schreiber as the kingpin now the kingpin is my one negative in,0.16123222
this movie I really did not like the portrayal of the kingpin and I really,0.1067467
didn't dig the voice choice it sounded too much of like an Italian mafia boss,0.22735617
whereas I don't really see the kingpin that way per se also I did not,0.07528115
like the way the kingpin was drawn he's so out of proportion to what a,0.11126034
normal human looks like which I guess the kingpin kind of does look like that,0.31089434
normally but I really did not dig that and the kingpin also seemed a little,0.042533867
bit too powerful in this movie when he's fighting spider-man and I also wasn't really,0.12068294
digging the kingpins motivations for everything and a lot of that in this film this,0.1487436
movie is just really fun is really great seeing the origin story from Miles Morales,0.0538827
and seeing his interaction with his parents and we throw all these alternate spider people,0.3523067
in here and Gwen Stacy's Alice story was pretty interesting then we have these two,0.05745658
Peter Parker's and I just want movies on all these different spider people thrown into,0.26129833
the mix now I would have been fine if we just left it at that,0.0695829
for the spider people once we throw in the spider-man Noire and the spider ham,0.14705144
and then there was this Japanese Spider Girl which it has this robot and maybe,0.15044032
that was a little bit too much but I mean it's still really fun throwing,0.24230751
them into the mix overall I really liked this movie my only negatives are the,0.15165262
kingpin and as well as maybe was a little bit too jokey at times but,0.29533857
