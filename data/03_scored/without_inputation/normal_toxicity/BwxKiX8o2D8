this is relatability,0.06085392

third,0.035246834
this screenplay is an excellent example of show rather than tell you the cinematography of this film was meant to feel like a series of photographs capturing memories from her gross childhood take a screen grab from nearly anywhere in the film and it could go right in your photo album this film had a very simple style of cinematography,0.06742992
and I think it fit very well with the story the story was about real life,0.070756406
and the cinematography felt like it the whole film was shot on a tripod and dolly with one hand held shot and no Steadicam which i think is pretty interesting for a film shot in the 21st century,0.09899504
when there's so much big cinematic movement also to note the focal lengths all seem very normal,0.087263554
there wasn't anything extremely wide or extremely telephoto,0.09578515
this gave the film a really human feel,0.17988421
now think about what this movie might have looked like if Michael Bay,0.08730424
I'm not going to punish you,0.66221654
oh why not it was a sister cheetah,0.17922795
and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were talking really to be fair,0.11892975
I wasn't just married to Jesus it's been 40 years,0.09586849
well he's a lucky guy,0.07146309
so after looking in the film here's my take on the style of Lady Bird,0.10870503
hey how's it going what you're doing you're so annoying,0.63572574
do you want I just want to talk to you,0.091833934
what do you want,0.0666203
I just want to talk to you,0.08778374
you,0.10154687
don't ever just want to talk,0.08257488
what do you want you never talked to me,0.31089434
all I want is for us to communicate,0.112224445
the only communicating you do is between you and your cereal,0.19774802
yeah it's seriously good,0.075471126
you know what I'm done have fun with your cereal,0.2556112
oh wait it's mine I'd pay for that,0.10511239
so with this shot I basically want to see how well I could replicate the dynamic range basically had a few options,0.0742794
blows off number one I could have raised the ambient light in the room to match that of the outdoors with my prosumer lights and the high ceilings,0.15067443
this wasn't really an option a second,0.06449999
I could have decreased the life in the window,0.28114977
I could have done this with sheets of nd,0.14371529
now I didn't have an in hand but we've used this in the past on other productions and it's been pretty effective,0.0596287
my guess on how big did this one set was by pushing some extra light into the ceiling and then adding flags in the foreground to keep the light off the actors,0.068645075
my impromptu solution was cutting the light slightly but the shears and then allowing the window to be overexposed by a stop or two afterwards I realized I could have taken the exposure down on all three shots because the foreground and the original scene is actually pretty dark,0.14870249
second,0.053916644
I wanted to duplicate how a lot of the dialogue scenes were shot in this film first a wide 50/50 and then two over the shoulder shots third was the color grade,0.08954033
here's the shot before new color grading,0.1536752
first,0.04585904
I took her still from the movie scene and then I dropped into my timeline in the color panel I went down to the color wheels and matched tab I clicked on comparison view and that's at the comparison to the frame from the video,0.08554454
I wanted to match next I clicked apply match and waited for it to analyze make any adjustments,0.072570466
you want from there,0.062458593
finally I jumped over to the effects window and edit effect noise at 3% strength to make the footage look like it could have been shot on film,0.13756473
and that's it good good it's serious,0.04961762
yeah it's seriously good,0.07547115
