a quiet place was directed by John Krasinski and stars him and Emily Blunt and,0.0871504
some terrific young actors who play a family trapped in a world that's been overrun,0.24229422
by monsters they're easily susceptible to sound with the slightest noise drawing them in we,0.3479099
spent 95 tense minutes watching this family struggle to stay completely silent this is a,0.08818935
nerve shredding thriller tense from the opening scene to the very end Krasinski proves himself,0.14963086
to be a more than capable director maximizing the suspense by choosing what he focuses,0.05439362
on when he reveals things to the audience versus when he reveals them to the,0.04306976
characters really effects the suspense level the scenes with the creatures are rarely about the,0.07742889
creatures they're about the characters this isn't just a monster movie it's a movie about,0.29646397
people and there happens to be monsters lurking around outside like all of the best,0.3109277
ones it focuses on the characters and it's about one family struggling to survive it's,0.03850519
sort of like an odd combination of tremors and 10 Cloverfield Lane the best of,0.083211966
both of those movies it benefits from a talented cast and one concept taken to,0.05094488
its extremes from the opening scene the stakes are established and the threat is very,0.089104995
real it's clear that even the slightest sound could result in death whereas in some,0.31444183
films like the aforementioned tremors if you create noises on the ground or they hear,0.10894298
you based off the vibrations of you running they might come after you you could,0.15404786
still maybe escape and a quiet place if you make a noise you're probably dead,0.49485707
like instantaneously and so there's this considerable level of fear throughout every scene as these,0.11938826
characters use sign language body language and facial expressions so that we understand the story,0.07691328
and even the subtle character nuances without needing words and since there is such limited,0.15431881
dialogue to tell a story like this a filmmaker has to know how to communicate,0.10817139
to the audience without saying much Krasinski and his actors excel at this since the,0.1052325
characters are forced to live in this world they have to change their way of,0.07464927
life which leads to one of my favorite aspects of this film watching their new,0.078291
way of living instead of using plates they might use a lettuce leaf they with,0.1757112
their hands instead of utensils they will play a board game but they use pieces,0.09784034
of instead of metal pieces for the most part they make valid choices often in,0.088505656
horror films we find ourselves angry with the people on screen baffled by the idiotic,0.9024877
decisions they make but here everyone seems to have a pretty good head on their,0.15633008
shoulders having constructed a complex system around their farm that helps warn each other if,0.07079202
something's wrong that being said this is a film that could only exist specifically in,0.09511839
this time period it's set in because from the very beginning we're told that it's,0.040694576
day 89 indicating that it's 89 days into whatever started this current predicament with these,0.062042017
monsters on earth and so they already have a system in place they've already figured,0.50988156
out some things we're not seeing the mass hysteria of day one we're seeing how,0.08147515
one family has learned to survive it would be a drastically different film had it,0.06611862
been on day one having it be later into the event whatever that event is,0.064304285
we now can see a family that's constructed a system that works which makes you,0.049493644
appreciate these characters more because they're actually smart for the most part admit at least,0.11484229
some characters do make some odd choices there's some confusion and unanswered questions for one,0.033902656
thing it's never explained how they still have electricity if it's a generator I don't,0.07764216
remember ever seeing one on top of that it would make a lot of noise,0.0836472
if they ever had to restart the generator and so there are nitpicks there are,0.091512695
some unanswered questions similar to the film's signs this is a film about one family,0.041221127
and we only learn what they learn we don't know much from the outside the,0.108747035
characters sometimes go up to this big mill they have and they light a fire,0.32664588
and you can see that in the distance there are other people who also have,0.049883466
fires so it's not like they're the only people left but they can't really go,0.25133163
into the world that much due to the fact that they have to make no,0.076028645
sounds otherwise these things are going to come out of the bushes and kill them,0.8785311
and so the fact that it takes place later in the timeline of whenever this,0.07707417
event occurred it gives this specific story some credibility because we are to assume that,0.06288144
they have discovered some things or figured some things out you could nitpick here and,0.09228395
there with ideas about how to kill the monsters that these characters aren't using but,0.36449027
many of those ideas assume that this family has endless supplies access to military weaponry,0.11071199
and things like that and if you start to overanalyze this film I think you're,0.116460145
missing the point this is a suspense driven thriller with some really good scares terrific,0.10733978
performances across the board Krasinski really does a lot of great things on the screen,0.07966761
and this is probably because as a director he knows exactly what this film needs,0.058540333
whenever a director and actor make the same project you can really tell that they,0.06602471
understand everything about it from beginning to end and Krasinski knows exactly what the film,0.07025474
needs for heightened power and tension Emily Blunt is amazing as well and they have,0.12816471
great chemistry as they are a couple in real life and the young kids do,0.083254755
a great job too especially since the daughter they have is deaf in the film,0.17453796
as well as real life so that's a very authentic performance that I'm sure she,0.15010132
understood and had a lot to bring to it while I always didn't necessarily find,0.038172293
myself wrapped up in the family's lives I was always interested to see what they,0.062191196
were going to do and what decisions they would make and by the end I,0.057996795
did find myself caring this is a good old-fashioned thrill ride if you've been missing,0.15219659
that at the movies and better yet if you need restored faith and mainstream horror,0.113762274
I think a quiet place can do that for you I'm gonna give it an,0.071539305
A - this is a simple and to the point thriller that doesn't try to,0.06909741
be anything else than what it is and it knows that and it's all the,0.08451793
better for that so I ready to play one review I promised that I would,0.074274845
talk to some of you guys about their reactions that you sent me for a,0.09146005
quiet place your anticipation for it if you had seen it and I'm gonna share,0.20260808
some of those reactions with you guys as I promised and hopefully be able to,0.083392575
interact with you more through that app hello Chris I am super excited because Emily,0.1357384
and John are married in real life and I'm sure they're gonna use that chemistry,0.09073083
and that love for each other to make their performances stand out and be more,0.1711294
powerful they did the chemistry seemed extremely real as I mentioned in the review it,0.032711357
was very strong this feels like like what it comes at night was last year,0.08170184
kind of creeping up on you and it looks really good I hope it is,0.45017937
especially with John Krasinski directing that's exciting even my girlfriend's excited just because she likes,0.19250081
them well I'm glad your girlfriend's excited for the film and I hope you guys,0.18000035
have a good time seeing it there are similarities I guess in the tension level,0.06377961
between it comes the night and a quiet place but they are two vastly different,0.094144545
films I say it's like which meets the last of us just that tight anxiety,0.15457335
of this trailer just gets me and you know I'm saying to be able to,0.072544605
edge of my seating that theater and what the nlgger is that kid doing with,0.35783318
that loud ass toy I don't know I can't wait for this movie I think,0.9017428
it's gonna be dope yes the kid the kid does make some not great choices,0.18171085
and that's that's what I alluded to in the review there are a couple times,0.05544908
where you're like no this this is day 89 like you know not to turn,0.1955234
on an electronic rocketship right now that was one of the choices that I think,0.085433714
maybe could have been written better but it's also a choice that needs to happen,0.057467867
for the rest of the film to make sense I gotta tell you I'm more,0.052721113
nervous than I am excited about this theater experience you've put out videos about awful,0.40325254
movie theater experiences this has the potential to be an all-time stinker if all it,0.6099746
takes is one idiot in the crowd to start mouthing off during the actual quiet,0.9328609
part of the quiet place hold it out hope for the most part my showing,0.09553226
was pretty good there was someone who did bring an infant and there were specific,0.19709449
times where Emily Blunt or John Krasinski would be like and in the background I,0.09672204
hear that was about it though it was it was alright it looks like a,0.06106362
very dense experience and the fact that it's adapted by John Krasinski is actually very,0.07843491
intriguing to me so yeah I'm very excited for that one it is indeed sense,0.10133762
and Krasinski does a great job this is his third film directing some people are,0.11891644
reporting that it's his first it's not true this is his third directorial effort and,0.06645253
I am very excited to see what he does apparently comedians turning to directing mainstream,0.11941693
horror Jordan Peele and now John Krasinski is like the new thing I'm all for,0.15222737
it I don't usually watch that many horror films in movie theatres because I hate,0.31102413
jump scares but I'm gonna go for this one it's a film that's very silent,0.13419025
and there are monsters so obviously there are going to be some jump scares but,0.35504907
they didn't feel cheap there were a few that were false and I was kind,0.12835301
of like really a raccoon and I rolled my eyes at that but for the,0.12717183
most part it's actually pretty clever stuff I mean I loved Emily Blunt and John,0.11726492
Krasinski but I'm always wary of such movies the premise is good but the delivery,0.0728289
is not always on point so let's just keep our fingers crossed and see how,0.05364896
the final product comes out and I just say sir you have an amazing voice,0.11627384
that is one of the most soothing voices I have heard in a long time,0.0740915
like I was actually listening to that reaction and I was just kind of like,0.053596478
getting really relaxed yes they are both great in the film as I've said I,0.04528584
hope you enjoy it when you see it as once quoted from our beloved HP,0.17255409
Lovecraft himself the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and,0.089251995
strongest kind of fear is the fear of the unknown okay I'm just kidding aside,0.11045712
from that I am really looking forward to watching horror films and I'm usually very,0.11149512
picky with horror films but I love it because it shows scaring people with silence,0.31089434
and tension that was frightening but I liked it a lot I watched it like,0.09130525
