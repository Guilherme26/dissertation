What's going on? Everybody jeered here with another good ol movie review
"Now if you're new to this channel, don't forget to hit that subscribe button because it seriously helps me out so so much"
"and it keeps you guys up to date on this channels newest content every single week, so I went out to the local art house theater to see one of these smaller indie movies that was giving a lot of buzz from other critics"
"The Farewell, Billy's family returns to China under the guise of a fake wedding to stealthily say goodbye to their beloved matriarch"
The only person that doesn't know she only has a few weeks to live
So is this smaller flick one of 2019 must-see Let's find out
"but before I get into my thoughts, let me know what you guys thought of the farewell, and if you thought this was as delightful as I did now, let's get into some of the good"
So the farewell
I had been hearing a lot of buzz from other critics
"Obviously, one of my good buddy said that this was a great movie to go check out, and I gotta say I could not be happier to have went out of my way to the local art house theater across town and check this one out"
This movie
"If I had to give one word to the farewell, it would be delightful"
"Director Lulu Wang, and the cast and everyone involved took this based on a true life story, and framed it in such a positive manner, because looking from the outside in this is a heartbreaking story"
"You know, the through line"
"It's gonna be grief and sadness, and I'm not gonna deny"
"those aspects are here in the farewell, But the way that they frame everything and the way that it's structured, it's more of kind of joy and happiness and celebrating someone's life, then focusing on the bad"
"And that's what I think I just loved about the farewell was that they kind of put this positive spin on everything rather than you know, dark dreary, the End of Days type thing"
And I think that that's why I thoroughly enjoyed the farewell because it exposed us to traditions and cultures that personally I'm not too familiar with
"We don't see them on the big screen that much, and it felt like a refreshing watch from the family dinners and discussions to the wedding ceremony, and then obviously at the core of this movie, the the way that the Chinese people handle cancer, you know, instead of letting the person know, they kind of let the whole family know"
don't tell that person so then they can continue living essentially a normal life like nothing is dragging them down Because they think that the idea of cancer is what actually kills you rather than the cancer
"Maybe I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially the lesson or the theme in this farewell movie and I'm sure you're probably thinking"
"I mean, personally, I even thought it's a little bit dumb"
but you know it works
and the way that I mentioned that it's kind of this light-hearted fun manner is because you can only imagine the shenanigans the lies what they have to do to keep the charade going
"So this gram of theirs, they're their agent"
"Grandma does not understand or figure out what's going on, And it is like I said, A lot of the humor is derived from this stuff, along with the performances and the family aspect at the middle of it again"
I didn't think I was gonna be laughing out loud
"I got more joy than sadness from this movie Because the way everything again, the way everything was structured"
"You know, the performances all the way from Aquafina to Han Xin, I think it is each of them turns in a solid performance and I entirely buy into this family dynamic because you know they're sitting there having dinner"
"You know, each of them are kind of laughing bickering"
"Know, maybe mean a little sarcastic here or there, And there are also the two dads who are brothers who hadn't seen each other in years"
They get back together
"It doesn't seem like a day has passed and that's why the farewell worked so well for me, Because it's not just this one aspect, you know, this aging person that's dying from cancer"
It's sort of this family drama also making myself think about my family like I don't know how long some people in my family have
I haven't seen an extended family for years
I need to get together
Sit down
Just have a big dinner and start to
"I guess, enjoy or cherish or celebrate someone's life again"
I thought the farewell was absolutely delightful
I found a very few negatives about this movie
I thoroughly enjoyed
It Would recommend it to anyone
There's maybe one or two three to five second shots that didn't entirely line up
"Maybe I was missing something, but that was the only negative I found here"
"Overall, I was completely blown away by the joy that The Farewell brought to the table from the beautiful story to the performances to the humor and light-hearted tone, and again, this family dynamic, and also making really think about things"
I cannot recommend the Farewell hire Like you need to go see this movie
"It's a smaller indie, but there's something special there and again"
It's based on a true lie like it's insane in closing
I'm gonna give the farewell 4
