I mean honestly just think about this would you prefer that I forget your name and just kind of out of respect don't say it or would you,0.08101046

he meets him in the land of the dead I I honestly thought he was just gonna be one of those annoying tag-along characters but no no his character actually surprisingly had more layers than than I was expecting all of the characters in this movie the characters that make up his family the characters that he meets when he's in the land of the day everybody is just I want to see more of these characters,0.10948377
I wouldn't mind seeing if Coco - hey you know what this movie has this movie has some really important and surprisingly complex and thought-provoking messages about the importance of family about the impact of music about the impact of your history a lot of important themes about following your dreams and the cost that dreams can have on you personally as well as the people that are following you the people that are closest to,0.075955294
you I feel like all of that was done in a surprisingly thoughtful and still emotion,0.1351276

you don't really care,0.23964351
you don't really know too much about the other rules of this world and you would have liked to have seen that expanded upon,0.09139925
