I feel like the Hollywood thing going forward is gonna be alright we're gonna take,0.05764889
an actor who's known generally for comedic things so John Krasinski has stepped out of,0.12193585
it since the office but he's more or less known for the office we'll have,0.06454683
them direct a thriller because apparently it really works a quiet place so what quiet,0.26357806
place is directed by John Krasinski he also gets writing credit on the movie along,0.08198946
with a couple of other people and it more or less revolves around this family,0.106709875
in this house in the middle of what looks like a farm and for a,0.09540923
while now they have dealt with this situation the situation being is kind of a,0.07441506
post-apocalyptic scenario you don't see much outside the farm so you don't really know how,0.08160633
the rest of the world is dealing with it I can't glance at all the,0.075565904
newspaper clippings I saw somewhat get the gist just being there are these aliens in,0.1544488
the world really feral aliens and if you make a sound they are drawn to,0.28626212
sound if they hear you they will scamper over to you and tear you apart,0.39537698
they'll shred you lose this family trying to sneak around going about their day-to-day not,0.27128446
making sound those sounds probably will happen and we've now set the stage for a,0.034223244
very effective thriller call it a thriller I know some people like I don't like,0.089369275
horror movies not as much a horror movie as it is a thriller a very,0.15272814
fine line between thriller and horror movie I feel like this movie really walks at,0.10996331
well everyone in this movies great John Krasinski and Emily Blunt there's a scene in,0.080520615
particular where I'm like emily Blunt's crushing it right now I even have a couple,0.17684646
of kids in the movie sometimes that is just your day away at that point,0.099014886
not these kids these kids are great I'm kind of doing a flyby talking about,0.24432455
oh they were all good in the movie but really they're great in the sense,0.092232674
that one very huge part of communication is generally speaking gone in his movies everything,0.10620384
they have to do they have to convey without words all the fear all the,0.07586255
intensity any of the emotions their face their body language these are the tools because,0.15545043
their voices just can't happen they can't talk they do they do sign language in,0.09062656
the movie that's the primary form of communication but let me just say that this,0.066168636
is a thriller based on life and death in which the most intense of conversations,0.30094633
are conveyed through sign language and it completely works that's not very conventional they'll do,0.06018787
a fantastic job operating in this world this movie has brought you into immediately this,0.15070817
movie brings you in on this world where you as the audience you feel like,0.0949169
you can barely breathe you definitely can't make any sounds there were these people behind,0.2836375
me they were talking as the movie was starting I was like oh my god,0.09086844
a few times no immediately you get that feeling of oh we can't make sounds,0.097793035
and the theaters shut up even people who cough they were like oh my god,0.6364068
nope you die not quiet enough it's quite a thing when you can make the,0.69542736
audience really feel like they're in the movie to the point where it's like making,0.07886172
any sounds whatsoever people are critical in their rappers to get their candy like and,0.10833795
it doesn't so effectively because it illustrates how easy it is to make sound as,0.063075066
homo sapiens are not stealthy the human race we're loud we're clunky we're not quiet,0.48835766
that's why stealth is a skill that you have to faster I drop a little,0.08736408
knickknacks and things all the time but if you do that in this world you,0.47466046
die a big thing this movie illustrates it's how adaptable people are you will adapt,0.62516177
to survive in most situations and if you don't adapt good news you get to,0.066896826
die early so you can see how they get food you get to see their,0.5154597
operations it makes the world feel very lived in a movie like this or any,0.07208377
apocalyptic type setting when it revolves around a family or a group of people and,0.15210505
they don't really show how will they be survived if I allow myself to pick,0.081146866
it apart I have to ask the question like how have you survived this long,0.098411135
this movie shows how they've survived this long it shows they do have a system,0.08868654
doesn't mean this movie doesn't drag on in part so for my first watch I,0.047585994
was still glued I was like it shows the world I really this movie makes,0.075506926
you reflect on human beings in general how much we rely on noise for communication,0.18264753
for a release I don't know how this movie got conjured up but the fact,0.0846767
that they're in a very intense scenario I almost feel like someone was in a,0.060332257
very intense scenario and they just had to release it had to scream they had,0.07013857
to have a big cry and they thought what if you couldn't do that and,0.15184265
that's what you really feel in this movie no one can cry no one can,0.15364355
scream no one can take a stick and smack a tree with it so all,0.6164659
the pain anger and emotions as families dealing with they haven't had a release that,0.072143756
is straight up a version of hell they're in hell and since they're feeling that,0.44120324
this movie does a good job of bringing you into the movie you start feeling,0.110448234
it every intense scenario and there are a few of them you don't have release,0.10681856
you don't go you actually do the and you stop breathing this movie really preys,0.684345
on your fight-or-flight and you just freeze in place gotta hand it to a movie,0.24156058
for doing that I mean when you first meet the family having all the noise,0.087550305
go out when the cameras on the girl and having the ambient always come back,0.15986826
when the cameras on the Sun it's genius and illustrating a couple things not only,0.11593974
one of the things about one of the characters but also illustrating the contrast between,0.055606067
quiet and sound does she realize how noisy the world is thus you realize how,0.2779167
hard it is to be quiet cause you realize the danger but I start to,0.10188164
roll my eyes are moments where I'm like alright I've seen this before in movies,0.094540894
and it was just as cliche there well there'd be a particular scenario I'm not,0.057219595
gonna spoil anything there's a scenario that takes longer than the 10 minutes it actually,0.07760361
took and any time you have to bloody hand slapping onto the window I'm like,0.6653703
that is just that's just how many times does that happen well chalk up one,0.07576697
more because in the a quiet place was really unique my biggest flaw in the,0.12384907
movie he's just simply where the movie ends not that the movie ends but where,0.07229486
the movie ends where they decided to go you know what that's the end end,0.09548358
credits just didn't like it gonna keep it vague but personally with me did not,0.08187684
dig that choice but in the end I thought John Krasinski crushed it every the,0.19285712
movie did a great job I was at the edge of my seat I was,0.08155279
white knuckling it and I will say a quiet place is definitely worth watching and,0.6030452
definitely worth buying on blu-ray one of those movies you watch like I want my,0.12463753
friends to watch this movie even if they just watch it once I want them,0.17203288
