but Jen what gel Denise long time no see I'm Denise the pharmacist filmmaker today,0.081351645
I'm gonna be doing a review on the movie The Farewell so this was actually,0.11045447
if you've looked at my January 2020 Mandarin study plan if you haven't like go,0.08773084
check it out but if you looked at that and watch that you know that,0.068848364
one of my ways to motivate myself to continue speaking and learning Mandarin was I,0.11458153
was going to go to a screening of this movie that I had looked up,0.08377447
but called the farewell so it was screening at a university near me and I,0.061396528
was like cool you know I'll go check it out and I had found it,0.087259255
because I was looking up specifically like I googled Chinese movies near me and that,0.15241574
one came up and so at the time I knew it was supposed to be,0.05309978
a movie that was done in Mandarin and also in English about a grandmother who's,0.14824374
terminally ill and her family keeps it a secret from her so that's all I,0.62915826
know about the movie I thought it was a small movie that nobody knew about,0.12563041
like just a little film and then like so I was good I was going,0.07814695
to watch it a specific day like and within that two weeks like before I,0.055669602
was supposed to watch it the Golden Globes happen and I'm Aquafina one the best,0.07009536
aquafina is the lead actress in in the farewell she won Best Actress let me,0.05749538
look at my notes to get this right she won a Golden Globe for Best,0.06421539
Actress in a motion picture comedy or musical and she's the first woman of Asian,0.1495976
descent to win a Golden Globe as a lead actress in any category what like,0.096714854
it was a big deal this is a very big deal movie I thought it,0.08693391
was just like oh you know like something that has some Mandarin in it but,0.062312316
it was awesome and I did watch it and I enjoyed it so after I,0.07318924
found that out I was like oh that's cool so people are gonna be watching,0.085733384
this film now that it's won like an award and let's get into like why,0.09120878
are we still having firsts like why is she the first Asian actress to win,0.18275347
in a lead category we should be on like number 300 think it's 2020 let's,0.052107394
knock it off with the first like let's just you know evolve and let that,0.30221358
happen I don't like that in my day and age so we're still having first,0.126137
stuff like people of color winning things and doing things like no no let's like,0.40602392
let's let's let's fast forward it but I'm very happy and I'm very proud of,0.039503276
her that's that's very awesome alright so let's get into it so it really was,0.090283826
what I thought it was that two-sentence description that I had read about the the,0.03854404
film it was exactly what it was so there's this grandma a9i who's awkwafina's grandma,0.15249668
and she's terminally ill her whole family's not gonna tell her because so like as,0.5876557
an American I'm hearing that and I don't speak for all Americans I'm just telling,0.14502746
you where my perspective is coming from as an American I hear that and I'm,0.10662198
like so doctors and people are gonna lie to you about your health that's disgusting,0.55569834
that's disrespectful that is infringing on your rights as a patient that is you know,0.29810408
messing up HIPPA laws where you have like the right to privacy of your information,0.07866659
and you know like it's everything should be between you and your doctor not like,0.46795225
your doctor tells the truth to your family and lies - you know I was,0.36823657
totally like judgmental about the entire premise of the film because I'm just like that's,0.058097664
not right nope nope nope and nope no I need to know if I'm dying,0.15008011
I want to know so that I can prepare anything I need to prepare you,0.24078585
know like fight for my life you know but in the movie basically one of,0.13658266
the characters explained that I think it was awkwafina's mom said it's not the cancer,0.15214637
that kills you it's the fear like from after you know you have the cancer,0.7421411
um whatever sort of cancer it is so if we don't tell you about the,0.22922456
cancer you won't have fear and you won't die she didn't say that part but,0.34479135
I guess that's the logic behind it she just said it's not the cancer that,0.13580593
kills you it's the fear and so I still didn't accept that because I was,0.69542736
like no it's disrespectful and that's that that's my American viewpoint period so it does,0.15069595
show her the movie that this is common practice for families to keep secrets the,0.09935991
specific secrets of people being terminally ill from the patient and then it seemed like,0.4330206
they can tell you like when you're like on your death but now they'll be,0.5876557
like oh by the way the reason you've been feeling horrible and now you're dying,0.44753483
is because you've been dying well here so it turns out though that 9'i the,0.18661174
grandma she did do the same thing to her husband so once I found that,0.14904088
I was like okay so now that like she was complicit in doing it to,0.17245902
him I guess that means she would be okay with them doing it to her,0.1236239
she would at least understand what they were trying to do and then her nice,0.09062868
sister does say that when he was like it the time was coming that she,0.11531353
did tell him and so night night sister said when the time really really comes,0.15993422
for a night night she will tell her own sister like hey you're dying how,0.48914647
would you know when the time is though like I don't know who are you,0.13218355
to know but I guess you know medical professionals can know and that's when they,0.035032716
tell you okay hospice or you know move to hospice care and move to like,0.0643781
okay you need to set up put your affairs in order like I guess so,0.23625046
but I don't know like things can happen or not like it's not up to,0.09872262
just like us I feel like you know but that's like my religious viewpoint come,0.10521368
in through that it's up to God who knows you know God knows not us,0.09548351
so yeah so like I said I judged it very harshly spoiler alert so like,0.111612685
stop watching right now thanks for watching if you don't want to hear a spoiler,0.12301729
come back again after you've watched it and so like six years later 9i is,0.057050936
alive and well chillin healthy so once I saw that that like she is like,0.12708591
she had this horrible diagnosis that was legit and then they don't tell her because,0.29042083
it's the fear that's gonna get her then six years later she's bear I'm like,0.13405082
hold on do I have it wrong and they have it right with their lies,0.32664418
and deception and my truth is what's killing me what so when it showed that,0.4460864
I was like ah let's let me rethink this let me get my judgemental viewpoint,0.096113935
out of here let me put my judgments to a side and see what's like,0.15300456
working you know let's just go by the facts and the facts show that 9,0.0807419
I beat cancer by being lied to so I guess lies are the cure for,0.24135809
cancer we dance not Western medicine though that's Eastern but it works so I guess,0.15336308
we go with it and there was a doctor who I don't I think he,0.10067615
was trained like out and maybe in England or something and then he was a,0.09000065
Chinese young man who night I was trying to set up you know with Aquafina,0.10336202
and he spoke both English and and Mandarin and he was there during nine eyes,0.06880238
appointment where you know they're all talking in English around her like literally around her,0.10015718
discussing her her fatal / terminally terminal diagnosis and 9ice like oh does he ask,0.16354443
him like you know is is he single young man are you single like she's,0.12081564
asking asking in Mandarin and then Aquafina is like how bad is my grandma and,0.18468966
then he's just like oh you know like he just he lies tonight I like,0.44832322
they all talked about it when the doctor in front of my name like oh,0.044965103
yeah it's bad and then he's like 9 I you know you had pneumonia like,0.31089434
it's just the pneumonia a little bit like of a cold is still left like,0.163641
no no it's her lungs and it's not pneumonia it's terminal which in pneumonia can,0.14071082
can kill you too sometimes but you know what I mean so with that I'm,0.8324562
saying I wanted to bring that point up because like the actual doctor who was,0.06024785
trained in like Western medicine and Western ways was also complicit in this whole lies,0.24338463
and shenanigans and deception so aquafina sort of calls him out on it and she's,0.37051675
like don't you think this is wrong and then he is just like you know,0.26503393
in China a lot of people do those been she's like what if it was,0.09906158
your grandma and he's like well actually when it was my grandma we lied man,0.63217866
she was just like oh okay that's that you know on good movie it was,0.19611245
a good movie I really enjoyed it a lot of strong women a lot of,0.35074407
different generations of women aquafina was not successful in her career I like that that,0.28118798
she was just like a young smart woman trying to make it who's having some,0.2705445
upsets in her career like very realistic and then she's you know an American going,0.14117508
back to China or going to China I mean and her mandarins a little funky,0.5154597
even though it's great like I was so with her speaking Mandarin the whole time,0.08331192
I was like get it aquafina come through with the Mandarin but I could hear,0.061305862
with my little baby I can hear that maybe she had an American accent when,0.10698662
she spoke like obviously I am still learning Mandarin I had not like talked about,0.18194276
anybody's anything with Mandarin but yeah it sounded like she sounded different than the native,0.11577334
speakers and then sometimes like her mom would come through with like these vicious statements,0.53490317
let's clap backs and but it wasn't even a clap back like it was just,0.104245864
like a like it wasn't a defence it was like offense I'm gonna say something,0.100608274
like rude so some people sometimes would be like you know aquafina uncle Mina's mandarin,0.35200113
isn't even good and then Aquafina was thinking of staying in China and not going,0.10213506
back to New York where she's from because all these different because is and then,0.1339861
her mom was like what so your grandma can see your long like sad face,0.79807705
nobody wants to see her face that's not good for anybody like it was so,0.48774135
funny but mean but I was here for it like you know mom's sometimes they,0.18445109
just can be mean so yeah good roles for women very nice way to introduce,0.3284878
a foreign concept in in a very like relatable way from awkwafina's point of view,0.06059282
as an American as a chinese-american dealing with something because her herself she also thought,0.18271379
it was not okay or thought it was weird and didn't approve so I really,0.10403411
enjoyed the movie awesome awesome movie end guys it was directed by a woman luang,0.3459876
