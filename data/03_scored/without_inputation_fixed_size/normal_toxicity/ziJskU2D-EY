hello everybody and welcome back to my channel if you're new here hi i'm mia,0.10259078
tiffany and today we are going to be watching the highly recommended highly anticipated film,0.0794703
casablanca and y'all i am so excited to watch this film okay so casablanca was,0.23042351
released in 1942 directed by michael curtis starring humphrey bogart as rick blaine ingrid bergman,0.123676054
as ilsa lund and paul henried as victor laszlo with other notable performances by claude,0.12117478
raines who we saw actually in mr smith goes to washington sydney greenstreet who we,0.08876966
saw in christmas in connecticut and s z caskel who we've also seen in christmas,0.24567762
in connecticut so i'm excited to see all of them in this film so before,0.42430362
we get into a little bit more of the film background i kind of wanted,0.055938277
to add in some historical background because there was a lot going on around this,0.05684201
film so if you want to stay and listen to the historical background please do,0.068077736
so or if you want to skip right on to the film reaction you can,0.054137234
do that too but without further ado let us get into some historical background okay,0.15169787
so during the time of the film's release the world was at war and because,0.090880424
of that hollywood kind of shifted into more moral boosting and patriotic themes and as,0.10336745
we know casablanca is no stranger to these themes in fact it was originally supposed,0.100656815
to come out in 1943 however they pushed it to 1942 in order to align,0.15534632
it with the allied forces successful invasion of north africa now this invasion uh served,0.18112104
as the first step in sort of weakening the axis powers hold on southern europe,0.12257122
and then in the very next year in january of 1943 the city of casablanca,0.0996819
served as the location for the casablanca conference which was attended by fdr and winston,0.05571714
churchill so not only did all of these events increase the popularity of the film,0.120819464
also show the us's support for the allied forces i also wanted to take a,0.05825743
moment to shout out grouchy marks for adding some of this information in the comments,0.15299155
thank you so much also i really appreciated and loved your story about how your,0.07972225
grandparents went to go see this film and all of the excitement in the movies,0.078751765
so thank you again grouchy marks for sharing that with all of us okay so,0.16436708
a quick synopsis of this film it says a cynical expatriate american cafe owner struggles,0.2540638
to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape,0.1310112
the nazis in french morocco some interesting things that i found about this film so,0.35607427
first of all this film was actually based off of an unproduced play called everybody,0.111824214
comes to ricks written by murray burnett and joan allison now they actually ended up,0.17871587
selling the rights to warner bros for 20 000 which at the time was actually,0.076322705
a record-breaking sum everybody who worked on this film did not anticipate the success that,0.074010424
it would have it actually became the fourth highest grossing film in 1943 taking home,0.08989741
a whopping 10 million 462 500 in the domestic box office it also was nominated,0.11748101
for eight oscars three of which it won for writing directing and then the big,0.06599395
ticket one which is outstanding motion picture yeah so this film is very popular and,0.051006176
had a lot of success and i'm so so so excited and so glad to,0.07904137
be sharing this moment of my first time watching this with all of you i,0.16835578
cannot wait to watch this film but before we do y'all already know the deal,0.08592378
if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel and hit that bell notification to,0.25356928
stay in the loop alright everyone it is time the moment we've all been waiting,0.04373036
for please get your drinks and your snacks and let us get in to casablanca,0.31089434
[Applause] also by the way i have all fruits i have bananas and oranges because,0.07943114
i am trying to be healthy but i wish i had ice cream to all,0.15402333
officers two german couriers carrying important official documents murdered and trained from iran murderer and,0.3888434
possible accomplices headed for casablanca okay i just want to explain really quick so in,0.12732865
the beginning they were saying that um to in order to escape the nazis reign,0.34167358
in europe a lot of refugees traveled from paris down to casablanca and they're waiting,0.09281914
to be able to go to lisbon and then to the new world which i'm,0.11378882
assuming is america so i just wanted to explain that because i feel like that,0.07444119
might have gotten a little lost it might get lost in the editing too so,0.07748517
everyone is trying to leave casablanca to go to lisbon to go to america perhaps,0.14816682
tomorrow will be on the plane i kind of i feel for these people because,0.05769697
they're essentially just sitting ducks you know waiting to be able to have enough money,0.31089434
to go to to basically run to freedom like i just think about the time,0.13679881
that they lived in and how much like stress and uproar and fear that was,0.07707369
probably circulating around during the war it's just really it's surreal like you don't think,0.19281651
about it when you're comfortable in in 2021 just thinking about what happened in the,0.08404491
past but i just imagine what it must have been like for real people who,0.08039245
were trying to escape to freedom like that must have been really hard there's claude,0.078955375
rain unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca thank you captain it's very good to be,0.16828331
here majestrous are my aide lieutenant cassell so the actor who plays major heinrich strausser,0.23746826
he was actually born in berlin and he was publicly known to be anti-nazi but,0.3828356
the only way that he was going to play this role of heinrich strausser is,0.09491026
if the as if the character was quote a villain with no redeeming qualities like,0.12168274
he wanted to make sure that this character didn't have any sort of goodness in,0.07584852
him i guess which i thought was really interesting like that was his only um,0.10531884
his only like i'll only play the role if xyz thank you thank you and,0.074810654
bring the 15 000 franks in cash remember in cash gosh everyone is really trying,0.07809464
to to get out i think they also suspect that or they they feel like,0.099242575
it's only a matter of time because at the time again the nazis were were,0.35566905
storming all these different countries so i i wonder if they thought that it's only,0.29303688
a matter of time before the nazis come to casablanca so i think that's why,0.37318182
everyone just wants to get out as quickly as possible oh humphrey bogart i love,0.27998257
humphrey bogart and i say that honestly that he was actually the first male um,0.3531068
love interest that i saw in the classic film the first classic film that i,0.077573076
ever watched was sabrina with audrey hepburn and humphrey bogart and that began my love,0.15781236
affair with classic films i absolutely love humphrey bogart letters of transit so are those,0.15037821
are those the transit papers that the two germans had did he must have gotten,0.1432768
a hold of them oh my goodness so that makes him like a poi what,0.2530743
else i'm noticing about this film is there's a lot more motion in the camera,0.09621608
i can see that there's a lot more movement in the camera and the cinematography,0.088535234
is is moving and and moving through rick's cafe and i also wonder if that's,0.036071286
because of citizen king because i do remember reading that a lot of cinematography after,0.056823924
that film was really inspired by that film again i i read it somewhere i,0.061872434
i don't know if i'm 100 true so if i'm wrong please correct me but,0.12362718
yeah i'm just noticing there's a lot more movement with the camera and a lot,0.094274424
more pannings and and moving around as if you know we're kind of walking around,0.1463883
with the characters and i really loved seeing that because usually the camera is very,0.03603436
stationary so it kind of has more of a modern feel to it which i,0.09141246
really appreciate who's got nothing we got nothing how much i don't know why like,0.12456954
i don't know why i get so excited to see actors that i've seen in,0.14055282
previous films that we've watched on this channel because it's like duh actors they're in,0.1060753
multiple projects it's like seeing tom cruise and you know just another film but for,0.06756666
some reason for me it's like oh my gosh like i know i know sydney,0.2408273
greenstreet or i know claude rains like i've seen his work before and it's just,0.08162187
so exciting to be able to say that i know their work but then also,0.066681564
to see them you know in different characters in these old films i i don't,0.23959263
know i just get super excited if you guys have do you guys get excited,0.35275057
like that i don't know let me know in the comment box if you do,0.09911439
now i'm officially putting that song in my spotify playlist that was a lot of,0.0923392
fun yeah but i was stuck because he won i love you oh shut up,0.6364068
so the actress that plays yvonne actually outlived all of the other cast members i,0.075564824
don't believe she died until 2016. she died in 2016. yeah that is what a,0.15682267
life but how cool would it have been to to tell people oh yeah i,0.06714332
was actually a cast member in casablanca like that would be so cool i don't,0.2379191
know who were you last night that's so long ago i don't remember will i,0.13328092
see you tonight i never make plans that far ahead i really love how humphrey,0.3921664
bogart is playing into his cynicism it you really feel it from his character and,0.3578291
for some reason i just feel like it it i don't know it just makes,0.09391225
his character more which he's supposed to be cynical but the way that he's playing,0.24187839
it it's like it's so believable like he's he's a really good actor really good,0.31089434
actor you would like to be on it every single time there's a plane that,0.110662706
goes through or a plane that takes off it's very consistent the way that everybody,0.09176608
reacts to it you can tell that they're all just they're just wishing that they,0.10137381
were on that plane but more so it's almost as if it's like a symbol,0.08785052
of freedom which makes more sense because flying when you think of flying anything freedom,0.10835533
but i just love the consistency of of how everyone reacts to a plane taking,0.08170383
off it's just goes to show how much care was taken into this screenplay absolutely,0.09158527
there is a man arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer,0.17521346
a fortune to anyone who'll furnish him with an exit visa what's his name victor,0.25017276
laszlo no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i,0.4766048
should say too why too he's traveling with a lady how convenient that there were,0.12281933
two german couriers who were murdered for their exit visas and now there are two,0.4475041
people who need said exit visas to escape the nazis i mean it most likely,0.32372975
was done intentionally are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans and,0.26993954
their beloved paris not particularly my beloved paris can you imagine us in london when,0.13062447
you get there ask me so watching this i feel like i don't know i,0.13008422
didn't i didn't read this anymore but this is just a hunch have you guys,0.25130057
ever seen quentin tarantino's and glorious bastards well this scene reminds me of the scene,0.7685777
when they're like in the pub or like in the the bar and there's like,0.17494965
tensions are heightened because michael fassbender's character is like a you know he's like a,0.19714127
double agent they're all sitting around the table it really reminds me of this scene,0.15072264
so i don't know if this scene was influenced or that scene was influenced by,0.09593689
this scene or if it was just kind of a coincidence which i don't feel,0.15117057
like there are coincidences in in hollywood but i don't know it just it really,0.08150398
reminds me of that scene oh and if you guys know if quentin tarantino really,0.10668327
did get inspiration from this scene please let me know in the comment box i,0.06683383
would love to know that piece of information how about new york well there are,0.08125511
certain sections of new york major that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade,0.21454218
uh-huh who do you think will win the war with the slightest idea i really,0.258197
appreciated that when he asked him who do you think will win the war and,0.105626345
he's like i haven't the slightest idea that he didn't push well it first of,0.109897
all it's not even in his character to push which side would win but i,0.12836795
appreciate that they didn't make that into uh oh we think americans are gonna win,0.17206843
or we think the germans are gonna win like they made it very neutral which,0.18833463
obviously fit for bogart's character but i think that that that just had a little,0.09233393
bit more of a innuendo in there like at the time they didn't know who,0.14922707
was going to win the war and there was a lot of fear that was,0.08951079
like circled around who's going to win and what's gonna happen afterward but i appreciate,0.1511645
that they left that ambiguous because i feel like if they were to push it,0.10370306
you know into the more patriotic side and say the americans are you know like,0.16470309
the allied forces are gonna win then i feel like it would have been a,0.06517772
little bit too um like it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been realistic just obviously,0.15396154
for the time that it came out i'm just really happy that they left that,0.07853336
ambiguous so that it's not you know giving people false hope if the allied forces,0.24705552
didn't win oh so that's victor laszlo thank you but i hardly think then perhaps,0.09001599
for the lady the ring is quite unique oh yes i'm very interested i love,0.062606886
the spy elements of this movie too like there is a lot of like it,0.09858887
almost feels like i don't know if that's right like espionage i don't know if,0.0790172
that's the right word but there's a lot of like spy elements in this film,0.090010375
that the two german couriers for the transit papers got in play as time goes,0.07466781
by sing it sam you must remember this a kiss is just a key wow,0.17528842
what a beautiful the music in this movie kudos to max steiner i i don't,0.061938133
believe he's alive anymore but kudos to him for for using this music and he's,0.1457918
like why are you playing this song bro did you see that longing stare i,0.1652828
want to know the history there of all the gin joints and all the towns,0.1263548
in all the world she walks into mine so under all that cynicism and under,0.55661124
all that that he puts up there really truly is a sentimental man i mean,0.11955063
you can see it and the way he's acting like the way that he is,0.08456852
almost longing for her like dang i love flashbacks so they had a love of,0.19025706
a love affair and penalty we said no questions is looking at you kid oh,0.31089434
it's like the line well one of the lines but still why there is no,0.06368569
other man in my life that's easy that was he's dead i'm sorry for asking,0.456613
nothing kills a beautiful love story like war wednesday thursday at the latest they'll be,0.26440877
in paris they'll find out your record it won't be safe for you here i'm,0.07934289
on a blacklist already i will say it is interesting to hear other accents like,0.14989768
we on this channel we've heard the british accent in the 1930s but ingrid bergman,0.1846994
is from sweden and so to hear her accent on top of the like the,0.07055519
1930s way that they used to talk is very interesting because it sounds very different,0.057198647
than what a swedish accent sounds like now this sort of takes a sting out,0.31477094
of being occupied does it mr richard you said it he's looking at you kid,0.24003772
i didn't know he said it multiple times in the movie i thought it was,0.058280002
just honestly i thought it was just that one time at the end like that,0.066239975
one scene that they always show where they're like in the rain but i guess,0.053567417
he says it multiple times i love that though or is it my heart pounding,0.17418115
so this may ruin some parts of this movie for you and i apologize in,0.41863683
advance so ingrid bergman was two or three inches taller than humphrey bogart which means,0.24031945
that whenever they whenever they did scenes together they had humphrey either stand on the,0.12416043
platform or they tied like boxes like platforms to his shoes to make him seem,0.073914886
taller than ingrid and then ingrid would would be acting barefoot and so that i,0.40322924
just think it's funny because during the romantic scenes you want to be like oh,0.1039742
it's so romantic and then you think to yourself but he's standing on a platform,0.23809963
at that point no no no no we must leave yes of course we the,0.06455031
train for my saili's at five o'clock i'll pick you up at your hotel at,0.19179286
4 30. christmas if it were the last time so another random piece of movie,0.06535912
fact so this scene well this flashback scene was one of the first scenes that,0.09871275
they shot in the production schedule and humphrey bogart was like he's like i don't,0.35074162
want to shoot these scenes because i'm not like all about that romance life or,0.770344
something like that he said something like that and michael curtis was like you know,0.114316106
what we just got to get it we got to get it grab it and,0.07363307
we'll move on to the other stuff so i just thought that was interesting a,0.053452943
little interesting fun fact to note yeah but now everyone is fleeing from paris gosh,0.07494422
the just i could just imagine like the chaos and the pandemonium but then also,0.11484033
there's that aspect of like there's a sadness like you're leaving some people had to,0.11385906
leave you know their homes and the place where they grew up for a land,0.11346804
that they a foreign land to them so it's just like i said i think,0.08502162
in the last in the last video these films really give you insight into kind,0.23777458
of how life was lived during the time and there's just there's a there's a,0.07314634
sadness that i feel for these people that were uprooted out of their lives because,0.1358681
of this war like it's it's just it's really sad it says richard i cannot,0.10055933
go with you or ever see you again you must not ask why just believe,0.11801406
that i love you go my darling and god bless you ilsa oh so she,0.15433867
left him she was acting real shady in the last scene and that's what broke,0.2591926
his heart i wonder if that's where his cynicism comes from because he doesn't seem,0.44249365
very cynical in this flashback he seems like a sentimentalist so this must have made,0.40824828
him cynical and there she is oh no this spells trouble oh god i feel,0.44498587
bad for both of them it kind of has elements of brief encounter where they,0.13619721
weren't trying to fall in love they were just two people who happened to meet,0.14475259
in paris who fell in love and yeah and that sucks sometimes life just sucks,0.8606264
can i tell you a story it's about a girl who had just come to,0.17014429
paris from her home in oslo she met a man about whom she had heard,0.12621818
her whole life everything she knew or whatever became was because of him but the,0.1526682
feeling she supposed was love she's not talking about rick i think she's talking about,0.2816328
victor when she was talking about meeting a man after coming from oslo oh tell,0.107164904
me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others,0.20253101
in between aren't you the kind to tell wow he's just talking out of anger,0.24804938
and and pain don't let it get to you or you may leave for lisbon,0.1513188
tomorrow on one condition you know the leader of the underground movement in paris in,0.08685121
prague you'll furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your,0.3878461
visa in the morning laszlo is literally telling this this um heinrich that like yeah,0.13206132
i'm i'm the leader of the like he they all know that he's a leader,0.09857716
of the resistance and but there's no like guns being drawn there's no you know,0.1100814
no violent things happening and it's just interesting to see the production code and and,0.08979697
the role that it plays in this in the storytelling because i feel like if,0.042658128
this was a film that were to come out in 2021 or you know in,0.1316676
the 2000s there would be a lot more violence there'd be a lot more like,0.19080828
struggle because like i said i was watching and i'm like why isn't why isn't,0.046605997
heinrich like doing anything like physically like why isn't he like you know like shooting,0.4902545
guns or like you know holding him down or restraining him or or on the,0.18127355
flip side like why why does everyone know the um laszlo secret like wouldn't that,0.0965274
be more secretive but no and i i suspect it's because of the production code,0.086805955
so it's just interesting to see its influence did you run out on me because,0.13272099
you couldn't take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the,0.1071503
police running away all the time no you say victor lasler is my husband and,0.31089434
was even when i knew you in paris oh oh my god so she was,0.09056343
married when they were in love in paris what also doesn't that violate the haze,0.16519023
code because oh i guess it doesn't because she because she thought that her husband,0.1863958
was dead have you heard about senior gotti in the letters of transit yes something,0.10605043
those letters were not found in a guardian when they arrested him you know where,0.11251835
they are not for sure i'll venture to guess that a god he left those,0.15340763
letters with messier oh so now they know that rick has the papers oh that's,0.082206495
lovely god i love the boldness of lazlo he's so bold and i absolutely love,0.23696645
him i love his character i really love him and everyone stands out to sing,0.07784447
the french the french national anthem i have goosebumps that's awesome more than anything now,0.21636914
i need rick to give him the transit papers yes but no intention of selling,0.038850833
them when i was in a concentration camp where you lonely in paris he knows,0.1702149
he has to know why would he ask that and she's there how did she,0.08693049
get in there all right oh she has a gun pointed at him no i,0.31221363
want those letters go ahead and shoot he'll be doing me a favor she's not,0.7952015
gonna shoot you she loves you their their romance and their chemistry is very you,0.833838
can you can tell that there's a lot of chemistry between their characters but i,0.05365901
also read that behind the scenes they weren't as romantic with each other but it's,0.15126316
just it's interesting because their chemistry is so good i knew it it's romantic so,0.06816307
that scene was only allowed because of an editing difference because of the dissolve that,0.09471095
we just saw they used a dissolve instead of a fade out because at the,0.08047331
time a fade out suggested that two people were taking things a step further if,0.07136377
you know what i mean if you're catching my wind so instead of a fade,0.11483969
out they decided to do a dissolve into the next scene and so that's why,0.104588166
