del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins as Eliza who is mute and works at a,0.05813572
facility where Michael Shannon and other workers bring in this creature from South America that,0.04512606
lives in the water it's like at The Creature from the Black Lagoon or the,0.057485837
creature from Hellboy that's why first thought of when I saw this creature and she,0.1473834
builds a connection and relationship with this creature because he sees her for who she,0.09910904
is he doesn't understand that she is mute and she can't speak so he doesn't,0.045170628
have that idea about her so there she builds this connection because she really feels,0.03312282
like she is missing something in her life she feels like she is just not,0.05667764
part of something and having this creature in her life it kind of fills that,0.19231856
void and makes her feel a part of something well she was like how this,0.06344788
