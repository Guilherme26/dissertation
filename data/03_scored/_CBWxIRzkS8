first requested to me by Hunter Brown and directed and co-written by Pete docter inside-out,0.11860234
is a 2015 Pixar animation film that accounts the story of young Reilly and everything,0.060901687
going on within her mind Reilly is an only child moves to San Francisco with,0.07681469
her mom and dad at the age of 11 and has trouble coping with the,0.44333437
move at first there's five emotions that help dictate her behaviors and decision-making and these,0.07449127
five emotions all have something different to offer to Riley's personality and they include joy,0.08460577
sadness anger fear and disgust and all these emotions attempt to provide Riley with the,0.20830649
most well-rounded and satisfying life possible but one day something goes terribly wrong and the,0.15505472
five emotions are forced to solve an entirely new problem for Riley all right so,0.061316837
when so that was a film that I figured I need to watch again because,0.061340105
I know that it's beloved by almost everyone inhaled it's one of the best Pixar,0.09777482
films today top 5 for most people at least and well for me I remember,0.0681347
watching it back in 2015 and thinking it was all right but not want to,0.05996982
Pixar's best like everyone else was saying I enjoyed it but I didn't fall in,0.08208079
love with it like many others did and when I watched it again yesterday I,0.07154255
still feel pretty much the same way I think that there are exceptional moments in,0.06636937
this film and other moments and even long stretches of time actually where just loses,0.09653109
me basically anything that has Riley in it or addresses her actually facing real problems,0.14207304
relatable problems at almost every viewer can understand and empathize with her on that's when,0.0926082
I like it when I don't like it is when something happens this sends two,0.09646002
of the emotion characters off from the rest of the group and it separates them,0.05198774
from the group in a separate plotline they sort of takes over the film and,0.062940955
they have to find their way back to the headquarters this guy little plot line,0.25992265
this whole conflict just kind of lost me and I found this act in general,0.102679946
plotline to be kind of boring and emotionally dry I think any time that we,0.30226484
actually see Riley and the effect that her emotions are actually having on her and,0.06938286
the difficulty she's experiencing as an 11 year old child dealing with a difficult move,0.1740584
on top of other things that's when the movie hooks me it got me in,0.10496776
the fields there because even though I've never had to deal with a difficult move,0.07058526
specifically like that there's plenty of other things that she's going through that I could,0.105387405
relate to feelings of insecurity trying to fit in and make friends feeling like no,0.060249243
one understands how you're feeling in general these are all complex feelings and just things,0.054706894
that kids go through that I think Pixar tackles pretty creatively and pretty effectively and,0.107968174
inside out the problem for me is that they don't always stick to it this,0.07633366
movie really got me in the fields quite a bit actually but like I said,0.09580276
it just loses me every the two emotions go off on their own plot line,0.18377277
and start trying to navigate their way to return to the control center and we,0.035188116
stabilize things for Riley at this point the film starts to focus too heavily on,0.050011545
characters that in my opinion just aren't quite strong enough to stand on their own,0.10617873
for this plotline you primarily follow joy and sadness played by Amy Poehler and Phyllis,0.056752272
Smith respectively who performed the role admirably but are ultimately voicing characters that feel very,0.016980244
uninspired it's not like these characters don't have distinct personalities they certainly do but I,0.10237048
just feel like they're not that interesting and they can't effectively carry the story along,0.05773778
as a buddy duo the way the film asked them to but like I mentioned,0.06630444
I do have to get Pixar credit for creating a really compelling and creative story,0.031324178
here pretty much every Pixar film in existence delivers something for everyone it delivers fun,0.13788608
it delivers silly but it also delivers a story that has way more depth to,0.4861705
it than almost all of its animated competitors the premise of the story itself is,0.041885875
very cool emotions that are pulling the strings within your mind they dictate how you,0.15633059
respond to the world around you is a very interesting concept and it's mostly pretty,0.10018298
well executed I did continually think to myself that this is a very cool concept,0.19016767
for an animated film and it tackles some important issues that almost every kid faces,0.11200035
at some point the film certainly has to be recognized for its creativity and how,0.10798757
it just approaches complex subject matter however here's something else I didn't quite love there's,0.0598722
a character named sadness that I previously mentioned played by Phyllis Smith who gave off,0.04438888
some real finding Dory vibes to me because she's basically a killjoy and it's all,0.40336677
about being sad and making Riley sad and all that and I just found her,0.10306
character to be very tough to deal with in large doses and there is a,0.089207835
purpose to her a bigger picture to the character that's made clear in the third,0.08976993
act but man every time she was talking on screen I were just like can,0.0849333
we please cut to another emotion because she just really started to wear on me,0.28255373
and I think I'd be fine with her in small doses but she plays a,0.2244293
very big role in the second act and onward and I just felt like her,0.10495039
character didn't contribute anything positive to the overall enjoyment level of the film and considering,0.052549444
this is an animated kid's film first and foremost I think I'd be pretty remiss,0.1838119
if I didn't at least discuss the brand of comedy with you because I think,0.1645397
it works pretty well for the most part and I consider it a pro because,0.06744145
it definitely is well written for the most part and witty more often than not,0.05639594
there's definitely cases where I can get a little too kiddush with some of the,0.100592695
emotion characters just sort of doing over-the-top things are designed to be sort of slapstick,0.21637693
and appease to a kids sense of humor but generally speaking I did find myself,0.10109857
chuckling fairly often and the comedy does help balance out some pretty serious tone ISM,0.12064053
to feel more versatile and of course more family-friendly but overall I don't love inside-out,0.08160688
it's not one of my favorite Pixar films but I do think it's alright it's,0.10971491
not a bad film and I totally understand people that like it more than I,0.1150148
do but for me there's just a couple things holding you back from being great,0.11162943
either way let's take a look at the pros cons list so as for the,0.06618919
pros I thought inside-out executes a rich and creative premise has strong coming-of-age themes that,0.2061979
are ripe with emotion and also offers some quality comedy to balance the film out,0.06990498
as for the cons I think the film loses some momentum for most back to,0.08886359
and a little bit after that as well and some of the characters just aren't,0.06624299
the strongest overall I'm gonna give inside-out a 7 point 5 out of 10 and,0.115126304
generally recommend you check it out wherever you can if you're looking for a well-rounded,0.0990707
Pixar film to me this isn't one of their best but it's still solid enough,0.10744811
so if you guys seen inside out what did you think of it and if,0.10069924
not let me know why not know so let me know your favorite Pixar film,0.15878545
still Toy Story 3 for me either way that's all for now this is wolf,0.12547623
