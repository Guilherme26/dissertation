in this movie first let me go ahead and say this when they cast gal gadot for Wonder Woman I was not for it,0.22145909
I was like I don't know man she kind of small man,0.49417773

and when I saw the trailer,0.065757826
I was like okay I'm rolling with this one,0.12492844
and then when they finally came with that Wonder Woman trailer and you guys go back and watch my archive go back and watch mark I actually should be a above right now go back and watch those trailer review trailer reactions because I talked a lot about it but my gosh she was better than I ever thought,0.1786901
she could be I never thought,0.16044004
she would have that inner,0.10949959
and and I mean that was the most respect she was amazing she was Wonder Woman oh my gosh the ladies and gentlemen the story was done so well guys,0.1646356
you guys are let me break this down watching gal on the island of the mascara was dope the costumes won't point guys I really felt like I was there watching,0.24416037
the sisters the Amazon warriors care for that woman that girl that little that little baby was amazing,0.35954309
I love the fact that we got a chance to see the the the Amazons and there were all different different cultures,0.06577735
you know I mean they were all one,0.11015996
they were also super,0.06045475
they're all different cultures,0.07329973
I love the costume design I love,0.076740764
how they had like the black the sisters the black ones and their hair they didn't they didn't,0.38348302
they didn't look fake,0.210463
you know I mean,0.121584825
they didn't look fake at all,0.18122773
I didn't they look authentic,0.060456555
they had the thick hair,0.15084633
but they put,0.06184637
it back till they combed it it was perfect,0.25539967
I loved every bit of it dope gal though stood out like a sore thumb,0.25108802
and I mean in a good way when she spoke there at home that accident works that accident,0.27352458
I never was against accident,0.08440493
now oh I love the fact when when when they stay true to the character in that form that accent worked because it made her even more exotic watching you you felt,0.10498194
she was authentic she'll authentic Amazon and I loved every bit of it,0.14367996
she did her thing with that she truly from beginning from seeing her from the beginning,0.09558081
she truly made me believe that she's one a woman,0.31089434
I believe she was wondering when I was about to be Superman,0.13165224
but when I got a chance to see the origin of her,0.10285352
I was like oh my god she's really Wonder Woman because she stood for everything one of them instead for and it's not just power just as in truth autocrat like that,0.14398421
it's the woman,0.19116388
she was young but she was a sister,0.14967552
she was a hunt,0.24836513
she was a cousin,0.15207075
she was a grand mom she she was all the women in the world and you can fill it off of her,0.44344145
she was perfect perfect when she met Chris Pines Steve Trevor it was I I kid you not guys it was magic it was magic watching those two on screen together,0.14891541
they had a great chemistry,0.068140745
this movie has a lot of good chemistry those two,0.07891484
it was like I kid you not it was like watching them from just watching this like watching this show and you see them and it shows on for ten years and you watch them grow and have kids in the family,0.11780492
that's how it was that chemistry was perfect,0.084483
it was it was innocent,0.073561236
it was sweet it was funny it was caring,0.10012402
it was sad,0.060966957
it was every emotion you can have and you can see him this has to be Chris Pines probably the best role,0.035284534
he's ever done because you can see the acting chops,0.12334119
he has I see two actors,0.15963593
she's actor to actor is an actor that elevated their skills to the max in this film,0.18874544
and my gosh it worked,0.11276772
I felt like those two knew that they're going to show up the world and they both on the same page with it,0.06827027
and it worked that chemistry between those two was beautiful,0.058590833
I loved every bit of it guys I mean it was so sweet watching them it was dope was the same it was it was it was three scenes that I will never forget and I loved I have to say a little bit something,0.19576746
it was a scene you guys see when they're not when when they showed them in like a like a water room or something like that like a little cave or something was probably one of the funniest things that I ever experienced in a superhero,0.13575447
I loved every bit of it because it wasn't necessarily meant to be funny it was logical and it was dope at the same time because it was real the movie felt real it felt real it was vibrant,0.1138839
it felt real it didn't feel like a comic-book movie it felt like it felt like a a Greek mythology story that actually really happened it felt like a biblical story that actually happened it worked guys my gosh it worked those two on camera magic shout out the GAO shout-out to Chris Pine doing your thing that right,0.096181035
there it's gonna be hard to replicate that I've never seen that in a superhero movie never never beautiful beautiful moments right there with them - oh my gosh I can't wait to talk about,0.13472898
him huh that was tight next the directing guys the directing oh my gosh this uh you remember this the music the story chemistry the actors the actors and actors chemistry the chemistry mixed with the story and the,0.06832402
music this was a beautiful web going on,0.0796704
right now let's get into the director of the movie miss patty Jenkins patty Jenkins outdid herself in this movie I remember we went,0.087015025
back we went,0.050862554
back we go,0.05740286
back let's go back a couple months,0.14798467
right and I went to WonderCon with my,0.048670046
boys you know Judy Joe Savin Jackson you know ap5 we was there it was a couple other people who didn't show up but we,0.069364205
went we got a chance to watch patty Jenkins and a couple of scenes of Wonder,0.09269929
Woman I was when I are your life when I saw that I was sold on the movie when I saw a scene I was like oh my gosh this is,0.30062747
tight,0.061190806
she explained what she was trying to do what she wanted to do with the film she says she wanted to make a Richard Donner film she wanted to go Casablanca and I see the Casablancas vibe with those two characters bad Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor I see it I see it oh man I see it is there,0.14994043
she went that Lois and Clark bye I telling you guys is there,0.062965594
it's beautiful love right there,0.058174
so sorry so but when I got a chance to watch it this woman I is amazing,0.2406966
she knows how to capture the right scene at the right time,0.14926663
it's amazing guys from seeing the mascara,0.17804235
the beautiful landscape,0.063863784
watching the the costume of the the Amazons and their costumes and looking so authentic such a beautiful vibe the whole time watching young Diana as the issue is forget her name her name is Emily something,0.084286645
I can't remember,0.05182252
but she played young Princess Diana she was beautiful she's a little girl and she's a thorn her thing you could see the the curiosity in her head,0.3738643
you can see she wanted to be something greater for someone to capture stuff,0.15057805
like that that's amazing guys,0.077963285
this project is that her thing in this movie she directed,0.15000793
so many scenes and they were all amazing,0.054442484
I didn't know she knew how to direct action guys,0.1345671
I didn't know I was shocked the action scenes in this movie are are on point,0.050084703
I'm gonna be honest machine,0.15111755
the action seems to me personally,0.08024668
and this is not being biased or anything the action,0.10398948
seems just basically say this take Winter Soldier right take Winter Soldier before Bucky takes his mask off all that before Bucky takes his mask off take Winter Soldier and then add it in with Man of Steel,0.09449462
that's what you get you get a complete believable facing because you know she's Wonder Woman so she gonna do things,0.31089434
some some things like Superman,0.07953631
but the the the the choreography of the fight scenes are like Winter Soldier,0.103313915
so it works,0.053302526
it works in the time frame it is dope,0.2703657
the actions she did her thing on those actions things,0.15285914
the action scenes are on point that right,0.06031182
there was the shocker for me,0.084790654
because before before I see what I saw at WonderCon,0.058327105
I was always worried about okay,0.06606497
well she got a fight how's she gonna get down,0.26110363
you know,0.07163658
I mean I know gal has a background in military,0.07521871
uh she was in a military,0.16505982
so she has a background of that military training all that stuff like that so I was like okay how they gonna use her how are you gonna use her and they use their well she was on point Wonder Woman action scenes were my god why,0.109449044
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,0.10985789
this is real true spit was better than bad be Superman,0.38431114
it was better than the Batman warehouse scene,0.09062182
it was better than that,0.08004281
and let me explain the reason why it was better than that is because it was God doing most of that on some note some notes,0.10039467
and then explained that the warehouse scene was planned Batman planned that he knew I mean people was in a room,0.11479824
he knew this Wonder Woman was a warrior y'all,0.13459912
she didn't count how many people on the field didn't why didn't she just wait and served them all up that's why it gets the edge of a Batman's fight scene for me because she went in there with her eyes closed she was blindfolded and she handled business,0.14372696
that's why she gets the edge over the Batman V Superman fight scene now personally got all,0.09428692
the Batman scene,0.07142471
I want the Fighting's I've seen when her soldier,0.13580011
and that Batman warehouse was on point no for real but wonder woman gets the cake on that y'all,0.30133083
she gets that that that fight scene was tight guys,0.3257854
I was in the audience and some stuff happened and I can I was tight and everybody's looking at me they was looking at me,0.080290064
I was like what you looking at that was trying,0.07443038
I was excited when I saw that man I was excited when I saw that that was dope way anyway moving on actually sings on point hey Jenkins director dope that was that was amazing,0.2707247
I shocked shocked by how well this film was put together in the chemistry base,0.053829305
and it makes sense the director held his movie together but casting didn't let nobody stop they helped they held it,0.06391212
I felt like they held each other together Chris was like you know God I know people hating on you,0.44605333
and I'm gonna help you out and she was like thank you,0.15335637
and I'm gonna make sure that what you do for me,0.109537125
ain't gonna do,0.087683335
it is it's like,0.055545386
that's how I felt like,0.07753522
they were I felt like,0.08005623
and I don't know if this is true but I really felt like he was like a real friend to her,0.19270395
it was like look,0.06698927
I know us a lot of haters out there but we gonna make sure we give a hundred and thirty-five percent and you can feel it,0.11744628
you can see the way they looked at each other,0.07067123
it was like a real true friendship,0.08660061
and they held each other together throughout this film with the support of director and the story and the music shouts to Geoff Johns and the music it was a great triangle guys it really worked,0.056179207
this movie was tight,0.23978391
I love this movie guys this was a great film enjoyed it,0.24013393
I can't wait to purchase it,0.091396436
I can't wait to watch it again,0.110732146
I know personally I'm gonna watch this movie at least ten times in theaters guys,0.14984657
I ignore him because I'm a Dark Knight,0.17875962
I watched it 18 times but I know my worst movie least ten times,0.13303472
I gotta take my daughter,0.29998204
it's summers hitting up,0.1634095
we gonna be in theater,0.057048533
watching this movie,0.087958775
you know I mean I I know I'm gonna watch it,0.1671719
I know I'm gonna enjoy it,0.08964772
it's gonna be a great experience watching of multiple times this film is dope guys,0.45205903
please go watch this movie we need these type of movies to grow,0.14952418
because if they grow now Warner Brothers knows that's for real they need to know,0.060574703
this is how you make a movie because this gives other movies hope the hope that we need the the the the spirit of the comic book world for real keeping the 100,0.07521801
now a lot of people were saying that oh let me get your great before I do that I give Wonder Woman,0.15208806
that's what I give this movie this is the best superhero origin film of all time,0.088142425
as of now nothing is topping this movie as of now people can argue but I'm explaining why you can't argue with this,0.12770027
because Wonder Woman is a true superhero film Dark Knight Batman you'll got no powers bruh,0.1808983
that's what it is,0.04899489
yeah he has that out because I'm Batman we got no,0.08427883
powers,0.06534943
Dark Knight is good for the best realistic hero film all time anyway topping that and he's been as of now name of topping it but comic book movie Wonder Woman and the best origin story even beat my battle against I love this origin story this ordnance story was tight I loved every bit of this this is what we call an epic origin I loved it I learned so much about Wonder Woman in this story guys the story was so dope man there was a scene when she had a language battle with a dude,0.12823966
I mean she had a language battle he was like this guy right,0.18063438
here knows a bunch of languages as soon as I only she's tight,0.35116112
this is Wonder Woman,0.15477243
this is dope loved it great film guys great film,0.17294776
