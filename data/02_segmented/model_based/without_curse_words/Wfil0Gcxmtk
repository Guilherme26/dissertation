You are watching Critic calmly back here today with a review for Wonder Woman, which was directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pawnee, Robin Wright, Dani Hudson and David Thewlis, it is the first female alleged superhero movie has directed by a woman, and it's also the first movie to be directed by Roman Anteater, a female protagonist, as well as the first live-action theatrical adaptation of the character of Wonder Woman, though it is the fourth film in the Dc Extended Universe, and Wonder Woman previously appeared in Batman V Superman, Dawn of Justice from last year. This film happens before the three of the Dc Eu films. It takes place in World War One and tells the origin story of Wonder Woman. I'll just start right off the bat. Wonder Woman is a triumph for the Dc Eu, and the best Dc film since the Dark Nights. No question, Wonder Woman hits such a glorious homerun that I almost got out of my seat and started cheering. And this is the darn truth. How does the people of my theater gave the film a standing ovation when the credits started rolling? But why? well, let me tell you when it comes to films that are centered around one character and a vast multiverse. it is imperative that the filmmakers get that character right. Wonder Woman is written by Zack Snyder, Allan Heinberg and Jason Rush, and portrayed by Gal Gadot Superbly. Her entire dynamic screams fish out of water, and those types of characters are the ones I find to be easily relatable as Diana Prince walks along the streets of London, marveling at the fashion popular at the time, or witnesses soldiers coming home from the war, battered and broken. You can relate to her. She isn't some experienced veteran who's used to seeing brutality like this or some fashion supernova. She is a minnow in a pond, chock full of piranhas. I made no capable of cracking open a can of whoop-ass whenever she feels like it. I might add, the characterization of Wonder Woman / Diana Prince is unmatched in this extended universe, and that's complemented by Gal Gadot Colossal Ii Charismatic performance. Gadot exhibits OnPoint line delivery and excellent displays of emotion, and this is her best work to date. In my opinion, Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor, and the romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfying me in vest, and not sappy, as the main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fault flat, but not when it comes to this film, everyone else put on really good or great performances, with Lucy Davis, particularly shining on the flipside of substance. The visual / Cgi effects were top-notch although there were some parts that boasted uneven Cgi specifically the fire effects. However, one particular department I'm not single out is the stunt work. The stunts are amazing, and something I can appreciate that Patty Jenkins does not use varying camera angles to mask the not so spectacular stunt. Not that that's a bad thing, because even the worst stunts were still good. That tells you how dedicated Jenkins was to this project and I dearly hope that she holds more films in the Dce. You. Now, back to what I was previously discussing, the fighting sequences themselves are something to behold. Unlike Captain America, Civil War, where there were some fighting scenes worth complaining about, I can't recall one dole moment of action throughout this entire film. The action and fighting sequences kept me on the edge of my seat throughout this movie's runtime. While the drama rarely ever lets up. Deign what agendas? Is its Wonder Woman just as great as the Dark Knight. No, but it does come close. so overall, Wonder Woman is a standout among the Dc Eu. not just because it's colorful. They're not a depression inducing shade of gray, but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular character is unparalleled. One room / Diana Prince is both a fierce warrior and a curious individual, determined to restore peace to mankind and learn all about the Rays of life, as well, intensely terrific action, a conclusive plot, a satisfying main romance and a colorful tone with serious elements all gelled together to form my favorite film of 2017. So far, whether you're a longtime fan of the character or recently introduced, you don't get your money's worth, and more with the Dce Use Magnum Opus, and hopefully this will set an example for the folks at Dc and the years to come. So with that being said, I'm going to give Wonder Woman an eight point four out of 10 stars. I'm definitely picking up the blu-ray once that gets released. Know that I even feel an urge to go watch this movie again at the theater so great it was. so. what did you think of Run, woman? Did you like it? Did you not like it? Did you love it?
