I make a concerted effort to not read other reviews before writing my own lest my opinions be colored by those of people more intelligent than I but a filmed podcast Facebook group I'm a part of pointed me to the genuinely bad take that is,0.21441315
Richard Brody's New Yorker review of actress Olivia Wilde's directorial debut book smart now I often disagree with Brody which is fine but this piece genuinely bothered me because it fails to do what Glen Kenny told a group of aspiring film critics six years ago of which I was one what should be the backbone of their writing talk about what the thing is not what you think it should be,0.18353613
it's bad if anyone does the latter but it is almost painful to read the 71 year old Brody lecture book smart about high school,0.1505752
tell it that it fails to accurately represent high school which is so obviously ridiculous that saying it out loud basically serves as its own mic drop equally bizarre is the opening paragraphs rant about how the film fails politically by not explicitly mentioning Trump the way it implicitly mentions powerful admirable,0.53490317
women like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elizabeth Warren again it is such a self-evidently stupid thing to say as though the best part of Mean Girls to which he compares book-smart unfavorably was the one where Lindsay Lohan went on a 15-minute rant about the injustice,0.74513865
'as of the Bush administration shouldn't all people be canceled maybe old people should be canceled the reason to never talk about what a thing should be is that ultimately your idealized version doesn't matter and a 71 year old man's wants for the depiction of a teenage girls high school experience could not possibly matter less,0.13482583
no one who goes into book smart is going to see this version with anti-trump monologues and Mean Girls archetypes so blathering on about them isn't helpful to the discourse and in any case we should all be thankful because that movie would suck hello anyone everyone and welcome to the week at review,0.54553276
you can call me,0.18223535
a guy who doesn't actually think old people should be canceled,0.3255399
and today I am talking about book smart,0.15364641
I mentioned to the same colleague referenced in the introduction of my Pokemon detective Pikachu review that I was a big fan of this film's spoiler I guess and he said of course you'd say that you've been doing this for literal years walking over to my desk edge of seventeen is the best movie ever blockers is the best movie ever,0.07479925
and now this come back when you've seen one of these movies you don't like so I'm probably never gonna see him again,0.2042961
because although I have never been a teenage girl I often relate to their coming-of-age narratives more than I do teenage boys the Afra mention films alongside some deeper but still fairly recent cuts like detention and girl asleep do genuinely rank among my favorite films of their years,0.13320625
but also period I just really connect with them on a fundamental level,0.054368906
although my reaction to eighth grade during which I sided pretty heavily with the father because he was doing his best suggests that that may be changing,0.06217088
and the fact that I can so quickly name a number of recent releases is a sign that this back half of the 2010s has marked the beginning of a new era of r-rated teen comedies now finally told from girls perspectives we're now 15 years removed from Mean Girls which remains a seminal film but was not of course rated R and that film focused more on overall social dynamics than this newer breed the way different groups interact will never not be a part of a movie about high school,0.12667511
but so often they're the central focus when to a lot of people they aren't actually that big a deal book-smart goes hard in the other direction by arguing that people can't be typed at all that they are complicated,0.110646896
and we need to stop pretending other WAIS on her last day of high school II not very nice protagonist slash class president Molly is forcibly put into proximity with many of the people who she has been elected to represent you know people she has been judging out of hand for years,0.25694302
and she learns inevitably that not everything,0.10705036
she thinks she knows about,0.09531801
these people is true and even the stuff that is can't define them except the theater kids,0.15902688
they're exactly who you think there has Czech theater kids represented I found it really interesting though to see how people reacted to her again this isn't some world where people pour milkshakes on losers,0.53444815
and leave dead animals in their locker even if people don't like her they generally react in kind treating her how she treats them hell even the one moment that could be seen as this sort of cliche drama where Molly is in the bathroom stall as three of her peers,0.24353555
talk about her is undercut by one of them openly expressing his attraction to her if not her personality,0.31089434
and when she confronts them she tries to go personal telling them they will never amount to anything while she is rising through the ranks and then she is metaphorically smacked down by the most scathing of revelations that she and her best friend Amy are not the only capital s smart people in the school the girl was collectively slut-shamed as triple a it's going to Yale to and everyone else of significance to the narrative is also going to good schools driving Molly into a bit of an existential crisis because she feels like she wasted her time and her life to make up for it,0.5382265
she needs to finally go to a high school party specifically the party being held by her bro a vice president Nick hilarity ensues like Molly I wasn't particularly pleasant in high school,0.15259396
and I harbored those same deep-seated judgments about people,0.23983206
I knew nothing about,0.0790934
some of the quote unquote popular girls who I looked at as dumb blondes you worked themselves to the bone to get straight A's and they went to Georgetown and Cornell and schools that you have probably heard of because they worked for him,0.7070832
and then some of them didn't work for it and still went to those schools,0.11364639
I didn't go to this schools if you've heard of my alma mater it may well be because the recent New York magazine article about the sex cult that was happening,0.43960354
it's now being turned into a movie by Mark Wahlberg,0.10388819
so yeah book-smart is a movie that a decade ago would have been a slap in the face that I've needed but not yet appreciated,0.44274777
I was kind of like Molly but with less ambition,0.14392677
so just me but for all of the things folks get judged for in this film and it is a lot there is significance in the one big thing that no one is judged for here that still inspires way too much,0.079534024
judgement everywhere Amy is gay so are other people,0.6689832
and it's fine blockers has this whole subplot around Sam's concerns that her sexuality will result in estrangement from her friends and family and while these fears turn out to be unfounded and it is an emotionally impactful arc,0.31089434
it's nice to see a story where a teen girl is out and has been for years,0.20247951
and so what dude although she is unsure if her crush Ryan feels the same that whole thing has played just as it would be in any other team comedy Chester regular do they like amis story and that is genuinely powerful a friend of mine posted on Twitter about how moving it was to see the queer gays in a mainstream film and though I can't really speak to that even I could see its significance,0.40338558
there are of course infinite darker timelines of the same events,0.0822641
and this is some kind of idealization and Amy's parents are Christians who aren't super psyched about the whole thing but they love their daughter regardless and that discomfort is played for comedy not drama and Holly freaking lujah for that it's not what this movie is about and as with everything else,0.37291285
amy is much more than her sexuality the corollary to stop making assumptions about other people is stop making things about,0.36776
and book smart is just as interested in that exploring it through the central friendship between Amy and Molly it is genuinely adorable how much the two clearly care for each other,0.06587158
and it's a little disheartening,0.068957716
how much Molly feels she needs to control Amy's life particularly disheartening for me because oh shoot I've been that - Amy is pretty content with the life that she has and has had Molly feels hers has been wasted and that by extension Amy's has to but she's projecting that hard Amy would have been happy staying home with her parents Pond errific congratulations feast but Molly wasn't gonna let that happen this all comes to a head in a truly beautiful moment that makes me really curious to see the film script because I want to know if it was presented as written or if that was a bold as,0.16189806
hell directorial,0.39411214
decision in either case I want to commend Olivia Wilde on what she has done,0.22526424
here actors trying their hand at directing can be something of a mixed bag but I can't think of many recent examples as confident as,0.068658106
wilds,0.05562802
it's almost shocking that this is a debut but that does seem to be another part of this new wave blockers was Kay cannons debut and the edge of seventeen Kelley Freeman Craig's and though their drama more than comedy eighth grade and Lady Bird were Bow Burnham's first feature and Greta Gerwig first solo effort respectively these new talents are bursting onto the scene with these amazing depictions of how people in general and girls in particular are coming of age in the modern world and it's wonderful so I'm genuinely saddened by the fact that book-smart underperformed opening weekend every time a good unique movie like this or say annihilation fails we get more live-action,0.09283035
Disney remakes films like book-smart need to succeed,0.35400382
so that this new era can flourish in the Hollywood System,0.056888737
but book-smart itself needs to succeed because it's a movie that people should see and whose lessons,0.20303723
we can all learn something from,0.079068206
well I will openly admit that I relate to Molly a bit too much for my liking and so her lessons were more explicitly mine damn near everyone has at least a little bit of that judgment inside and can get something valuable from the way book-smart breaks those judgments down and even if they don't it's freakin hilarious 29.0 out of ten,0.40331215
