the shape of water was directed by Guillermo del Toro and star Sally Hawkins Michael,0.027011111
Shannon Octavia Spencer and Doug Jones and is the story of a mute woman who,0.11903794
works at a science facility in the 1960s who encounters an aquatic creature it's been,0.027611108
captured it's being experimented on and something about this just doesn't sit right with her,0.031320173
she's also a woman who feels a little incomplete not just because she's not able,0.18979952
to speak but because she feels unfulfilled in her life as a result of that,0.07550566
her neighbor played by Richard Jenkins is an artist who also feels very unfulfilled and,0.009752258
can't seem to find his place in life and Hawkins and Spencer both play janitors,0.08592443
who clean this research facility so this gives them access to certain areas that they,0.024321109
normally wouldn't have access to that other government officials can only go in as a,0.02164308
result Hawkins starts to develop a relationship with this creature and we have a movie,0.06724607
now del Toro's last few films have disappointed me I wasn't a humongous fan of,0.047726262
Pacific Rim it was alright as an anime fan I should have loved that movie,0.048075482
and crimson peak I didn't really like it all and so going into the shape,0.02692863
of water I was excited based off of his knack for incredible visuals alone but,0.032387126
when I left I was impressed not just with the visuals but with the astounding,0.01851472
performances and that theme of being incomplete being unfulfilled because so many characters in this,0.022068132
movie feel that way even Michael Shannon as the evil villain the government official who,0.115477875
is torturing this creature and trying to learn from it even he doesn't feel like,0.20560494
he's reached his levels of greatness yet everyone in this film has something about them,0.037286203
that feels incomplete something that they haven't been able to attain or something they desire,0.044287927
and they need a void filled and for Sally Hawkins character this creature fills that,0.15539356
void because the creature doesn't understand the fact that she's mute they learned to communicate,0.16556089
through sign language and so he doesn't look at her as an incomplete person anymore,0.08791067
and this is one of the few people or things that she's ever encountered that,0.036277786
looks at her that way and so immediately she's taken aback by that so yes,0.02968781
it is a story about a woman and a weird fish monster and it's kind,0.23112707
of a love story which could be a little creepy for some people and kind,0.079658404
of a turn-off but it's not just about that it's about being unfulfilled in life,0.056990273
and how we can fill these voids in the people or things that we meet,0.15012729
it's brilliantly acted Sally Hawkins is terrific here and I think she deserves an Oscar,0.1498559
nomination honestly Richard Jenkins is also quite good as his Octavia Spencer Michael Shannon Michael,0.030356321
Stalberg everyone in this movie is giving top-notch work but let's talk about the visuals,0.030055657
because they leap off the screen this is a visual masterwork it's beautifully directed the,0.02077302
cinematography is a lush the colours explode off of the screen it's one of the,0.10253873
best looking films of the year by far and if it doesn't get nominated for,0.018928466
Best Cinematography I would be surprised this is a gorgeous gorgeous movie and del Toro,0.054654147
once again has proven that he has such a knack for beautiful production design and,0.03497602
choosing people to work in this set to make it look as best as it,0.07349348
can because so much of this movie is gratefully in-camera Doug Jones as this creature,0.0841903
the suit that he wears and all of that makeup and prosthetic work is beautiful,0.06537558
as for issues with the movie I would say towards the third act it gets,0.041611895
a little bit cheesy and a little predictable I could see where it was going,0.12837046
and it seemed like it ended at some point but then it continued to go,0.016811186
on some of the pacing is a little bit affected by a sort of strange,0.06950305
event that occurs and a side story that doesn't always live up to what the,0.006687756
rest of the film is doing and I could have used a little more time,0.014447789
at the facility building this relationship between Sally Hawkins and the creature because once certain,0.050585885
things happen it does feel a little rushed but besides that I think this is,0.026603354
a beautiful movie with one of Sally Hawkins best performances a great side plot with,0.038778875
Richard Jenkins that I did not expect that really says a lot about not just,0.033979576
the 1960s but unfortunately today as well and it's really powerful Octavia Spencer really good,0.03351062
Michael Shannon everybody in the film shines and instead of just falling back on Creature,0.027555898
from the Black Lagoon cliches it has a startling message about how we fill the,0.110915385
voids in our life and being unfulfilled as people and I thought it was really,0.09868864
