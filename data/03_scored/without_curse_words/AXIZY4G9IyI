to my core yeah sure honestly guys i'm kind of relating a bit too much,0.15118676
like i'm feeling a bit too much relating a bit too much to sadness and,0.105215356
like after some i've gone through i just know that you cannot say that to,0.14290462
someone because it just it's going to hurt them a lot more trying forcing themselves,0.4156658
to be happy trying to put a smile on their face it's just it's so,0.24220052
not good and it's so straining on that person their body and mind and i,0.51791674
i hate that i'm actually really connected to what this movie is trying to do,0.35288474
with joy being really pushy she honestly seems like the villain of this movie so,0.31089434
far okay i really like that song that like gentle music it's i don't know,0.101315916
why it's making me emotional like i'm preparing my body for what's gonna come you,0.35813642

is so sad and so hard to watch okay i don't know imagine being the,0.10840392
king of guys that's a core memory joy is legit the villain of this movie,0.22196019
like what the hell you're not in headquarters without you riley can't be happy honestly,0.7643899
i feel like you're describing depression she has no identity and no hap like no,0.18741167
way feeling happy because joy's gone her core personalities and everything is just gone that,0.08968017
is they have to be describing like depression or something there uh-oh she's looking at,0.17741036
us uh what did she say oh oh sorry sir no one was listening is,0.10704549
it garbage night uh we left the toilet seat up what what is it woman,0.669033

pilot well what i want to know more about that that's it go to your,0.07832509
room now foot is down the foot is down good job gentlemen that could have,0.15451476
been a disaster well that was a disaster oh my gosh this mom is legit,0.46617284
like not in this relationship right now she's not here for it okay that actually,0.14495046
hurts it's like she's losing a part of herself part for personality damn i'm relating,0.69884485
to this way too much it's actually hurting ugh that's sad why is this movie,0.1025831
just sad without even trying i mean it's probably trying if you want to walk,0.12750658
the long way go for it but riley needs to be happy i'm not missing,0.102174364
that train bing bong knows what he's doing he's part dolphin they're very smart joy's,0.19063838
a narcissist i just realized that she's like riley needs me like i know she,0.45603085
needs to be happy like but like you know what i mean she thinks a,0.086331494
lot too much about herself that is my favorite oh it's so soft oh let,0.088656075
me try hey what's the big idea you better fix that wall or else you're,0.091897056
invincible he just murdered somebody okay i like bing bong that's wow yeah i stashed,0.71364206
it in there for safekeeping and now i'm all set to take riley to the,0.07835515
moon he is destroying everything like all around him i would have sworn sparkle pony,0.39435178
mount was right here hey what's going on well yeah i i don't know princess,0.15130655
dream world oh the stuffed animal hall of fame oh oh they're tearing down her,0.31089434
old imaginations okay because it's old and she's growing up okay that's sad ah this,0.16541599
whole movie is just showing about growing up and like all the changes as we,0.06691321
can see in her mind her imagination being forgotten her memories being thrown away just,0.14045233
a lot of things changing oh gosh why does that make me so emotional once,0.11341673
we flew back in time we had breakfast twice that day see i love how,0.040320016
sadness is comforting sadness is like there's a use for her we were best friends,0.06341098
if you can't understand that pain yeah i can't connect with people no these facts,0.11225171
and opinions look so similar ah don't worry about it happens all the time that's,0.087499976
hilarious actually that that yeah how about we wake her up sadness that's ridiculous how,0.6330417
could we possibly how about we wake her up great idea jordan thanks come on,0.16277264
yeah narcissist joy is a narcissist we're gonna make her so happy she'll wake up,0.6364068
with exhilaration we'll excite her awake and that's never that's not possible if you're happy,0.45483202
in a dream you want to stay dreaming you just don't want to wake up,0.18830323
like i just wanted to sleep for 10 hours like i was not tired anymore,0.15569693
but i felt my dream made me feel happy so i stayed sleeping that is,0.07605809
terrifying that's really all you care about your friend is being locked up this looks,0.29569146
so cool i really like the way subconscious looks you know for a fact there's,0.06007409
like some badass thoughts down there in the subconscious it's broccoli is black looking that,0.36242965
terrifying i never hated this i actually usually always liked it candy wrappers why is,0.11272802
he in a clown jail with like balloons that's hilarious oh because there's a crowd,0.69542736
okay are kind of scary i mean i've never had an encounter with clowns i,0.5629669
wouldn't know i mean yeah i think like some clouds are scary like i feel,0.21945272
like people who make like some kinds of scary because they got a way to,0.17157571
be scary but i'm i don't know i have not i've not like had a,0.10611922
personal bad experience with the clown that you are making so much noise can you,0.69542736
not okay that's that is concerning okay that is creepy did you say birthday this,0.15013394
time is freaking me out i promise okay can you please stop no that's not,0.49691063
it was a dream this is ridiculous we can't even get a good night's sleep,0.5516392
anymore time to take action stupid mom and dad if they had moved us none,0.88824683
of this would have happened i'm like anger's character i like that he's taking control,0.14955091
and he's representing what would actually happen like the feelings and emotions that would you'd,0.056326684
feel in this situation stop you're hurting riley no no no i did it again,0.24164934
if you get in here these core memories will get sad i'm sorry riley needs,0.091265745
to be happy joy is really pissing me off like she's really the villain here,0.6364068
leaving sadness behind and stuff like that only focusing on herself and wanting to feel,0.17067823
happy oh my god this is pixar did such a good analogy with this okay,0.082059085
that has given me some avengers memories that that okay that scared me and it's,0.1803832
like your subconscious fear oh okay okay this is making me sad wow she used,0.25127348
to stick her tongue out when she was coloring it's feeling like someone died and,0.5154597
it's like just her memories but it's like feeling like a part of her diary,0.120641254
basically heard that she died and it's actually sad i don't like that three tears,0.2971225
came now oh my eyes burned now two tears came out bedtime i hate it,0.6604066
seeing those things fade away it just makes me sad it was the day the,0.08132344
prairie dogs lost the big playoff thing marley missed the winning challenge this is a,0.11118837
great thing about how happiness can only come once you like sadness after sadness and,0.1153683
like events like or it's just like it's yin yang they both have to come,0.0872722
together it balances out which is true all the time though if you're sad someone,0.09636191
will come and help you but that's not it's not always the case and that,0.06909525
sucks that really does okay gosh this is giving me way too much infinity vibes,0.80419457
i'm not this one i'm not liking it's giving me a lot of experiments oh,0.11138171
that's so heartbreaking take her to the moon for me okay why don't you fade,0.29852584
away like that just so not fair that is so not it's so not okay,0.11419964
this is shady as hell i feel worried for you just let me go riley's,0.40317354
better off without me coming oh my god why is that why is this movie,0.14974298
just hitting different like santa's being like let me go joey's better off without me,0.35999238
because you know when you're like sad or like depressed you're just like you just,0.5428886
wanted to go away you just want the sadness go away you want you want,0.34407625
to be happy it's legit this is this is the embodiment of that we can't,0.05286697
make riley feel anything oh that is that's terrible she is fully honestly she is,0.25990966
fully committed to the whole she's like the deepest sad she's depressed depressed ah poor,0.31089434
rally like feeling that at such a young age i don't think you printed enough,0.15208645
boyfriends that's okay i love that i love the dedication design for her yep loving,0.07566971
that and we don't support dying for something oh i wish joy was here kind,0.16297631
of dumb but i'm just saying in this movie's house well what would you do,0.7705989
if you're so smart i tell you but you're too dumb to understand what of,0.8606264
course your tiny brain is confused i love i like disgust like i like her,0.74045545
personality she seems like that sassy friend i think you're really kind of like mean,0.6414983
i don't know like could be bullying others but like she's not really like that,0.2020244
and she's not like a boy for you you know what i mean riley oh,0.35590968
we were worried sick where have you been it's so late okay i'm i'm liking,0.3179873
this so far the like ending and so i don't know i just feel like,0.08675851
pixar's gonna come out and just hit you but but okay wow okay this is,0.2911119
something a lot harder than i thought it would this is not okay i know,0.08899785
you don't want me to but i miss home i miss minnesota you need me,0.15210576
to be happy but i want my old friends and my hockey team i want,0.05950497
to go home please don't be mad i'm so glad she's talking to her parents,0.47786954
oh i'm glad that she's talking and they're being nice gosh why does pixar do,0.17970164
this to us in that song we heard in the beginning that like soft instrumental,0.05793117
oh it's going back again hey i'm liking this new view friendship island's expanded glad,0.09513537
they finally opened that friendly argument section i like tragic vampire romance island fashion island,0.111378886
oh everyone shut up boyband island hope that's just a phase say what you want,0.5540273
i think it's all beautiful i love that there you go i love that expanded,0.07505189
console is up she's um maturing and going through so more emotions expanded consoles guys,0.1171417
what's puberty yeah oh it's probably not important sorry okay i love that i love,0.25640565
that okay um wow tears came out of me with that one okay that was,0.12832744
something that was something i felt and dealt with with a lot of tears um,0.1367969
i really like inside out i really like what it teaches you and like what,0.17303266
it tells and like for people i don't know like i i can like emotionally,0.17060791
connect to it and pixar is just really great at doing that um i'm sorry,0.099219084
if i wasn't like as energetic and like funny and silly as i would be,0.64327264
during this commentary just like this movie i connect to it a little bit too,0.15415972
much and like i didn't i honestly did not know what to say sometimes and,0.084213465
like i didn't know what joke jokes to make or anything it was like i,0.10027036
was just like watching absorbing and i didn't want to like talk too much like,0.05767378
preaching this so that's why i was kind of like that um and it's like,0.08420655
late in the afternoon it's like what it's one and so i am um i'm,0.076927796
a little bit tired but i'm not like that tired but yeah i am um,0.15485403
yeah i think more people show attention in inside out it's it's a really good,0.15177663
movie and like as someone who's like been the press before that was like complete,0.16135447
that was such a good way to represent it like forcing happiness on top of,0.07161931
yourself like being like i need to be happy and hating sadness like hating sadness,0.445704
so much thinking it's so like useless and it's like why why do i feel,0.49077585
sad just like yeah and all the anger the fear to discuss that comes with,0.10471647
that like towards sadness and towards just everything that doesn't make you happy it's just,0.05898725
like so it's so true and i really like that and i really like like,0.061235677
at the end they like accept sadness and realize that sadness has like you need,0.082830206
it in your emotions you need to feel sadness like to feel empathy like with,0.15510245
helping bing bong like i mean my sense of empathy has grown but also because,0.17290911
of sadness the thing the things like i took for granted before things i loved,0.09131367
i loved even more like i loved tv before but now i love tv even,0.060965996
more not being able to feel the happiness that it once gave me and then,0.13381836
regaining that happiness i'm never gonna let that go and just like it just like,0.15190798
yeah i am not the same person i was a year ago but i like,0.0846704
this person i am now i like the videos i'm making on youtube that makes,0.29616547
me happy like all the people i'm connecting with with you so that makes me,0.16719571
happy i like continuing watching tv and trying and um applying for college to be,0.078635715
director applying for college is so hard and stressful so wish me luck with that,0.076566026
but yeah that's what i like inside out and i'm sorry this wasn't my like,0.10762477
giddy up happy video and like you're probably not gonna like it but like i'm,0.31700218
glad i watched it and said these things in front of the camera because at,0.07344617
least i said it in front of people instead of just thinking it so people,0.14945455
know how i feel whoever does watch this but i'm yeah anyway stop talking about,0.31089434
myself that was a good movie and like anyone who's feeling sad i should probably,0.10778118
