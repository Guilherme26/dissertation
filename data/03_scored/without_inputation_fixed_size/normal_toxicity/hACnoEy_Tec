a bit of doubt in regards to the cause of this man's death and was,0.18645608
it in fact planned for the sake of collecting the money especially when we take,0.0557782
a look at edward g robinson's character mr keys who happens to be walters boss,0.08658139

this specific situation and realize this may not be what it seems and because of,0.07078963
that it is eating up walters inside because he knows that he made a mistake,0.22532803

the true villain this movie was so interesting i mean it's amazing that this story,0.15175752
is no glamorous then something like a comedy it really isn't anything spectacular but the,0.10494237
way that these characters are portrayed the way that the directing is done the fact,0.053839725
that we have this incredible inner monologue which was then used again by billy wilder,0.11634962
in sunset boulevard in 1950 which would also become one of the most iconic stories,0.054518297
in filmmaking the fact that he just added these little things to his movie to,0.10554618

something so dark and disturbing is really what drives this film the characters play off,0.07787747
of each other beautifully fred mcmurray is fantastic barbara stanwick i have known this woman,0.36659497

one of the most incredible character actors and he played edward g robinson in that,0.051459353
film and he was brilliant but to actually see edward g robinson outside of the,0.07329823

fact that i was definitely in for something special does this movie have any negatives,0.05961581
well to a certain degree yes it's not necessarily a movie that is going to,0.052945424
be loved by everybody because especially with me where noir is very hit or miss,0.18506472
like i did not like la confidential but i loved chinatown you know so noir,0.1938676
really does bounce back and forth with me but i had a feeling that i,0.057330437
was gonna like this one but not everybody does like a noir or drama and,0.1128453
it's not a movie that everyone is going to love just because of the nature,0.07371585
of the story some people might just find it boring i mean there's not much,0.102528565
action and noir is very dialogue driven but it does have some very epic moments,0.10307766
that will definitely surprise you but i personally did enjoy this film as a whole,0.14555152
it is a movie that i would love to see again i don't know if,0.111169554
this is a movie that i'm going to own on dvd just because of the,0.09350536
fact that i don't see myself watching it as much as movies like the apartment,0.08459331
and some like it hot but to be frank with you guys i'm sort of,0.5154597
50 50 at this point in time and i wouldn't be surprised if i actually,0.080648236
found it at a good price somewhere online or in target or something like that,0.10201479
i wouldn't be surprised if i actually picked myself up a copy of this film,0.13989487
