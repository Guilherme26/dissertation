hello and welcome to the flick advisory today we're going to review Logan now Logan,0.032650538
is directed by james mangold Logan is said to be the final portrayal of the,0.024657028
character Wolverine by Hugh Jackman this is the ninth time he's played the character I'm,0.017884128
starting with 2000s x-men action was really the first time at least 20 Century Fox,0.07636841
kind of took the comic book movie seriously x-men kind of redefine the comic book,0.049284786
genre they're the first ones who really put a lot into the comic book movies,0.05579893
I've seen they could actually be more than just silly comic book movies if you,0.19716243
go back to that first x-men that I protection actually touched a lot about the,0.13495845
political and social issues I'm all being under the veil of mutants versus people but,0.05114597
the whole movie is really a civil rights movie you know if you think about,0.03161152
civil rights communes so starring hugh jackman Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X Xavier and,0.05478918
introducing Daphne keen as Laura I'm also knows x-23 hey why not okay x-23 is,0.028693361
a clone of Wolverine that they got wrong 22 times then they decided to try,0.073115654
to make it a female you know playing around the chromosomes and filing the 23rd,0.12306031
attempt to make a Wolverine clone it works oh I can't much like you know,0.0460041
one of the things you want to take note is that this movie is loosely,0.037313476
based off of the the comic book old man Logan it's loosely based because there,0.096449636
are elements that the movie can't take away from the soy and then the elements,0.028876288
of the movie doesn't take away from that particular story that story has the all,0.008926764
the Marvel now all of a model but that story has Marvel elements and Marvel,0.03394166
properties that 20 accessory box cannot use such as the whole Hawkeye those things belong,0.023320008
to Marvel Studios you know in their original series and stuff like that and so,0.04726928
20th Century Fox took the old man Logan feel and adapted it into a story,0.057936165
that they could actually use with their properties I'm so you know there is no,0.018828023
Wolverine finding the hoax you know children those things don't happen in this sir there's,0.1125657
no blind Hawkeye driving wolverine around so in that sense is there an immediate adaptation,0.054833747
of old man Logan it's more of a rethinking or loosely based off of that,0.064045876
so here you have Logan he's an old man he's an old man you know,0.20039722
imagine you know Charles Xavier now a really old man this matter of fact he's,0.07807261
kind of going see now he's got dementia or Alzheimer's he has a degenerative you,0.32926938
know the kind of brain disease here and Logan is taking care of him they,0.32120374
have so like a father-son relationship almost all the other x-men are gone they kind,0.124350764
of a little to a reason about why that's happening we'll get into that later,0.03931435
so it's really just Xavier and Logan full of full majority the movie until lower,0.07704224
comes along Laura needs help getting to this other place with these other kind of,0.04204892
upcoming mutants are like a safe haven for them anytime you are come on come,0.073015876
on everyone has come along now a lot of the things in this move we,0.024167452
work really really well as talk about those things the direction in this movie the,0.028841699
tone they decide to take this is a this be first rated our x-men movie,0.038044512
are you can say Deadpool if you want through Dipple is a raid on comic,0.2552114
book movie and he is kind of an excellent Your Honor me but this is,0.09236474
actually something that we've been waiting for for a long time it was nice to,0.023153048
see Wolverine on the screen back in two thousand it was just it was just,0.037592854
a neat thing and it has been cool ever since but you kind of wanted,0.06621903
a little bit more you kind of want of the edginess of that particular character,0.07797549
to really come through and they tried it a little bit before with 2013 the,0.06406716
Wolverine with james mangold also directed it tries to bring you a more ground in,0.05584882
a more serious a more mature wolverine character and after the release of Deadpool which,0.010737394
was rated r 20 Century Fox decided they could take a chance and tell a,0.030306432
more mature adult Wolverine story and so here they had to take that and run,0.043658
with it at a rated r level and for that the movie doesn't hold back,0.016449327
and let me give you everything you something we've been waiting to see you know,0.059329726
for the last what 17 years you know when Wolverine you know stab somebody you're,0.3140662
selected that somebody with this cause you know finally actual blood comes out hey you,0.11881444
know it's not that clean clip they clean cut album you know what would you,0.12193216
slice it you cut all right of the wound at the exact same time we,0.25513268
got to a point where I was almost like insulting our intelligence so we finally,0.16118996
get the blood on this and another thing this movie just hurts there's movie physically,0.18698977
and emotionally hurts they bring you along with these characters you know you've already known,0.03107472
you know Wolverine Logan you already know professor extra now you get to really spend,0.021621129
a lot of time with them because it's mostly them before the other x-men movie,0.054109365
here you're sharing screen time with real storm Jean Grey rogue you know Cyclops do,0.05740269
you know all these other characters finally we get to sit down with really the,0.06697535
characters we've enjoyed the most and to spend time with them and fill for them,0.02368453
and let them take you along the ride if some when bad things happen to,0.046374608
them and there's allows bad things that haven't told in this movie when bad things,0.02254773
happen to him you'd get there and it hurts you it is sort of an,0.08204907
emotionally draining movie almost like I said with my princess review as even as a,0.10864112
movie you're just high you need somebody to help you out of the seat because,0.072361335
you're exhausted and it's a good thing I mean it's effective storytelling it's good acting,0.050501406
it's a good direction I was good writing Hugh Jackman against us as well he's,0.053497396
got to know this role by the bathroom you know like the back of his,0.06544808
hand by at this point you know plane is character nine different times but he,0.012510774
actually brings it to a whole nother level this time because Wolverines out of place,0.07353272
in his life that he hasn't been before there's no more glitz and glamour there's,0.06573478
no more team even though he wasn't the biggest team players there's no real team,0.021969685
to fall back on none of that is just hear my professor actually trying to,0.02352156
take care of them and Professor X you know Charles Xavier and you know Patrick,0.053780764
Stewart playing him again gives another outstanding performance um he's an old man even-even older,0.10205115
man he's beginning to go see now so but you know somebody who hazards of,0.04317441
you know uh who's going through this you understand what a bad day is for,0.09669575
them you know they don't remember you were you trying to tell them hey you,0.02689537
know this happened back in the day they're like I'll remember that but no when,0.01389236
Charles Xavier has a bad day you know with the mind that he has when,0.07508726
that mine such a deteriorate it's not just a bad day for him that's a,0.06578334
bad day for everybody in like a five-mile radius when I try to think about,0.046062637
things that don't work in this movie I really I nothing really comes across you,0.06884651
would think maybe the thing you know the child actor Daphne King you'll think maybe,0.074332274
you know sushi or the one below and the movie she works really well she,0.059335712
gives things across a lot of times without dialogue you do believe her as this,0.04710365
savage now know now you know somebody confronts her you're kind of expecting they might,0.33192658
have something for her but nah nah you know when she goes off she goes,0.039632306
off and then Wolverine almost almost have to catch up to her you know because,0.029697789
you know it's his movie too so no she absolutely does a great job as,0.05201869
well I really had a tough time thinking anything bad about this movie in any,0.055187628
kind of points to dr. down and really the only thing i have i have,0.10848281
two things i kind of wish they had they wish they had expounded upon one,0.2632217
and movies Wolverine sick you know he's not healing i wish they kind of told,0.121148564
you hate this is what's wrong with them this is like not healing this is,0.051484548
returning them but they take the mature they make they take the more mature well,0.05399362
you know you know it gives full out of Schilling and they kind of allude,0.041456904
to it and they say hey take that for what it is and run with,0.017668609
it and also what happens to the rest of the accident you know in the,0.06512414
movie it's Caliban Wolverine and Professor X and there's no other mutants really the speaker,0.0613745
and you wonder what will happen to the other mutants weapon to the x-men once,0.15514743
again they allude to it they tell you how you know just this is probably,0.021778112
what happened here but we're not saying it definite when I'm saying in indefinite terms,0.017262181
I again at the moment shear out I understanding your audience is talking about all,0.026259454
the time you know like things you know spoon-fed to you I kind of wished,0.23040919
they have spoon fed me this one but I can live with it it's the,0.06421351
more mature around it's good storytelling I get it because this movie is essentially 17,0.027504014
years of the making I have to give it a night out of 10 this,0.051381446
is something we've been waiting for for a long long time they finally delivered it,0.013904999
to us in a near perfect package it's like when we first seen the spider-man,0.06211618
in in civil wars like this is what we've been waiting for and so that's,0.06700528
why spider-man stole that show we learn that whole movie this Logan is what we've,0.1801171
been waiting with you know excellent fan comic book fans have been waiting for for,0.028731942
a long time and they gave it to us and uh nicely wrapped bowl so,0.02566478
what do you think of Logan do you think maybe it was too sad you,0.023848165
think those two series for a comic book movie do you believe that this has,0.017779028
to do with Deadpool success let me know in the comments please hit the like,0.037091304
button subscribe and more reviews coming to you I took a quick break because I,0.07039439

it was hurting I want to get into it away so Logan nine out of,0.11821245
