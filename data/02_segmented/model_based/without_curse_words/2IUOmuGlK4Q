"Peter Parker, you're out, Miles Morales"
You are definitely in Spider-man Into the Spider Verse is probably one of 2018 s most anticipated films
"So does it deliver? In this one, the villain inadvertently opens up a whole bunch of dimensions, and all kinds of Spider-man come in to Miles Morales dimension, and they're all stuck there"
That's the whole story
"Now, They need to get back before they die or disappear or whatever it does, because they're not in their own dimension"
"And before Miles Morales is Chris, reality crumples and destroys"
Have you seen any of the trailers? The animation looks a lot like a comic book
It almost has this 3d feel to it because you have some of the color shifting in the backgrounds and then you also have a lot of halftone going on
And so it really makes it feel super like you're in a comic book and I loved it at the beginning
"I thought I was going to not like it so much because some of the colour shifts really messed with my eyes, But it was in the background enough that it didn't you know"
"I noticed it, but it wasn't my focal, and so I thought Yeah, okay, it looks like it's totally 3d like I'm gonna wear 3d glasses and then it's gonna have all of this depth"
"No, it was just truly to make it more and more like an actual comic book"
"The movie itself is visually stunning, but also without being overwhelming to your eye, I mean, there is a lot going on in several scenes, especially that climax where there are a whole lot of colors and there's just a whole lot of action going on"
"And really, you could just kind of get blurry eyed, and like you know, go cross-eyed but I run"
the
"The filmmakers really did a good job of animating it in a way that still you were able to keep your focus and know what you're supposed to see, and as the other things happen in the background, they don't draw it away, but they certainly had to it"
"It's a great story, and I love how they intro the other Spider people, because they give us some background without delving too deep, so that we have enough knowledge of who they are and what they're about and their kind of backstory and how they are in their universe, but it doesn't spend a whole lot of time on it"
"I felt like I had a well-rounded just grasp on who each one was, enough to care about them, but not so much that it becomes their movie or their the focal point"
I think one of the best things about the movie ins
One of the things that I liked the most is that it has a such a great message and it really is all about team
"And it was a positive team message throughout much of the film and I really appreciated that because it's you know, sometimes you have all of these ego things going on or you know somebody's gonna be"
"No, No, I'm the best or whatever it is"
"This though wasn't that way? they were all working towards a common purpose, a common goal and they were building each other up and really supporting each other And I appreciated that a lot"
"There's some good humor, but it is also enough tension and drama in there to really keep me going Engage throughout the entire thing"
It really felt like an animated live-action comic book that doesn't make any sense right
"That is a total contradiction in terms, but that's what it is"
"It's just, I mean, if you think about it, it's obviously it's an animated film and then it has this comic-book ask part to it, But the characters themselves were so real, not realistic, not photo realistic in the Cgi or though the way that they made them, but just that they had heart and they had depth to them, and I cared about them, And so that is why they made it like they just seemed real to me"
So there it is a live-action animated comic book
"You know, The movie is one hour and 57 minutes, which is actually kind of long for an animated feature, but for this I didn't feel it at all"
"I was totally engaged the entire time, and I think had they made it shorter, I probably would have been disappointed"
"Know, are there parts that are predictable? Yes, of course there are, but the whole movie itself was so enjoyable and I liked the story so much and the characters that I'm willing to overlook some of these parts that I saw coming, because I just I was so enthralled in what was going on Overall"
"I think Spider-man into the Spider Verse is a great film and I think it's one that everybody can enjoy, not just fans of superhero movies, or like the Uber niche fans of just Spider-man I really think that it has something to offer to everybody"
"I mean, it is great animation"
There's good humor
There's great voice work and just the the overall look and the feel is so well put together and it is so good and tight that it is just it's a visual spectacle that I think you should see
There's no sex or nudity
There is a little bit of language and some animated violence
"I give Spider-man into the Spider Verse, five out of five couches"
