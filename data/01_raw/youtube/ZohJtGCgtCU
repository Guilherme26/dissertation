hello everyone look to the Freestyle I'm Scott this week we wouldn't saw history itself of course talking about salma one dream can change the world taglines selma directed by ava davern be starring david o yellow Wendell Pierce and tim roth and basically it's the story of martin luther king as he tried to go to Selma to fight for equal rights and add chronicles his campaign to secure equal voting rights and the march that took place from selma to montgomery alabama in 1965 this program I trying to talk about things that I liked and didn't like about the movie and I'm just going to go right off and say there was nothing I didn't like about this movie as far as likes I mean it's very powerful was very emotional the message is something that you can immediately get behind the acting is perfect the cinematographer work is perfect it's honestly maybe one of the best movies i've seen in a long time it's very powerfully it moved me honestly like it's very good i would say that i wish i had more to say but there's not much to say about it it's it's good and this is the part where i would usually try and break this thing usually doing a 1 through 5 i'm not going to rate this movie it can't really be rated it's not something that was just some story they came from some humans mind i mean this was history it was made by all humans and it it deserves to be heard it demands to be seen this is something that i think everyone should go out and see see however you can see it you should see it I was never taught any of this in school the first time I ever heard the name selma was what i saw the trailer had no idea about any of this and i think a lot of people are going same boat as me and it's gonna it's gonna give you something to think about though it definitely it's I give you something to think about and the whole broad scope of everything it's it's very powerful very good but that's going to do it for our review this week um you know all the normal stuff I say click stuff type stuff that kind of stuff next week groans the American sniper which also seems to be another great we got all these great movies lined up it's been a really good start to the new year so far and I hope to see you next weekend and have a good weekend
