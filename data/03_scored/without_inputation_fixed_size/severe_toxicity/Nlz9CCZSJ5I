"one of those movies, whose fresh subject matter, unique structure, and well-crafted filmmaking made it",0.019344205

emotionally torn-up characters. Centered around three pivotal moments in the life of a young black,0.12576494

black men. The film follows its protagonist Chiron from boyhood through young adulthood in the,0.16232543

"filmmaking in Moonlight is extremely subjective to Chiron’s experience. Jenkins doesn’t just tell his story,",0.021887869
he makes us feel it. Film is an incredibly effective medium for exploring a character’s,0.030739466
"perspective, using the same tools that create the illusion of reality. This happens more directly",0.04177287
when a film cuts from a character’s face to a shot of what they’re seeing.,0.03930903
"But it can be more subtle as well, using cuts to flashes of a memory",0.053329103
"as it intrudes on the present, or camera movements to emphasize a character’s internal feelings.",0.008512355
"In Moonlight, Jenkins harnesses everything from the shots and the mise-en-scene to the editing and",0.19602697

"and guidance, and Juan, played with grace and moral heft by Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali, steps",0.05216104
"into that void. He really sees Chiron, without pity and without judgement, and teaches him",0.0667871

"we understand the competing desires in Chiron’s head — he wants to join Juan, but",0.032425042
is desperate not to make himself vulnerable. Once he’s in the water and Juan is,0.017213622
"teaching him how to swim, the filmmaking turns subjective again, jump-cutting between shots as Chiron",0.122471616
gets the hang of it and even begins to enjoy himself. It’s almost as if,0.08244353
"he’s been freed from the long takes, along with his hesitance. Jenkins is also underlining",0.036525898
"the fact that Juan isn’t just teaching Chiron to swim, he’s showing him how to",0.023440406
"take charge of himself, how to keep himself afloat. Juan is giving him the confidence",0.028526401

"opposite of the harsh, violent depiction drug dealers often get in mainstream films. And second,",0.07071567
black Americans have historically been systematically and disproportionately not given opportunities to learn how to,0.40277788
"swim. As is so often the case in Moonlight, the filmmakers are taking on more",0.025036182
"than one stereotype at a time. Now, a film’s style can often be broken down",0.026865438
into two rough categories: realism and formalism. Realism refers to a style in which cinematic,0.03743986
"techniques like shots, cuts, mise-en-scene, and sound are meant to be as unobtrusive as possible.",0.0661146
"The whole idea is that the filmmaking tools go largely unnoticed by the audience, allowing",0.017806966
"the story and characters to take center stage. Formalism, on the other hand, is a",0.011259563
style in which those techniques clearly and deliberately alter our perception of the film’s reality.,0.012669087
"Things like slow motion or reverse photography, obvious manipulation of the film’s sound or color",0.013277066
"scape, discontinuity editing, and using jump cuts or repeated shots. These techniques all draw attention",0.117454804
"to themselves. In formalist films, the form takes precedence over the content. Think about the",0.03596382
"wild, operatic camerawork and editing of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull. Or the curated, almost caricatured",0.10313539
worlds created by Wes Anderson in films like Moonrise Kingdom or The Grand Budapest Hotel.,0.0059893136
"While some films lean heavily into one style or the other, most mainstream movies contain",0.027443482
elements of both. And Moonlight is no exception. Jenkins captures much of Chiron’s experience with,0.01423626
realist techniques. Handheld shots follow Chiron as a young boy as he runs away from,0.10884733
his tormentors. Natural lighting fills the scene when Juan finds him sitting outside his house.,0.042356897
"The movie cuts traditionally back and forth between a teenage Chiron and his mother Paula,",0.010996151
"fiercely portrayed by Naomi Harris, as she demands money during her tragic downward spiral into",0.032202207
"drug addiction. In these moments, Jenkins tries to keep the filmmaking out of the way,",0.10544292
to give us a sense of being there in the room with the action and,0.020326016
watching it unfold. But then – especially at pivotal emotional moments – the film moves,0.023997165
"into a much more aggressively formalist style. As a teenager, at least one other kid",0.084862135
"seems to get Chiron and has known him for years. Kevin, played by Jharrel Jerome,",0.01463271
presents himself as confident and gregarious. He’s as at home in his own body and,0.07785775

"on Kevin’s shoulder. Chiron’s hand grips the sand, and Nicholas Britell’s wondrous score takes over.",0.053504046
"Again, the movie is challenging how cinema usually presents black American men, usually macho or",0.05522554
"brutal — but not vulnerable. Here, Chiron and Kevin open up to one another, sharing",0.065173365

"of his film, masterfully drawing us into his character’s heart and mind. It’s an especially",0.03295453
smart decision given how interior the film is. Jenkins uses many of the tricks of,0.02290826
cinema to help us understand Chiron’s constant struggle to reconcile his identity with the world,0.027210003
"around him. And it’s his struggle to be himself, a gay black man in America,",0.58681065
"that drives the emotional narrative of the film. Cinema scholar J. Ken Stuckey argues that,",0.010954244
“masculinity in its various forms is the main antagonist of this film. One of the,0.06371062
most difficult aspects of being gay is the way in which one’s sexuality can telegraph,0.10161412

"other boys his age, all playing a makeshift soccer game in the movie’s first part.",0.03344876
The camera gives us Chiron’s point of view as the boys stare at him –,0.037499063

"fact, among those boys it’s only Kevin who truly sees Chiron as a person, rather",0.07077421
than some kind of “other” to be made fun of. And when Kevin and Chiron,0.032107748
"wrestle on the ground, Jenkins revels in their connection. The film takes its time with",0.05152712
"this moment, giving us dislocated shots of their hands and legs, bodies grappling with one",0.4834315
another. They seem somehow both trapped and free. It’s a powerful visual metaphor for Chiron’s,0.023910027
central struggle — pushing and pulling against the expectations of his community and the stereotypes,0.02932728
attached to his gender and sexual identity. And it sets up what’s to come. As,0.24799624
"an adult, in the third part of the film, Chiron’s taken on so many signifiers",0.023330651
"of traditional masculinity, he’s almost unrecognizable. In addition to his muscles, he wears gold grills",0.12080267

at us. And at himself. So there’s no denying that Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight is as,0.021253282
thoughtful as it is elegant and compassionate. You might appreciate it as an exquisite coming-of-age,0.036007054
story told in a unique way. Or as an exercise in how formalist cinematic techniques,0.02511534
