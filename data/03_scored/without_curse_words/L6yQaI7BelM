let's talk about this movie this movie takes place in the 70s where we find,0.10072821
a young black detective named Ron stalwart who infiltrates and exposes the Ku Klux Klan,0.057748444
ladies and gentlemen we had a Mission Impossible movie without Tom Cruise let's talk about,0.1682133
this script I got mixed feelings about this script because there's things that I love,0.079629004
and there's a lot of that I hate it I love the truth behind this,0.40321958
script I loved how they were able to transition most of the truth over and,0.052047104
present it to me I hate it they added BS to fill in Lord knows,0.6041476
what then the reason why I hated it because it was obvious it's like not,0.18673956
that Najee what no this movie I know the difference I watch a lot of,0.08851312
film I know and I hate it the fact that they say they should have,0.36644167
just kept it 100 if you say Oh movies based on a true story then,0.039845213
worth word scene for scene needs to be true and they didn't do that they,0.071489915
added bits of it which sort of just as I just said this movies based,0.10871322
on true events these are actual characters in real life doesn't the guy live by,0.084336296
Ron stall where this is what he is and this is what a David Duke,0.1685055
looks like you know I mean these are the characters I would have enjoyed that,0.10028854
perspective then giving me a true story because you can look at him like nah,0.14935374
that's wack let's talk about the cast I'm only going to mention two characters Adam,0.15007816
driver John David Washington hey lied dude 3 Topher Grace Topher Grace first let me,0.44664115
give you the good in the bad the good Adam driver that connect he's I,0.14587253
think he's a very underrated actor because of Star Wars and people were not really,0.12356392
speaking on him but I've seen him in a couple of our roles and Adam,0.08638907
driver knocks it out the park every time I really enjoy seeing him in this,0.17916675
movie he played a undercover detective named Flip Zukerman and he was Jewish but you,0.17481093
know how some people you grow up Jewish but you don't grow up Jewish that's,0.5061249
your religion that's where you're from that's when you that's what you are but you,0.15172182
don't push it is like being Christian Laudes people Christian but they don't push it,0.42718473
and I really enjoyed seeing him cuz he played the opposite ron Stallworth he was,0.13205141
the white guy who when it was time to face to come face to face,0.5912772
with the Ku Klux Klan member that's what they that's what he sent and I,0.31026533
think he did a hell of a good job and it really showed me his,0.40339485
acting chops topher I think did a decent job but he's Eric Foreman and everything,0.14511019
he does my gosh he's Eric Foreman and everything he does my he has not,0.20468782
changed one bit every time I see him I think of read from that 70,0.15174866
show every tyronn ik for his movies in the 70s John David Washington this is,0.16095738
the first time I seen him in anything and I'm have to say this he,0.20951766
sucked in his movie I'm gonna give her another chance though it's the first time,0.76008993
I seen him but he sucked in his movie his voice was annoying as he,0.8604477
was corny as his costume design was wack as and his jokes were wack as,0.36017323
overall he was wack as I didn't I couldn't understand it I was like why,0.12505138
how what I'm like don't stop it aah whack aah he sucked in this movie,0.6705157
and it hurt because he was the star of the movie I'm watching him over,0.18728976
and over just sound corny his voice was so annoying and it was at a,0.7309933
point that we accept and we were like is he doing this on purpose and,0.05316981
then we we went and looked it up on you oh my god he sounds,0.10798965
like that there's parts of this movie that really make this movie bad and let's,0.15725617
just say his voice he sucked make him another chance though my semen something knows,0.9264658
this was not a movie for him I could nah nah nah he sucked in,0.66724956
his movie man if Adam driver wasn't in this film I would I had a,0.17106959
horrible time he sucked his everything up it just was bad he was bad let's,0.8060606
get on other parts the directing Spike Lee does a spike Lee joint yo Spike,0.14740403
Lee on a directors perspective did good but because it's Spike Lee I'm not gonna,0.117579296
give you that good credit you did bad because you know there's certain elements of,0.123535156
this movie that Spike Lee just refused to capture and regardless of the movie Colin,0.09359848
called Black Klansmen showing the Ku Klux Klan and then show the Black Panther black,0.31089434
power on it all that good stuff he refused to make this movie feel black,0.44972473
it didn't even feel white this movie had no culture to it it's showed us,0.3043717
as a director when you see certain scenes where black people were being abused black,0.7342945
people are are coming together in spirit hopes and hopeful spirit and they're joining forces,0.051339626
for better cause and you see the racist cops trying to destroy that saying hateful,0.6185828
things you're supposed to feel some type of way when you hear the word uh,0.072192915
what's to call it pick a nanny or something like that with the little pig,0.62928057
oh you just wrecked me you know I mean you're supposed to you're supposed to,0.4934555
rekt me when you hear the black people coming together my god they put Harry,0.70736206
Belafonte in his movie y'all know him Harry Belafonte had all the bad more for,0.1652979
the back and a Carmen Jones I know but anyway you're supposed to fill him,0.15328114
when he sits on that charity talks Spike Lee did a poor job I didn't,0.1426243
feel anything didn't didn't didn't get emotional didn't we didn't even have the pride you,0.100147136
know when when when his movie based on some stories so obviously the the Ron,0.1004839
Ron actually survived and one for the team but you didn't feel it and as,0.070529915
a director Spike Lee did not deliver he sucked at that too I know this,0.52450943
is gonna sound up but this is the truth keeping their sheep on honey would,0.22006488
you be sighs Corey Hawkins y'all know him dr. Dre it's better come the black,0.69692075
actors sucked in this movie they weren't believable the costume designs were corny the afros,0.7213981
look like wigs the clothes the way they dance their vibe it did not mesh,0.15234149
well but the white actors will out of all ones in this scene we were,0.44612697
like man I selling races in a my gosh they did their part but don't,0.28890198
black actors oh sucked they did not feel authentic and it hurt because I didn't,0.80164856
build the black coming off of them I felt young actors trying to make away,0.65871453
and it hurts this movie terribly the casting sucked and the directing sucked because all,0.8233925
this was supposed to happen you gotta remember you can see it visually but I,0.04386589
don't mean you feel it yeah I mean we watch a lot of movies out,0.09595236
here you can see a get his head blown off boom clean off but a,0.3605561
director and good acting make you feel it oh up you know I'm saying you,0.089209884
can see a hospital scene somebody dying on a dead oh we're good acting and,0.2409287
directing make your village uh-huh you don't die oh he coming back he's dead Lassie,0.57408607
you can see it it's there directly to make you feel it ah you know,0.06378339
I'm saying they drop the ball on that the or the the music Spike Lee,0.10716161
literally tried to go back to like old-school Spike Lee with the music and he,0.15178329
did not mesh well with these actors the music was poor ah I was tired,0.16557652
of singing it was Ron start-stop Star Wars had a scene every time you hadn't,0.09644681
seen it was a certain song for him like staff or something but it wasn't,0.06044472
not don't take it like doodoo doodoo don't take it like that but it was,0.08419184
more of a you know every time he had his scene it was that that,0.14914677
that music that played with play them play with him I was annoyed you should,0.14917372
remind me of school days and like it was like stop it was like do,0.16325
the right thing he was like stop I was like Michael Max is like stop,0.17893957
brothers stop stop stop aah he killed me and then he did that one shot,0.6575365
you know when Spike Lee and you they move forward but this up enough pro,0.07591979
and cons the movie has great elements to it visually it doesn't hold up to,0.04697566
certain points the white cast it holds up the black cast it doesn't directing Spike,0.3019274
Lee did good but because of Spike Lee I'm not not freak that you did,0.31089434
bad I was expecting more from Spike especially on a piece like this when you,0.18590407
see Spike Lee and he did Malcolm X mmm one of the most powerful scenes,0.078377195
at our whole movie Rickman brings tears my just thinking about [Applause] that's too much,0.08764827
powerful one man he did the pick on he moved and that wake up was,0.11181561
like man and not one not one minutes how I know I know not we,0.1551795
gotta do something I felt it but anyway I hold you up for that kind,0.15827583
of seat cuz that shit's mmm based on some story right did based on true,0.8606264
story right when believable this one with um let's rate this thing black Klansmen has,0.34568828
good elements but has a lot of bad elements but I really did appreciate the,0.12969185
story I appreciate it mostly actors what hurts that the most is the costume design,0.08569313
the directing and the star John Washington not being believable to me personally to me,0.1446583
I'm gonna give black Klansmen a c-minus because that's good trace but it also has,0.24035954
a lot of bad ones and it leaves you questioning the script like why would,0.24099453
you write that I know you added the end but why why is this why,0.09192698
is that really hurts the movie I hope you guys enjoyed the real thumbs this,0.15428022
