played by a Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein who coincidentally is Jonah Hill's real-life sister,0.10401277
so yeah similar but like I said both films and actual execution style and real,0.13565223
plot couldn't be more different super bad is really a wild ride about two best,0.055521548
friends dealing with the fact of growing apart from one another Seth feeling that he's,0.019750632

about two best friends who realize that while they spent highschool only worrying about their,0.035005953
grades and extracurricular activities to get as far ahead in life as possible throwing parties,0.06325364

Amy are gonna get an entire four years of debauchery and one night at one,0.26839837
party listen it is very important that you keep the safety the first thing I,0.070115015
need to talk about in regards to book smart and how much this movie works,0.047913842
is in its dialogue the film's biggest success in my personal opinion the credit there,0.010162011
certainly goes to the film's writers comprised of Emily Halpern Sara Hoskins Susannah Fogle and,0.014457101
Katie Silverman a lot of media revolving teens has this thing where the characters in,0.027196698
question always seem kind of fake the main culprit behind this is what I call,0.064150974
teen speak you have 40 year old men writing teen dialogue and how they think,0.08821067
teenagers talk is definitely not Riverdale is not the problem it's gonna take you to,0.03525407

teens their conversations don't feel forced for the sake of making a movie and hitting,0.100190625
plot points while trying to sound hip I read that this movie went under many,0.039531864
on the fly rewrites director Olivia Wilde yes that Olivia Wilde told her cast that,0.07245446
if a piece of dialogue didn't seem authentic that they should improvise it in a,0.042868424
way that did and I gotta say they succeeded on all fronts Molly and Amy,0.04455134
feel so real because they are they aren't contrived teens written by how chad chattington,0.063781135
thinks his daughter acts they're carefully created four dimensional girls made by many funny women,0.14858672
the two funniest Molly and Amy these two girls really seem like best friends the,0.10517351
chemistry between them is fantastic a lot of credit here belongs to different Feldstein as,0.058056563
they really helped create these two with the improv dialogue as mentioned previously wild ask,0.034016162
these two to live together in order to develop a wrapper between them and they,0.08847076
did for ten weeks they live together and this experience definitely shines through in the,0.009516782
film no but we lived together during the movie and it was the greatest time,0.023334643
filled with snacks and pancakes and sleeping until 2:00 p.m. because we would get home,0.065267816
at 6:00 a.m. because we would start our days at 6:00 p.m. because we had,0.051304284
night shoots well one could argue that Devers amy is the classic quote unquote straight,0.250177
man to felt stains goofball it's really not the case both do amazing work in,0.27316502
making both Amy and Molly have their moments and not file under any specific trope,0.03598976
because we were so prepared when we got there we were able to have so,0.0128333885
much fun because we knew exactly who our characters from you know exactly the story,0.013390147
we were telling we knew the lines we knew the day and we could just,0.012836714
be free and actually really enjoy it yeah and it was also great to get,0.029329278
to do that with you I feel like sometimes your passion doesn't really match with,0.09761437
the passion of the other actor on the film that you're doing but beany and,0.05866853
I both came at it with with so much passion and drive and love for,0.040876865
these two girls and we both had a deep understanding knowing that we had to,0.045867074
get this dialogue exactly right because this movie relies on it and they're always matched,0.032878034
always together yeah another reason book-smart is so great as in this one a teeing,0.091559865
of the typical teen stereotype the popular kids aren't just dumb jocks and pretty girls,0.35161343
they're real people too last a present for my favorite team Jared you're not my,0.05605436
student I've heard great things and hey everybody else got their graduation guess right come,0.025839059
on Jer bear coming at you from all angles right nobody asked for that big,0.100831866
me little over me well baby jar at the bottom the supporting cast is so,0.10813292
well written too compared to most any other high school comedy I mean book smarts,0.13881053
plot is kick lined because Molly realizes that her classmates aren't the one-dimensional idiots that,0.59053135
she thought there were many moments and interactions throughout the 105 minute runtime where we,0.02536944
see that these other students aren't just cheap characters even the typical theater kids are,0.04965995
written and played so genuinely and not for a cheap gag or punchline that it,0.10444248
really makes you feel for these characters Shakespeare in the Park gang what we will,0.04441631
be performing the Bart's comedies as modern tragedies outside Whole Foods across town was actually,0.028796466
funny it's what we did in my summer program last year in Barcelona when I,0.04083496
lived in because of this book smart really gets you and it immerses you in,0.06850926
this high school experience honestly with it being one of the best depictions in media,0.024907801
not everything though can be without fault and book-smart does become a little dazed ex,0.08904149
machina towards the end but so do most comedies so I can't really fault it,0.040564895
too much for that but certain situations are either gotten out of her avoided seemingly,0.04581319
with no problem at all I don't want to go into specifics due to supply,0.023415795
their reasons but I'm sure those who have seen this film know what moments I'm,0.027500687
referring to and don't get me wrong this film isn't cheapened at all by these,0.06938065
moments it doesn't have validate anything it just happens to be slightly upsetting when this,0.041538723
film has been doing most everything else perfectly the biggest triumph of book-smart is in,0.053257264
its representation this is a movie written by four women directed by a woman starring,0.14885214
women all of which are at the top of their game it's probably why this,0.12016476
movie feels so fresh these are perspectives which we rarely see out of Hollywood and,0.021593858
this movie proves and we need more of them book smart is a success not,0.0468429
just because of the of its creators but it should be mentioned because if film-like,0.012637159
book-smart is rarely made it's about a strong female friendship I think that that is,0.051605612
what this movie is about it it's more I think it's a movie that will,0.033825252
make you laugh she's got a really cute smile not as sharp as your chin,0.18930595
it's a movie that'll make you cry it's it's not only a comedy and it's,0.0936971
not only a film just made for women I think that seeing two female leads,0.14716522
on the poster I think that people have this like misconception of oh this is,0.047097664
a movie only for women but literally it's a movie for everybody I've never seen,0.150553
one of these characters at the center of the film let alone two of them,0.019698748
and the fact that they're I mean they couldn't be less competitive with each other,0.037756488
they're actually like aggressively obsessed Sophie's not there no no no not excited come on,0.044949785
okay allow me this beautiful he's really really special this is a raunchy comedy about,0.12607625
two teenage girls one of which who happens to be a lesbian and the film,0.027194703
never turns her or them in escape goats for cheap sex gags or one-liners it's,0.23971708
just a funny ass movie I put out a message and asked my female friends,0.60783243
to give their thoughts on this movie as they would be way more accurate in,0.049304076
describing how important it is to them and our current climate and here are some,0.009395054
of their thoughts overall book smart is worth it a hilarious film with plenty of,0.11288233
portability which you should definitely add to your library a huge success for first-time director,0.023064578
Olivia Wilde a great vehicle to show the many talents of Kaitlyn Dever beanie Feldstein,0.086716
in the rest of the cast one of if not the way to look at,0.023915347
how to write and create teenagers believably and finally one of the best comedy films,0.042813215
of the decade book smart is well worth the price of a ticket a DVD,0.07262941
and your time see it now as its box office hasn't really indicated what a,0.020334
