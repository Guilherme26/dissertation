very great job of balancing screen time for all the characters of course some are,0.013098131
going to get more than others but I think that everyone was very memorable even,0.026581403
after walking out of the film so I haven't talked about who my favorites were,0.023445062
first and foremost Daniel Craig who is this Detective this famous detective who has higher,0.07651075
deceptive Blanc he is absolutely hilarious he is this over-the-top investigator who have like this,0.085923105
strong southern accent and it's almost feels as though that he's making fun of his,0.023708476
character at the same time but it's not too over the top where it starts,0.02195239
to become like borderline on parody I think everything is balanced and done just right,0.03102616
and he was so hilarious to watch I can watch a whole series just based,0.02652553
off of his character them coming up with different murder mysteries I'm totally here for,0.15181886
their franchise since we want to turn everything else to a French shock that we,0.04131256
didn't ask for this is what I'm actually asking for and I think that everyone,0.029921291
will be on board with me as well also to Toni Collette who plays um,0.04886306
she's married into the family she's the daughter in law she is so fun to,0.0549588

totally be fine with that her accent her demeanor of this character she is so,0.0530311
fun to watch I just loved her so much but I have to say I,0.05880024
was pleasantly surprised by Chris Evans not that I didn't know that he was going,0.030238584
to do a good job but he plays ransom who is really this just just,0.014316748
evil and greedy freeloading son of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Josh's characters I was,0.25520882
just like Chris like I like the sight of you now like we've never seen,0.073973075
Chris Evans play a bad guy before but I have to say I was really,0.07932115
entertained by his character the language that he had in the film is so nice,0.019041548
to see him kind of brushing off rendering these different characters that kind of get,0.042096145
out of his like nice guy persona I can't wait to see how much more,0.09309378
we see from kids Chris Evans within that couple of titles that he's working on,0.02678362
but I will have to say our lead of the entire film Ana de Armas,0.10755687
who plays Marta who was the caregiver for mr. army before his untimely death I,0.12781571
