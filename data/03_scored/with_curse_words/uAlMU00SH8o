Martis filmmaking career is now in its sixth decade and in all that time he's,0.07326862
directed 25 narrative features in 16 feature documentaries and of those 41 movies maybe six,0.05368421
or seven could be called crime dramas and yet for better for worse many people,0.30172628
who have only a passing knowledge of Scorsese's movies likely associate him with crime dramas,0.14771603
and gangster fare so if you're one of those people who dismissed the Irishman out,0.3711033
of hand as just another Scorsese gangster movie stop it it's not so much that,0.40310332
Scorsese only makes gangster movies or even mostly makes gangster movies it's more that the,0.35004348
ones that he has made have pretty much defined the genre I mean you know,0.15294653
any list of the best gangster movies ever made is gonna be like half scorsese,0.3301543
for that reason chastising haters aside I guess it's only appropriate that his opus about,0.16372642
looking back on your life and everything you've ever done would take the shape of,0.31089434
an expansive gangster crime epic the 77 year old directors latest begins in a nursing,0.32567912
home with octogenarian Frank Sheeran played by Robert DeNiro directly addressing the camera in this,0.047052324
confessional style he recalls a fateful road trip he took a quarter century earlier from,0.073352106
Philadelphia to Detroit with aged my boss and longtime friend Russell Bufalino played by Joe,0.08843781
Pesci early in this road trip flashback the movie flashes back a second time -,0.086091936
Frank's time as a truck driver for a meatpacking company in his 30s when he,0.16035134
first meets Russell and becomes a Lackey for the Bufalino crime family the story moves,0.17059782
forward from there chronicling Frank's rise from Bufalino Lackey to Bufalino hitmen while it occasionally,0.23151225
returns to old Frank on the road trip and really old Frank addressing the camera,0.077151194
in the nursing home eventually the main storyline catches up to this fateful road trip,0.05504421
and it becomes clear why Frank's life story confessional begins with and occasionally returns to,0.049433738
this road trip as it ends up being the most consequential trip of his life,0.098283105
after Frank proves himself capable of painting houses which is a blood splatter related euphemism,0.32715243
for performing hits Russell introduces him to union leader Jimmy Hoffa played by Al Pacino,0.1038844
and Frank transitions from being a crony for the in the shadows crime boss to,0.14954783
being a company for the high-profile union leader and this is how old Frank's narration,0.07457305
introduces Jimmy Hoffa nowadays young people they don't know Jimmy Hoffa was they don't have,0.08398623
a clue I mean maybe they they know that he disappeared or something but that's,0.12606773
about it but back then there was a nobody in this country who didn't know,0.123219244
who Jimmy Hoffa was and astute and helpful observation as this young person only knew,0.10204676
that Hoffa disappeared and that's about it turns out as Frank's narration continues in the,0.06311734
fifties he was as big as Elvis in the sixties he was like the Beatles,0.13532756
next to the president he was like the most powerful man in the country bar,0.06436875
none I had no idea before this movie but Hoffa captured the respect and admiration,0.05533144
of millions of Americans including and especially Frank's daughter Peggy played by Lucy Galina as,0.09033613
a child and Anna Paquin as an adult in these early years young Peggy's admiration,0.09482748
for Hoffa is in direct contrast with her disdain for Russell and her indifference towards,0.16731703
Frank she sees her father's violent ways first hand and she deduces the nature of,0.18770802
his work for Russell where are you going go to work in the later years,0.06739507
Peggy's indifference towards her father turns to disdain as she suspects that he was involved,0.34971464
in Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance much has been written about Anna Paquin's lack of lines but,0.096108936
her silence is the whole point she's silently judging Frank and she's the audience stand-in,0.12686202
by doing so the whole point of old Frank in the nursing home telling his,0.06792013
story directly to camera is that he's trying to explain himself attempting to justify the,0.09387898
choices that he made that ultimately made his daughter hate him I know what wasn't,0.2643898
done good dad I know that I know that I was just trying to protect,0.03478775
all this from what this framing device makes the movie a confessional it's not a,0.0703206
spoiler to say that it ends with Frank talking to a priest and given the,0.07192516
final shot of the movie it stands to reason that whoever Frank is addressing as,0.15709372
he looks directly the camera is also intended to be a priest or perhaps God,0.06503108
himself or herself this comes out in the language of his narration how he's embarrassed,0.31481206
by parts of his own story when he talks about when he left his first,0.09497085
wife for his second wife he's like ashamed of himself eventually Frank comes to a,0.3838764
crossroads where he must decide between Russell Bufalino and Jimmy Hoffa and maybe it's not,0.08879184
even much of a choice one of the interesting through lines of the movie is,0.049723927
it's meditation on power young Peggy rebukes Russell and is taken by Jimmy because Russell's,0.05653221
clearly a criminal and Jimmy at least appears to be clean Jimmy doesn't get his,0.4514173
hands dirty so Peggy admires him because she assumes he isn't dirty but his hands,0.66201955
aren't dirty only because he makes Frank do his bidding Frank is powerful in the,0.26585945
sense that he can perform hits and beat the out of people but the real,0.39929822
power is not with Frank but with whoever's holding the reins in Jimmy Hoffa has,0.04577784
the power to control not only Frank but also billions of dollars of Union money,0.06323622
one of several fascinating historical subplots involves how hafez Union money investments built Las Vegas,0.06894954
what it is today in doing so Hoffa commands the respect of Frank's daughter that,0.0889387
eludes Frank his whole life there's plenty of clear overlap with Goodfellas you know both,0.08902695
are about one man's decades-long involvement in organized crime and like Henry Hill and Goodfellas,0.14730282
Frank Sheeran is a passive character in an early scene Frank tells Russel about his,0.06749199
time in Italy in World War two you got all this you followed up if,0.36075824
they tell you to bring some prisoners into the woods you know and they don't,0.11167075
they don't tell you what to do but they just say yo hurry up Russell,0.09552507
Bufalino works the same way he tells you to do something and you take care,0.3306306
of it however you take care of it and when you did something for us,0.06914734
you did it yourself like Russ used to say when I asked somebody to take,0.17580068
care of something for me I expect them to take care of it themselves I,0.12349557
don't need to rule to come back after Frank's time as a soldier in Italy,0.14956446
he's then a soldier for the Bufalino family and then he's a soldier for Jimmy,0.09589088
Hoffa but he never has any power of his own or any control over the,0.088916175
events around him he's a cog in a machine powerless to prevent the death of,0.25021264
his friend another clear overlap with Goodfellas is obviously the presence of Robert De Niro,0.097541906
and Joe Pesci and De Niro's giving the best performance he's given in like a,0.10318166
decade understated but still conflicted and by the end pained and as impossible as it,0.08535334
may seem this is actually the first collaboration between Al Pacino and Scorsese and you,0.08911048
know Pacino has kind of been in ostentatious shouty mode for the last thirty years,0.08239121
she got off great ass but shaadi mode works well and he's playing an ostentatious,0.90170974
overconfident Union boss but the real revelation of the movie is Joe Pesci emerging out,0.11754634
of semi-retirement to deliver one final devastating performance for the director that made his career,0.08065556
in the 80s and 90s do not expect the fiery short-fused firecracker that he played,0.16461796
in Goodfellas and Casino or even in my cousin Vinnie and home alone here Pesci,0.14888798
never even raises his voice and yet he still as menacing and terrifying as comedy,0.31089434
Vito and Goodfellas in one key scene Frank Sheeran finds himself explaining questionable actions to,0.049323563
mob boss Angelo Bufalino and a brief appearance from Harvey Keitel and Pesci's Russell Bufalino,0.1487233
doesn't even have to say a word in the entire scene and yet he's as,0.15367228
captivating and tension inducing with silent looks as he is in the why am i,0.15266992
funny seen the digital d aging of the characters was like the big hook talking,0.09922341
point of this movie and you know it ballooned the budget north of 150 million,0.0807586
hence why Netflix got involved and I thought it worked fine for the most part,0.055763748
like the first cut from 55 year old Frank's face to 35 year old Frank's,0.1863098
face is like a little jarring but I got used to it on the Directors,0.24100298
Guild of America director's cut podcast Scorsese said that he sees the digital D aging,0.11489504
is just the next evolution of film makeup you know you have to factor in,0.06568029
how it effects lighting and camera angles but you have to do that with makeup,0.15150923
too admittedly the digital D aging is for now limited to faces and there's always,0.08111763
so much that can be done to make a 75 year old body look like,0.12540588
a 35 year old it's what it is so why age down older actors why,0.16994128
not cast younger actors the younger scenes and then use traditional makeup to age them,0.15047911
up for the older scenes which is what would have been done in the first,0.050557867
hundred years of moviemaking and the answer simple that would change the movie down to,0.06241489
its bones the Irishman is about an old man looking back at his life whether,0.242058
that old man is Frank Sheeran or Robert De Niro or Martin Scorsese take your,0.29760668
pick a younger man playing Frank Sheeran would lose this pathos more important than the,0.18803416
overlap with Goodfellas are the differences where Goodfellas is a frenetic hyper stylized roller coaster,0.14601396
Scorsese said at the time that he wanted the movie to feel like an amusement,0.10986659
park ride the Irishman is a patient slow-burn with a 200 minute runtime to prove,0.22385809
it the framing device of that opening road trip from Philadelphia to Detroit is a,0.070453934
decent metaphor for the movies leisurely sprawl Frank and Russel could fly but they opt,0.05217
to drive and take their time and take care of some business along the way,0.092827976
and reminisce about when they were younger men and they are certainly no longer younger,0.17719898
men where Goodfellas followed Henry Hill from adolescence to middle-age the Irishman follows its characters,0.11490174
from middle age to the grave when secondary and tertiary characters are introduced there's a,0.08157696
freeze frame in text that displays their name and the date and manner of their,0.087592065
death underlining that this movie is above all about endings as I mentioned Scorsese is,0.35822093
now 77 years old De Niro's seventy-six Pesci's 76 Pacino is 79 yeah these guys,0.12878343
might continue to make movies for another 10 years you know Clint Eastwood's 89 after,0.10581282
all but it's hard to not consider this movie something of a swan song especially,0.09857935
given the nature of the story chronicling the lives of these men from their thirties,0.29141903
to their 80s it all has the air of we've been at this all our,0.059815697
lives and we've had a good run but now it's over earlier this year director,0.087673195
Todd Phillips used the term Trojan horsing to describe his attempt to hide a psychological,0.1552854
character trauma inside a superhero movie an argument to be made that Scorsese and screenwriter,0.14227818
Steve Zaillian used a gangster movie Trojan horse to deliver a movie about getting old,0.40313607
and out living everyone you ever knew and having nothing about time on your hands,0.40960538
to look back on your life as you sit around and wait for death far,0.69542736
too many cultural critics over the years have made the mistake of acquainting the actions,0.08784826
and morals of Scorsese's characters with Scorsese himself and yet it's hard not to notice,0.10410025
that the main character of the Irishman is taking stock of his life's work in,0.1186818
a movie that plays like the greatest hits album of the director that made it,0.08648855
from the genre to the soundtrack to the locations to the players involved I don't,0.04576479
even know how to judge the Irishman against the rest of Scorsese's filmography like you,0.2235155
know it just feels like it's so in conversation with his career it's hard to,0.10421666
place it among the other works in his career but you know regardless of whether,0.084203474
or not this will live on as one of his best movies you know too,0.09350214
soon to tell it certainly feels like both a piece of a hole and also,0.56560856
