hey guys we just got back from an early showing of spider-man into the spider,0.15958956
verse and I gotta say whoa it's really really good yes I thoroughly enjoyed it,0.12504128
was funny it was had a great story you guys must go out and watch,0.13514772
this film yeah it's great I really liked it I think it's one of the,0.09984569
best if not the best animated film of 2018 III was really uh you know,0.08118253
encouraged by the trailers and and mostly what's that one movie where the best part,0.045164246
of the movie was the this trailer break up that showed spider-man at the end,0.1512511
and early showing or something like that and boy I could tell you man I,0.10325456
am just blown away about how good this is this is pretty much as close,0.15144125
as you can get to simulating a comic book on screen yeah I really like,0.10087434
the animation uh I know you before you saw the trailer you like I don't,0.11055443
know about this whole kind of animation how did you feel about that one yeah,0.09086598
so that was something that I was knowing yeah I was really worried about it,0.03830026
I freaking hated and I said I hate it hate it hate it and no,0.5614101
matter what I'm gonna hate it but as I was watching it you kind of,0.44870877
get used to it now do I do I and so and overall it wasn't,0.10029546
an issue you get used to it and you're into it and things work out,0.11492032
and by the end you don't really notice it but would it have been better,0.10472553
if it was flowing animation maybe but it's just that that.oh sees you in my,0.10958892
brain from from computers and low frame rates and you just see the like the,0.15492915
big said somebody can fix this but i swear to god you get used to,0.13673247
it and you won't notice it anymore the story really engages you and it involves,0.080220744
you and honestly I'm not gonna say this lightly there are moments in this movie,0.13296092
that are literally a work of art I mean this is a creatively driven movie,0.08259503
thing you know what I'm saying it's just comic-book movies have kind of started to,0.10395642
get a little say me I mean we've had 18 of them with Marvel films,0.15222946
and we've had bad ones with DC and some good ones and and they kind,0.24143659
of adhere to a formula this one kind of throws the formula out the door,0.09631858
I mean this one seems to be able to take risks and and they pay,0.08625372
off in my opinion what do you guys think about about that yeah I think,0.11181861
that well it's a different it's a different medium entirely right could they get to,0.04232138
do more things because it's animated so we had longer more drawn-out fights that just,0.11335527
would cost you know hundreds of millions of dollars if it was real with CGI,0.06379769
and so we get to see some really like really exciting scenes like action sequences,0.0830115
in this this film we wouldn't normally yeah and for me it's one of the,0.075483195
better spider-man films that I've seen I just have not seen homecoming so what do,0.117851764
you guys other spider-man's that have seen started falling this one it's bringing the Spider,0.14583567
Man bringing back to Spider Man yeah it's surprisingly deep complex even maybe overly complex,0.1475643
for children now we went to a screening and they brought in a lot of,0.066824555
kids as well this is it's like 9:00 in the morning right now I'm barely,0.1518546
away guys but but you know I luckily they were quiet you know but but,0.17062995
I thought it was surprisingly deep complexed and it had a sort of a you,0.2401621
know mature jokes from tongue I wouldn't say mature jokes but adult jokes it probably,0.09246395
would fly over the heads of kids here and there of course they've got the,0.10897241
funny stuff as always but I was really happy with how it's not you know,0.114111386
sort of dumbed down or appealing just to the stupidity or the dumb parts just,0.90239984
fart jokes fart yeah you know when you're watching a bad animated film it starts,0.56103426
to do that crap this does this tells yeah this tells a complex story an,0.76987433
interesting story and there are a lot of characters in here okay we're not gonna,0.052133366
spoil it for you we're gonna talk about it and in spoilers but you've seen,0.13739069
the characters in the trailer so we have you know we got Peter Parker we,0.023134548
got Gwen Stacy noir spider-man which is Nicolas Cage I was also to see you,0.19440624
have like an anime spider-man and then you have a porker Peter porker yeah I,0.44514963
don't know his name but so what did you guys think of this whole spider-man,0.15242723
team-up thing though there was a lot of spider-man like there were pretty much well,0.14922148
developed like they all had the little quick things but it was great that is,0.068271205
funny though my favorite turned out to be Peter porker after I got like nlgger,0.31980088
for it I was like this is too cartoony I did a vlog news oh,0.10593748
yeah so I felt he was kind of disappearing in there and I was like,0.08113714
what is the point of view to porker I was more into noir spider-man but,0.15440263
I know the moment you talk about where they make a fun of the fact,0.06001612
that he's a cartooning goes off so that that is a standout moment of the,0.18009414
film yeah they do have other cameos in fact well we'll talk about it in,0.08806625
spoilers but cameos that you might guess and cameos that you maybe may not guess,0.10058063
and little Easter eggs I should say for for that if you're a fan of,0.29277
the game there are Easter eggs so yeah just overall really well done the writing,0.16489923
in particular I thought was very good when they made a joke I was laughing,0.1298452
now I say this film route starts real strong to me like you know it,0.060913283
kind of throws a lot at you but it's easy to understand you're involved you're,0.15223043
engaged I think towards the end of the second act and the third act they're,0.09251981
still throwing jokes in there but I'm not I didn't laugh I wasn't laughing at,0.094150364
those jokes but I was still fully entertained you know what I mean so I,0.087018535
didn't matter at all to me that you know everybody was hilariously laughing in the,0.1197252
audience and I was like oh really good because the action was so awesome I,0.0416851
just I liked how they can go exaggerated because there are exaggerated moments in the,0.06208762
film the the villains you have a nice new spin on Goblin on the villains,0.17438996
in the universe because this is an alternate dimension Miles Morales so what did you,0.08380426
guys think of the title character Miles Morales he's our first african-american slash Latino spider-man,0.35073805
and hero yes he's Puerto Rican I'm about to beat you up if you say,0.6317083
that but he's actually not the first Latino spider-man that somebody else and you probably,0.2586325
don't know but I do know what do you think about this one I liked,0.10363582
it I thought I was gonna be like kind of annoyed like little he's gonna,0.31089434
be like teenage drinks kind of thing but it was all great and he act,0.076489896
like an adult and took matters into his own hand when he needed to they,0.18105032
I was worried that they were going to because he's new right he's a newer,0.14245656
like as far as like his him having the powers he's a newer spider-man and,0.31089434
I was worried that they're gonna be like oh he can't do it and him,0.09411025
you know dwelling on the fact that he wants to prove himself over and over,0.14876801
and sometimes movies with with teenage main characters they really stress it to the point,0.043132484
where it's annoying I get it you want to prove yourself like get it you,0.31266165
want to prove yourself they didn't do that they had just the right amount of,0.09938265
time and they developed him as a character and they didn't fall into some of,0.07803213
the pitfalls that a lot of these teen led movies fall into yeah you really,0.27921194
believe that the his teenage lifestyle where his family loves him you can tell his,0.07781339
father loves him his mother loves him you could see that we get a little,0.15126391
bit of the the sort of Peter Parker school stuff we get a little bit,0.15056528
of that with Miles Morales just with a spin on it in school and worrying,0.07867111
about what people think of him and things like that of course you know it's,0.0798559
miles and so it's slightly different it's all it's all really really fun because you,0.10455868
get to see a spider-man origin story with a different take on it and and,0.15386803
it's it hits some familiar beats but yet it's all unique and we see that,0.05467111
over and over because when we see and and I don't say that as a,0.0502551
negative thing because you think you'd get sick of it because they say we got,0.31333563
to start at the beginning cuz every time somebody's introduced they're like we got to,0.050136533
start at the beginning and that's funny yeah yeah but it goes real quick and,0.039645478
you're interested in in their little backstories I'm gonna see where they come from and,0.35395047
I think the story from Miles Morales has done there are so many references to,0.021463409
his comics they do him justice this like I said not only visually is a,0.15526989
great adaption of a comic book style just flowing and it works perfectly there but,0.0723196
also some of the storylines and themes and and origin stories of Miles Morales so,0.029379455
I think they nailed they absolutely nailed it is great voice acting across the board,0.17724219
what was the day Joe you know this the guy from new girl the Peter,0.10767314
Parker Johnson Jack Johnson yeah yeah yeah but at first I didn't I was like,0.059199423
that's not Peter Parker but I got used to his voice oh don't like okay,0.19235961
so I I was skeptical about that but he convinced me later on he did,0.10528126
his job really well though I heard behind the scenes that they were going to,0.047452092
have Tobey Maguire at one point voice one of these spider-man and you'll see which,0.19109063
one and now I think they're kicking themselves like they got read in any of,0.44165865
you or like it probably could have probably worried yeah but I think it win,0.08089382
the discussion with movie theaters they thought that maybe it would be too confusing for,0.06310652
audiences because it's like what universe is this spider-man from but it's not confusing because,0.12005813
if you look at the start it's clearly telling you what universe is from it's,0.06387584
showing references and scenes from Tobey Maguire spider-man so what are you little jabs Tobey,0.19355758
put out a commentary track where you do this voice just for free do it,0.1392857
and then when I get my DVD cuz I'm gonna buy this DVD I'll put,0.2122545
that on there so that the so that we get a little bit of Tobey,0.09755382
up in the movie because this was great man I'm totally buying this as you,0.16369201
can see what about some of these subplots as you feel that anything was out,0.19245046
of place in the movie or did you feel that all the sub blocks sort,0.10890431
of strengthened it well I didn't so what what's great about the subplots in this,0.113222696
film is they didn't feel like subplots because they were all actually involved and they,0.08009662
were important they didn't feel like we were going off on little missions to go,0.06754286
take care of this for no reason or go do something over here to take,0.1057001
care of that they were all actually important to the development of all the different,0.10208156
characters so they didn't really feel like subplots so I think they did a really,0.06851314
good job yeah we get everything the purpose didn't bother me at all mhm we,0.09745318
get villains that we've seen in Miles Morales this universe and and I honestly I,0.15267162
thought that because maybe they were it was a kid's film or something that they,0.12302757
were gonna change some of the story beats of Miles Morales for example the fate,0.08796458
of spider-man in in Miles Morales is universe but they didn't pull any punches you,0.26595473
know and and that gave the move the film emotional impact were you guys emotionally,0.18806903
did you feel any emotion and did you did okay well that's mark of a,0.11842742
good film and it's not just that moment from from his sort of origin story,0.06841737
there are other moments that are earned by the film man this is good not,0.08262201
only is it in my opinion the best animated film if I'm correct of 2009,0.08747835
18 but it's it's one of the best films of 2018 in my opinion so,0.054959804
if you're a huge fan of spider-man you're really gonna do you you're gonna freak,0.719448
out this is him shown in a completely different way it's it's so nice and,0.075744726
refreshing to see all these different spider characters I didn't realize I knew that there,0.06718483
were alternate universes and I knew they've been doing other stuff with like Wednesday there's,0.04314301
Marge oh yeah I know there's a future man there's there's other spider-man and you,0.31089434
know so I just think you know and this is a complete story - they,0.052650698
don't try to sequel bait and if they never make another one of these into,0.07761052
the spider-verse movies this thing stands alone because of how good this is only if,0.080143444
they get the same writers because that dialogue is so strong that the jokes are,0.066905096
so smart and the references are like the right references a sequel bit a little,0.16666378
bit I don't know the very like we won't get into spoilers but they definitely,0.085889965
see well that is not in the film that is an after credits no no,0.058241587
there's absolutely something in the film itself for their sequel baiting okay no it's no,0.11444573
that's not what a sequel bait is it's complete freaking story doesn't shove it in,0.40067044
your face at you like oh man and now I need to see the next,0.4848951
one actually get the real story it's nothing like that it's really really satisfying this,0.08163461
one just the animations great the voice acting is great the writings great the creative,0.0707652
direction is great what else do you need okay so let's go with final verdicts,0.09719568
let's start with Joe I really enjoyed this one the plot was great like you,0.24002215
said the animation I'd like to come work style I want to see more of,0.15052114
these I really hope this apart to 910 yeah I think this is this is,0.09104789
it's got a couple things that I wouldn't call like flaws in the film the,0.06983287
things I would like to see a little bit more of and because I didn't,0.08135
get to see some of those things that are only I mean this is almost,0.08424017
a 10 out of 10 film from this oh it's really really close yeah well,0.0812918
yeah I mean where did y'all where did you miss the points well without putting,0.15766478
too much into it there was they kind of resolved the main story kind of,0.043799013
quickly I mean things just kind of fell into place and I mean it's already,0.11093731
two hour long film I have wanted ten more minutes at that especially during the,0.05511764
climax of the film just to kind of feel like we resolved everything it just,0.06461725
kind of felt like we got to the we got to where we needed to,0.060860798
get to things kind of resolved and then I mean it took a little while,0.07031217
with it but it didn't feel like it had the big the big ending that,0.08335396
I really really wanted yeah so I think that's why I get set 9 but,0.076118335
it's really high 9 for me yeah yeah it starts so strong it's really tight,0.15328309
and focused on miles and then when other spider characters start to come in it,0.064018294
gets it gets busy and it's not a negative busy but you still have to,0.1054521
mention that it gets busy there and you're like well actually guys you did such,0.100934595
a good job on miles I kind of want to see more of miles build,0.09191205
up separately from the other characters and and that but they do integrate it so,0.02377246
well his origin story with the other characters that you can't really be mad at,0.24022804
it the the villains were good I think you know some of the you know,0.2416202
you've seen some of them in the trailer but maybe you could ramp that up,0.07817755
just a tiny bit but yeah they were villains though they were good they were,0.19145487
relatable they're not like evil for evils sake which I always have such a hard,0.15148444
time buying like they they were they were really good villains and that's something that's,0.115805775
hard to do and a lot of these comic book films don't do a very,0.15378812
good job with them animated film actually I'm keepin remind me of the guy from,0.17948136
I thought it was cool I was like this is a different looking kingpin and,0.09239302
I liked his design it's ridiculous but that man has some power and you know,0.5876557
what it was invoking a daredevil Netflix's daredevil and what kingpin cares about most in,0.2797364
that film is kind of here in this film and referencing this man that's in,0.15440902
the comics as well so just well-done across the board I am trying to find,0.064497516
reasons to to give it a 9 but honestly I'm trying to find reasons not,0.07320207
to give it a 10 you know what I mean and why should I be,0.09077944
doing that I think that it's a 9 out of 10 but what I'm actually,0.090181604
gonna do is I'm gonna go ten out of ten on I don't fault you,0.31089434
for it either and the reason why I'm going at ten out of ten is,0.11440533
because I think it is such a wild success for creative minds for different directions,0.1174776
for different animation styles for just style this film oozes style and honestly at first,0.117778465
I was not I was skeptical of it and I was like I don't want,0.076224044
this you got a bunch of rap music you got the shitty framerate animation I,0.9453342
wanted to come in like a crabby Joe but it convinced me and I like,0.22399703
the soundtrack there yeah I know I'm saying I like the dang soundtrack by the,0.09076177
end of the film and it gives this Spider Man his own unique feel to,0.0401185
it and man it's just a fantastic film and I'm so happy that you know,0.07917816
a character like Miles Morales who when he first released you have of course you,0.094103746
had bigots and idiots you know saying you know talking about how forever and always,0.90174407
forever and always but also you have weinerman Fez look I don't want to news,0.31089434
I don't want to spider-man and they kind of nlgger him because he's not spider-man,0.5223477
he's not the spider-man or whatever and over time the they embraced him because they,0.1336266
would read them in the stories are you really good no he's yes and so,0.058982998
for them to also get his movie correct I think is a great thing for,0.13924293
all of Spider fandom and for everybody out there that you know loves superhero movies,0.07266472
and in an inspirational story of trying to be the best that you can be,0.07543667
so this film has a good message and it's just great all around so I,0.06253284
highly recommend you go out and see this in theaters when it comes out what,0.07730791
a what a badass success from Sony you know I I just didn't expect that,0.23039246
from them you know they it's been a while yeah I mean after what they,0.082678966
did with with venom which venom is fun but it's not like my venom super,0.19272527
face is so super faithful to the venom character other than some of his wackiness,0.47136837
and and it's live action so they have that restriction this and I gotta say,0.092217475
this okay I always say this DC animation is number one it's superb they're always,0.10855023
kicking nlgger ass not ninja Bevan but here comes shut up with the ninja but,0.93538237
here comes nlgger Marvel with like our freaking bazooka and they just nailed this if,0.7688707
Marvel's animation is now gonna be at this level I know this is Sony when,0.121696934
you know in collaboration with Marvel but way more of these please way more cuz,0.14776382
just great alright guys so if you want to stick around for spoilers which I,0.18024935
don't know why you would want to do that because this reviews coming out early,0.073299155
but if you want to we'll talk about some of the plot points and you,0.07747209
can end the video now and then wait till this comes out and then come,0.1551125
back to the video and watch the spoilers that'd be cool too so thank you,0.07600003
so much for watching and we shall see you on the next angry Joe show,0.16632177
yes hey guys welcome to the spoiler section where we can talk about all the,0.04156203
nitty gritty here so jumpers jump right into this this equal bait that you think,0.3714026
what are you talking about because they will talk about the end credits scene that's,0.07310708
after all the credits but what do you mean so he lies down at the,0.11166677
very not that in the movie not before the credits so like before the credits,0.05882439
start to roll he's like lying down he puts a sticker on a big metal,0.42490065
eagle yes and then he lies down in bed and puts on his headphones and,0.46140417
then she starts spider-gwen starts talking to him no I I didn't what what does,0.12861332
she say but hi hi it's Gwen do you have a time like it was,0.15157093
like two seconds long did I nlgger miss now fully sign in my life might,0.46076673
take it or something what it's like okay well then that's not a sequel bait,0.12193631
if it's literally 2 seconds long it's like a they still communicate okay they don't,0.12452567
misunderstand the definition of what I see well what do you think it's equal bait,0.10161124
is a sequel bait is when it's like literally all you don't you don't get,0.13618866
to fight the final villain and he disappears and Hank you fight is Noah's lieutenant,0.23095495
and then and then and then at the end of the film he comes through,0.066678934
the portal and it's lucky now we're gonna fight but yes that's an over a,0.0937061
huge sequel bait but they're definitely baiting that there's gonna be more of these films,0.18474412
coming I hope if they can talk if they can talk transdimensional II then then,0.15209013
I think that's I don't think that that's weird because I don't think that matches,0.15129833
up with the film and if it does then that's a weird sequel bait because,0.09044684
she doesn't have that technology well yeah we source there was nothing Ben should not,0.14500307
have that technology neither does miles and the the only person smart enough capable of,0.12714863
that is two people even the anime spider-man which she goes back to her own,0.19479002
universe so I unless you built one for everybody and then threw them through the,0.1743436
portals but though we got to talk about the end credits scene which is quite,0.047190078
possibly the funniest you have so I don't know see it sucks because I don't,0.7331077
know in the main review did I mention there's an after credits you did here,0.08657201
okay cool so now we're gonna spoil it and basically it's what is memes yes,0.09815733
it's spider-man 2099 Miguel is you know he has the technology and apparently another no,0.10555784
it's not a goober it's a device it's a gizmo this time which is gonna,0.15294826
allow him to travel between the vs. safely or whatever and so he travels into,0.041846875
the next he's like I'm gonna go to the beginning and they go into the,0.07597059
1960s cartoon late sixties cartoon and they do this meme that we've always seen on,0.06963901
reddit in other places the spider-man pointing it's like why are you born again and,0.23558672
he's like come with me III need your elvers like it made the whole theater,0.4645533
erupted and laughter and I do hope that we do get to see spider-man 2099,0.0962217
and she had even Spiderman the 90s I wanted same animation that whenever he comes,0.09988453
back yeah okay some of the Easter eggs there the Sony ps4 spider-man suit is,0.15713893
seen in the background in one of the glass cases multiple ones well there are,0.033839043
also comic book suits and so there are in glass cases on to me in,0.14492261
the in this particular universe is revealed like she's almost like Alfred she's got this,0.094990976
shed that turns into a spider cave with all this advanced technology and she helps,0.15407577
Miles Morales make his suit or help him find his his suit and his skills,0.24218524
so that was really cool and but what we do want to talk about so,0.051892437
the emotional impact we were saying on what made you emotionally impacted their job he,0.16235995
just had a motional connection with his uncle like they don't you got along and,0.13772225
his dad didn't get along with his uncle right he was still it's like his,0.15119953
uncle was going down the wrong path maybe yeah they really explain it much but,0.081450365
it's revealed that you know his uncle is the Prowler house and that's it the,0.100471266
way that it is in the comics and the and the problem I thought that,0.06839998
the honker knew who he was cuz come on he's a Spider Man you can,0.21863446
see in there but I guess not he just thought if some punk kid he's,0.3547645
gonna kill some kid and then when it's revealed that it's his nephew he's like,0.83074576
oh no you know not only does he hesitates he makes a decision to not,0.085651636
do it he gets shot in the nlgger back and miles picks up his body,0.6364068
and he and gets him out of there because you know this is a big,0.15829542
epic fight with scorpion doc ock who's a female Liz or something live and and,0.40445077
tombstone I think it is I'm not sure I I'm not sure that that doubles,0.1507484
go though yeah the the guile clone looking guy yeah and and they have this,0.09449386
big fight in all maze cuz miles got a little sloppy and led them there,0.31089434
but anyway so he manages to get prowler you know separated from the main group,0.09178546
and you know his father rolls up on them as as his uncle dies and,0.4763445
it's a touching scene and then and then you have the whole thing with you,0.24004768
know the the brother going up to his brother and seeing his brother die and,0.69542736
he saw that separation they did he doesn't want the same to happen with Miles,0.07608075
so he tries to go into contact miles yeah and the other one that I,0.05013112
was talking about is at the beginning of the film towards the beginning of the,0.044430844
film where miles is thrown right into the middle of a battle he sees his,0.10814842
versus universe's Peter Parker who's this perfect Peter Parker he's like the best spider-man of,0.1811107
all time and he loses to you know not only this Collider technology but also,0.10321369
the kingpin they they nlgger literally murder his ass and and right and it's touching,0.94992846
right before because he's all messed up but he's like you think you can get,0.1821639
out of it but he's like I need you to promise me that you're gonna,0.18154953
shut down this machine and you're like me and and you take this device and,0.45729536
and and then they kill him and so that gets an emotional reaction because not,0.6359308
only do you see it with his own supporting characters but you see the whole,0.060580913
city mourn spider-man's death and that's what you don't flow handled and it was in,0.23957404
the comics so I'm not mad you know throwing out a spider-man death like I,0.4171787
was mad about Superman's death if they didn't earn it that's that's a part of,0.23969887
Miles Morales growth that he owes it to his Peter Parker to you know sort,0.0644935
of continue this legacy so it's really handled very very well um Doc Ock has,0.07836658
revealed you knows you think it's just as weird and happy maybe scientist lady or,0.3052482
whatever he and then she turns into Doc Ock and you're like oh nlgger kickin,0.6268455
nlgger ass keepin kingpins story was handled really well that he's not doing anything evil,0.8838325
he's actually just trying to pull his is why his dead wife and son from,0.5154597
an alternate dimension and just kind of steal them so he can have them again,0.40326148
because they died in this universe yeah so he's not just trying to be a,0.15242893
jerk or just trying to make money I mean spider-man wants to stop him because,0.8268225
he'd been a worm to open a black hole and kill everybody but I think,0.8097838
I think oh well to any even even the fact that he is a nlgger,0.7241075
jerk because like even his family notices you're beating the nlgger out of spider-man and,0.89910764
now you're beating nlgger out of this other spider-man we don't want anything to do,0.53490317
stop trying to pull us into this universe we get away from us and it's,0.15110917
it's that so he takes out his anger and aggression and emotions out on our,0.24047562
spider-man and you know they highlight Miles Morales his powers for those of you don't,0.21687393
know he's not just a standard spider-man he has unique spider-man powers that no other,0.10601153
spider-man has had he could turn invisible he also has a little bit of telekinesis,0.3051537
what's not call that it's something Kinesis type of powers that he can use oh,0.08468539
they called it a venom strike or something like that I don't think it's called,0.14337362
venom strike in the actual comics but now I'm not sure cuz I don't read,0.1601275
a lot of Miles Morales his stuff though I definitely want to now he's black,0.5876557
and red man now is the time like right now is the time to start,0.10739501
buying all of the original brown stuff because once everybody sees this movie they're gonna,0.14854717
buy all yeah it's really cool and I'm I'm happy and it's sort of like,0.05084432
we're you know Nightwing you know becomes his own character and everybody likes him she's,0.19966602
a badass but now we've got you know another spider-man that it's fun to see,0.43131858
him and he's been in a lot of recent media for spider-man so it's cool,0.1496205
to see him get his own movie like you know the spider-man video game he's,0.24942608
in that and I'm pretty sure he's going to be featured in the next spider-man,0.14972515
video game they teased a little bit of that I hope to see venom in,0.17010224
that one by the way so and I hope does he maybe venom in the,0.2161214
next into the spider-verse film - no not Tom Hardy's version though they could if,0.08484656
they wanted to because now they hit they could play with so much the fact,0.09465023
that they have all these different versions and now that this one did so well,0.098139055
maybe they could do some flashbacks and get Toby to voice the original Peter Parker,0.06499816
because that's who so actually the this Peter Parker is overweight he's depressed he's into,0.33959752
it we go from perfect to everything that could happen everything goes wrong worst loss,0.14172271
Mary Jane kind of yeah but that first perfect Peter Parker that was who they,0.047543287
were going to get but I think they just reused his voice the other Peter,0.1716398
B Parker but yeah so um what else what else for I like the fact,0.079392664
that is as father as a cop in this universe now you have sort of,0.11482711
like a Commissioner Gordon thing that they could be doing together I'm looking forward to,0.07970089
working with you I love you and he takes off and because he doesn't know,0.12356164
they thinks it's some other kid I don't think they did the reveal a change,0.09729584
though because I get first thing his dad hated spider-man yeah not only did he,0.28870782
hate spider-man for the vigilante thing because you're a cop and you you little jealous,0.8039924
of the fact it's spider-man is doing he's getting all the credit but also because,0.10904288
at one point he thinks the spider-man is the one that killed his brother you,0.53490317
know miles analysis uncle because he's lying over him as he's given his dying words,0.48610342
then takes off so yeah just well well done the the side characters didn't really,0.04711816
have like they try to really milk the fact that the robot lady anime lady,0.238698
lost her robot and it didn't really go anywhere it was just like this small,0.16087998
little thing just to try to get more remote I was like okay now you're,0.12228052
being just now you're just being manipulated you know like the sad puppies fans you,0.4397056
don't need to go that far but no she was super sad about that thing,0.10049123
and then you know ten minutes later she was billeted buts her if her father,0.5423846
died and that was that was his robot no it's well that's true and she,0.25579658
does build a new robot but she's still got the spider with her that she,0.15356398
has a telepathic link to yeah that's the only spider that they didn't nlgger kill,0.31089434
us I wonder what she would think about about all the other Spider Man this,0.10537875
yeah they killed it miles is just like it and he has it doesn't even,0.6051316
hurt him you expect this like great reactions but it does power transfers and stuff,0.2516393
they never explain where that spider comes from because this is technically miles Browns universe,0.09333653
where there already was a beauty parlor who already got bit so how the spider,0.13711764
had the the name of the the lab then they break into it has they,0.055451475
printed the lab was pretty close by cuz he was funny Green Goblin yeah correct,0.110969804
but you know I think I thought in his story it was like made by,0.062422384
Norman Osborn Osborne's stuff that he made a bunch of those different spiders and and,0.14707856
they got loose but I could be wrong about that but yeah I'm sure you'll,0.21313204
hear about in the comments yeah but just fantastic you don't have to know all,0.08816648
the comic book lore to really enjoy this and you will come out knowing a,0.0887027
lot of the you know best and character beats from each one of these spider-man,0.18113093
from their universes what about your Nick pics though new pics well I already kind,0.18021369
of mentioned them in the review what about yours I I wanted more out of,0.14836597
like the final fight because the they kind of get to kind of get there,0.085699975
and then they just like plug the thing in and there's it takes him a,0.073964976
while to get there but punching and kicking between kingpin I thought it was good,0.7993608
because it's like they're always wanting to help him help him help him help him,0.089337096
and then at the end as I could take a leap of faith in me,0.19225383
that I can handle this on my own and he goes out there any kicks,0.32743323
is that yeah it just didn't feel like a big final fight it felt like,0.08550327
there's a lot of stuff happening because the the beams were going off and there's,0.061620682
like city's being melded together and things like that but it didn't feel like the,0.05706887
like an end boss it just it was just really a fistfight between Miles Morales,0.19343391
and kingpin at the very end that's what pin does and so I was did,0.0966418
you want the fist fight to be more an extended well they were like scorpion,0.40254992
was there doc Hocker was there they had they had all of these bad guys,0.4723634
there but they kind of resolve them and they just like they immediately knockouts court,0.15008453
like scorpion gets knocked out with a hammer right and then Doc Ock I don't,0.3209319
remember what they what happened that she's kind of you know what happened to her,0.0924649
no good and they just get brushed aside and they do a bunch of stuff,0.16789044
when a lot of things are happening but it's just like I wanna seem like,0.052827936
Doc Ock was gonna have a subplot like she was gonna maybe betray kingpin yet,0.189963
again with her own mansion agents at Sur machine it's not just machine and that,0.061227486
she was gonna do something like that but no that never you know never goes,0.19142202
anywhere I really wish some of the second and third act jokes I was laughing,0.081951596
at as I was looking at everybody else they're all laughing and having a good,0.12907249
time it could have just been because it was like 9:00 in the morning that,0.068828195
I was on laughing at every single joke you know like the anvil falling on,0.18913823
the machine at the end people hahaha because this thing well the anvil was something,0.25010747
there of the anvil I laughed when the anvil hits what's-his-face scorpion yeah cuz that's,0.2634873
in a moment when you you got one over by Peter porker what happened he's,0.18856932
just fun again that's what he does shyamalan he's amazing what happened he dropped an,0.11343457
anvil basically just like a cartoon yeah so basically just Joe won't explain it to,0.14858387
you they're in a fight and and he's like who are you what could you,0.37310156
possibly do to me you're just a cartoon and cartoons are lame and stuff and,0.7071768
he's like me got a problem with cartoons cartoons like they were pretty violent and,0.31131464
Damned Kong who shed any dead nlgger amazing spider-man moves and then he busted out,0.8460273
the nlgger mallet hammer and from his pocket and he said later on he gives,0.2621696
it to miles he's like this will fit in your pocket and I believed him,0.3060715
and then he drops a big nlgger ambulance 4 p.m. scorpion actually took that anvil,0.40398195
pretty pretty well it was the hammer that knocked him out yeah so that was,0.31909317
pretty funny and yeah just the use of colour the use of comic book panels,0.1334889
the use of spray pain and creativity and artistry just I got to give it,0.1950563
up to the director the writers and the you know everybody involved in that movie,0.051708166
alright guys I think that's pretty much any other standing her haircut is because he,0.16717747
got his fingers stuck on her on her hair and he's trying to hit on,0.420967
her and it didn't go so well the whole put your hand on the shoulder,0.15286043
