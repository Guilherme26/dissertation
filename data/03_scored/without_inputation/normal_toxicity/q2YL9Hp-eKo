hey everyone welcome to scene by dawn today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the,0.07910491
shape of water with Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer I have the pleasure of watching,0.08863841
this movie at the Dubai International Film Festival as one of the 13 films that,0.067861006
I watched there so I'm slowly going through the lists as they're being released in,0.05384452
the UAE this one in particular has taken some time being released in the UAE,0.056545895
because of censorship issues I'm not quite sure if this is one that you actually,0.15185277
want to go to the cinema here to watch I am interested to go and,0.05494458
see it here to see how it has been edited because I heard because there,0.07292242
is nudity that there's been some sort of cover-up made for Sally Hawkins character and,0.18298943
I'm sure that certain activities that she was involved in will also have been concocted,0.08762527
sure ah the story is that ELISA Esposito is a mute janitor she can't speak,0.30396998
because of this accident that she had when she was a child and she works,0.32466653
at a research facility the scientists at this research facility have discovered this reptilian frog,0.40655497
like sort of creature and they're holding him in one of the labs and they,0.15990424
want to use him as a part of space exploration and send him up into,0.14258143
space and it's somehow some sort of race between them and the Russians in the,0.26209006
process of cleaning the facilities she starts to interact with this creature and they develop,0.2540065
a really cute relationship especially around hard-boiled eggs and this lady really has a thing,0.49657422
with hard-boiled eggs and really maximizes her time that is used during the making of,0.17288679
hard-boiled eggs I thought that Sally Hawkins did a really great job in this film,0.16845486
however for myself I did find it really difficult seeing her naked and seeing her,0.74473006
go through part of her borning routine especially during the cooking of her hard-boiled eggs,0.40330017
if you know what I'm saying if you've seen the film you know what she's,0.08712246
doing anyway so I couldn't find it difficult because Sally Hawkins plays mrs. Brown in,0.07925566
the Paddington movies and I kept wanting to like yell at the screen dang like,0.088800535
how long does it take to hard boil an egg I think it's only like,0.40266934
15 minutes but wow she uses that time personally let's just say she's like feeding,0.29038438
him these eggs and they have this relationship because he doesn't speak either he's this,0.24049976
reptile creature and and she can't speak if their relationship develops in this non verbal,0.34520546
way but it was really cute and simple and deep and very sweet and there's,0.06253732
just this acceptance he's not accepted for who he is and he's definitely being mistreated,0.09664543
she also is not accepted by a lot of people or society at large and,0.17345178
fields rather marginalized because she can't speak so they have this deep relationship I really,0.26432672
really liked the beginning half of this film I just thought it was beautifully made,0.070581704
I loved the development of their relationship I loved the development of all of her,0.21737443
other relationships and just the development of ELISA Esposito's character itself however the last half,0.059028603
of this film completely lost me like once she got him out of the facility,0.22012205
and then they started developing this more intimate relationship between the two of them I,0.15286782
don't know it just got weird and I felt like the deeper themes that could,0.07044906
have actually been really drawn out a lot more clearly and with a lot more,0.09171193
care I felt were a bit rushed like the ending and understanding how her injury,0.18735872
plays into the carrying on of their relationship I just felt like it didn't end,0.08097255
in a way that really brought a lot of substance to that theme it was,0.056182377
there but I felt it was a bit rushed and it was a bit I,0.15434545
just felt like it got a bit weird and I felt like the story got,0.14931512
lost in that I just didn't have the same feeling in the last half of,0.0642358
the film that I had in the first half of the film that can understand,0.052760843
why this film got the best picture at the Oscars because it's very artistic and,0.076299086
if you look at it that way it is a very beautiful film but I,0.059585202
just feel like the last part just really as a as a cinema goer and,0.05746176
a fan of film and a lover of stories and I just felt like the,0.050966445
last half of the film just kind of lost it for me again this film,0.10781558
B+ because I did like the artistry I loved the music I loved the color,0.10395359
palette I really did like the development of her character but then it sort of,0.09699679
fell flat at the end so it lost marks there it is entertaining but entertaining,0.06391232
in an artistic sort of way give this video a big thumbs up if you,0.15446872
like hard-boiled eggs don't forget to subscribe and ring that little bells you don't miss,0.21293995
