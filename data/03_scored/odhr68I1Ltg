what a lovely movie what a lovely movie it was pretty good so I just,0.11336185
saw Mad Max fury road and whoa holy hell I'm still processing everything this film,0.36622652
had so much time surrounding it even when Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 98% then,0.17768277
I'm glad I'm reviewing this film the following day because at first I wasn't sure,0.07559226
how to feel about it I watched the first two Mad Max films I never,0.15548502
got around to the third one but watching this modern-day take on it was so,0.09520801
kinetic so fast paced it was so different that I wasn't entirely sure how to,0.07349247
respond but after thinking about it yeah this film it's pretty nlgger sweet what everyone's,0.18895546
saying about this film is that it's an amazing action film some are saying that,0.0788889
it's one of the best of years some are saying it's one of the best,0.05752321
of all time some are even saying it is the best of all time some,0.054073464
are even saying God doesn't exist but this movie exists essentially this film was I,0.11729049
got 90 minutes a two-hour car chase but it's done like Mad Max style meaning,0.14003685
you get the awesome production design to get the incredibly assembled vehicles you get insane,0.4033343
Road thrashing so serious like brutal deaths sometimes watching death in a movie is so,0.35521954
cool it's never cool in real life but sometimes you know like watching people get,0.1479656
killed you're sick you're you're all sick but the movie was greedy it was haunting,0.8355208
it was violent yeah it's like not grotesque that's actually something I greatly admire about,0.19290599
this film it like feels more disturbing and violent than it actually is showing you,0.31089434
there's really not much core in this film when there is gore it's like so,0.08705003
fast-paced that you don't even remember what it looked like I loved it because this,0.15952425
whole plot this whole story takes place in the middle of this adventure like the,0.08503018
trailers don't give away the plot for you so I don't want to ruin it,0.22673647
for you either like a short synopsis for me Charley's Theron is on the road,0.28377658
to somewhere where people are trying to stop her and she gets the help of,0.12946968
Mad Max and hence the chase ensues it's interesting because this movie is mainly but,0.12569539
it does take time for character in like little moments you learned about the characters,0.08472764
like throughout the adventure through how they're responding to this adventure without having like expositional,0.067940615
dialogue you see when I first walked out of this film I was like that,0.08153472
dude did it have much character but that's I thought about it more I realized,0.07032439
that it just didn't have like expositional dialogue George Miller not Frank Miller you say,0.073509395
Frank Miller a lot of people are gonna kill you trust me but George Miller,0.6811124
has this like wonderful ability to like come up with a story and it's like,0.08132658
post-apocalyptic world driven by the power of fuel and water resources rather than making his,0.05129549
films like a big exploration of this world he always focuses on the plot and,0.07519752
he only allows his characters to say what they would say in that moment of,0.08974939
time so it actually wouldn't make sense for these like strangers coming together during this,0.09352809
really high intense chase sequence to start giving a bunch of expositional dialogue but if,0.066997774
you pay attention to story and the characters all they're like this film has a,0.08100323
pretty strong theme about redemption they're about three main characters in this and it's really,0.036162477
targeted towards redemption and it's interesting because you actually understand more of the characters and,0.106347255
how they respond to the violence how they go about the violent moments and in,0.17945875
between George Miller really allows his actors to provide that depth without having to tell,0.10412559
the audience exactly everything about someone's past or what they're currently thinking Tom Hardy as,0.05906702
Mad Max Mel Gibson played the original max and that was a legendary character and,0.11840976
I'm so glad that Tom Hardy wasn't trying to be Mel Gibson's max Tom Hardy's,0.117673084
backs actually seems like you might be older he seems very haunted by the wasteland,0.31089434
on to by his mistakes from the past he's like actually going a little insane,0.49104807
at times she sort of reminds me from that weird creepy boy from the road,0.32269615
warrior because Tom Hardy's Max is sort of like an aggressive boy like he doesn't,0.3954382
speak much she doesn't there's a lot of grunting a lot of that like you,0.17716794
could tell he's a really violent threat but you can still so see that he,0.2413163
has a heart but similar to how I sort of perceived a road warrior Max,0.037754584
is sort of used more as a character device to support the bigger picture of,0.037337616
other characters like Charlize Theron character the trailers didn't reveal who she really was so,0.07412103
I'm not going to she's fantastic in this film she's someone who's also haunted by,0.15644954
the demons of her past and some present-day mistakes too she's a warrior a protector,0.33221632
just like that Charlize Theron would be to me in real life if my girlfriend,0.2721266
shaved her head like Charlize Theron we would have serious relationship issues that would not,0.24131149
be okay with that she only has one hand the other is mechanical if I,0.13958105
have a mechanical hand you know what I use that for I don't know where,0.105851255
these jokes are coming from but she kicked some serious ass in this film this,0.9156528
film actually has a lot of badass females you got young badass females middle-aged badass,0.6162013
females and even elderly badass females it's like the fine brothers show except with kicking,0.7171903
ass instead of reacting with Charlize Theron I really bought her as his character you,0.8229019
know to see Charlize Theron on-screen I were usually like it's Charlize Theron she's really,0.14801939
beautiful and yeah she's a great actress but I'm still aware as you saw at,0.10451239
least there and I really liked how she went all out with this she was,0.15091915
not the most attractive in this film but her ability to like transform into this,0.18038957
badass one-handed lady was nlgger dope but the true scene stealer for me was Nicholas,0.76252264
Hoult like I keep saying I'm not gonna give much away they don't say whose,0.07478863
characters in the trailer but Nicholas Hoult performance man that's the one you're gonna walk,0.086677924
away thinking about like a plum introduction he seems like oh okay he's just another,0.3004334
crazy Mad Max villain with each scene he gets they give him more and more,0.5979898
to do and you explored him actually more than you would even explore max of,0.0864537
this film the film was great too for doubt the character's name don't know the,0.06808268
actor's name but I like the villains motives in this film it was different from,0.09613276
the other villains that's that's actually what I like about this whole franchise the first,0.11393571
Mad Max the gangsters are like serial killers on wheels the road warrior had villains,0.5154597
that were like tribal territorial savages in a way this one is more like a,0.4032572
cult it's like a civilization ruled by evil religious thinking so I like how the,0.5876557
characters are always like nlgger crazy but they always have a different type of thing,0.6699994
about them the music of this film is wonderful it really does get your heart,0.10650147
going I love the editing of this film I love like the man craziness the,0.31089434
kinetic energy that just the camera angles and the editing bring to the film I'll,0.04525974
be honest I strongly do prefer the first half over the last half that's not,0.096556425
to say the last half is bad it's just the last half had like one,0.15132451
or two small moments that seemed to drag a little bit and the actions started,0.060260527
seeming a little repetitive but then again there's just so much nlgger action that I,0.17571206
don't even know actually if it was repetitive it might have been different it's just,0.0975584
so much in your face that you know it's like what was that different than,0.31089434
what I saw so yeah if you don't walk away thinking about the characters necessarily,0.09424731
you will not forget the action in this film it's so cool because it's from,0.15224816
the same writer director of the original Mad Max but he like really updated it,0.13395597
like he's been paying attention to films over the last 30 years and I feel,0.12811784
like in a lot of ways this has some of the best moments of the,0.063769944
entire franchise because those action scenes are like cleverly choreographed at what school is that,0.0931629
yes there's some CGI here and there but it's mainly practical effects and like crazy,0.31349096
stuntmen and at the end of the day it has just enough character to provide,0.09443573
the emotional depth to support the action scenes let me get straight to the point,0.099947326
here all in all I gotta say Mad Max fury road got it manically right,0.27511403
