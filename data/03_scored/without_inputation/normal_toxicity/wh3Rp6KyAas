well guys it's spooky season and you know what that means horror reviews in particular,0.15092856
i wanted to talk about four silent horror films this year that i thought would,0.14505777
be really fascinating to talk about so anyway let's waste no more time and talk,0.1755428
about the cabinet of dr caligari the cabinet of dr caligari was directed by robert,0.07595265
vine and tells the story of francis who in turn tells us the story of,0.070545994
how he got involved with a strange hypnotist named dr caligari who uses a sleepwalking,0.24157843
man to commit heinous crimes this film was released in 1920 so this year it,0.24209672
is celebrating its 100 year anniversary so i absolutely had to talk about this film,0.07691855
but also this film has a very important place in horror history as it is,0.12499494
often seen as the first in a long line of feature-length horror films and i,0.10717829
think that is really fascinating and it's really interesting going back to this film and,0.0771592
seeing how much it has influenced the genre many years later this film was part,0.06899808
of the german expressionist movement that was going on at the time in germany and,0.084498554
i'm not going to spend too much time on that because it has a really,0.08078359
fascinating history i'm not going to go into the history or pretty much any of,0.09041083
the themes or thematic material that a lot of people go into because you can,0.070842266
perfectly find that anywhere on the internet i just wanted to talk about this movie,0.09883898
and how much i really enjoyed this this is actually my third time watching this,0.05921326
film but this is the moment that i really was like man i actually really,0.09556006
like this film a lot i love its visual splendor which is basically the reason,0.089102946
to watch the movie the visuals are fantastic in this film the angles nothing in,0.1334959
this film is at a right angle everything is at strange weird angles the lighting,0.14900786
is so strange because it's so unnatural because if you look at the shadows throughout,0.10531099
the film you might notice that they're actually painted onto the sets that really makes,0.03749924
these visual shots just so interesting and planned out and they're really beautiful to look,0.25738576
at this is a really good looking film and if you're looking for something with,0.06377891
a lot of style i don't think you have to look much farther than the,0.15115272
cabinet of dr caligari it's got just so much splendor and artistry in it and,0.08606907
it's very powerful to look at many directors have been influenced by this you see,0.073652394
this in the later horror films like dracula or frankenstein but also you see it,0.1087
in later filmmakers such as tim burton who also does the weird thing of not,0.12222109
having everything at a right angle and even the character of cesar who is the,0.06085585
sleepwalker character that dr caligari has going around murdering people is very similar in look,0.47471768
to edward scissorhands and i think that's not a coincidence at all it was very,0.14917494
much a influential film for tim burton as it has been for a lot of,0.06775094
people and also i was surprised by how creepy i absolutely found this film the,0.27950317
character of dr caligari in fact the actor that plays him is extremely sinister in,0.31089434
this film there's just something about he has these very circular glasses that have this,0.11385739
dark black rim around them that make his eyes just pop out and it's really,0.23125088
creepy there is a continuous feeling of dread throughout this entire movie that really never,0.14976466
lets up and the visuals on top of that really make you feel like you're,0.07997995
in a dream world it just doesn't feel real which actually does go into parts,0.1529976
of the plot of the movie that go on later on which i'll say for,0.10493382
my spoilers section but yes the visuals are fantastic and i actually really enjoy this,0.082092226
story and how it is framed as this man is you know telling this other,0.10062155
man the story of dr caligari and i think that's really cool also the score,0.072540045
that was used for this film i'm not particularly sure if it was a score,0.06850155
that was written for the film or if this was a score that was added,0.06596365
much later with a restoration but it really sets the tone of this movie very,0.10382304
well i really enjoyed it a lot it's a lot of fun now of course,0.088466704
a lot of the things that this movie does seems a lot primitive now with,0.07319311
the way they you know draw basically odd the sets to make the shadows work,0.07458403
or you know the flimsy looking sets but that adds to the charm and really,0.06743256
this disorienting feeling that you feel throughout the entire film which leads into our spoiler,0.15052626
section so if you don't want to know anything about this 100 year old film,0.116671905
step away and return to this time code so that you don't get spoiled but,0.16957009
basically this movie is more or less a fever dream of our main character who,0.14014207
is actually insane at the end of the movie we figured this out that he's,0.31089434
been at an insane asylum this whole time and that dr caligari is actually the,0.2738993
director of this asylum and might not be a terrible person at all we see,0.5876557
that many of the people that our main character encounters throughout the film are actually,0.051876977
patience at this mental institution which i think is it's a really really good twist,0.2719921
but also it brings up the question of what was real and what was not,0.04280241
and i think it is really apparent just due to the visual nature of the,0.05573886
film and how everything looks kind of off kilter and awkward and wrong it is,0.2127012
probably true that our main character is completely crazy and has lost his mind and,0.4643173
we're basically seeing a movie through the eyes of a madman and i think that,0.53198195
is extremely cool it's a great twist for this film however i will say that,0.077484205
i think that the twist can be a little confusing now this might not be,0.043026164
confusing for everybody but i will say i did watch this with my mom and,0.10368055
she was a little confused as to the ending of the film i think you,0.15468939
know maybe things could have been cleared up a little bit more it could have,0.13566469
also been the translation of the film that we were watching but nonetheless i think,0.035703544
the twist of this film is fantastic i think it's really intriguing and makes you,0.14291018
think of the film in a completely different way i also really like the way,0.03456963
the title cards are written in this film with this really unique interesting style of,0.060868297
you know showing us the text of the film i think it's really interesting i've,0.06205879
never seen another silent film really have text on the screen quite like this that's,0.0721933
so disorienting to watch and that is really this film completely summed up it is,0.11993307
disorienting it is dreamlike and it is absolutely a wonder to watch it is a,0.10292973
beautiful looking film and definitely just the influence of this film is shown throughout all,0.058359463
