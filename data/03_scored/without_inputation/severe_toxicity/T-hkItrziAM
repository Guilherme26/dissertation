and the setup because this is a spoiler free review and I will be putting,0.06419355
out a spoiler full review on Sunday with that said the last Jedi was good,0.075417854
but it left me with so many mixed feelings now before I dive into my,0.10986639
full thoughts be sure to put your thoughts down below in the comment section tell,0.056146823

section on this particular video also stick around to the end of this video to,0.08340205
learn how you might be able to appear in one of my future videos using,0.042467985
the start of staff with that said let's start talking about the best things about,0.0262089
this movie the best thing about this film is it's a character based film where,0.030364968
each of the characters have a journey thereon of discovery and there's a great performance,0.014869515
backing that journey that they are on this might be the best we've ever seen,0.046544895
Mark Hamill in this role and maybe ever in his entire acting career Carrie Fisher,0.039867118
gives another amazing performance it just has such sadness in the character as she's seeing,0.030195346
the world around her as she's fighting for hope once again Daisy Ridley is charming,0.092016846
as she's ever been has met all these characters seem to be pretty charming and,0.040880855
likable in these roles Brian Johnson brings possibly the most unique and distinct directorial style,0.021286542
that we've seen in any Star Wars movie thus far with angles he uses the,0.020897409
look of it and this is a gorgeous looking movie the action is shot with,0.045821175
wide angles you can see what's happening in the lightsaber battles there's little distinct things,0.032073826
and our space battles and our land battles that just give them a unique look,0.029496238
and that's all Ryan Johnson's action and this is a movie that avoids the tendency,0.018135566
of most sequels to just go bigger better bigger equals better it doesn't do that,0.017991222
and while the stakes are more dire than ever and you feel the danger of,0.050389655
everything happening it's not because they're just making everything bigger whereas in previous Star Wars,0.02645901
movies planets what star systems are destroyed there are death stars and star killer bases,0.07682339
this movie doesn't escalate stakes by just going bigger and makes it more personal and,0.018899864
it's directed in such a way that you actually fear that something bad could happen,0.037451833
throughout the whole movie you just feel like the resistance could fall apart at any,0.036449403
time our good guys could turn to the dark side at any point in time,0.07562473
it in that regard it's very much like Empire Strikes Back in that the story's,0.019857062
not gigantic but it's personal and it matters in that regard it's very much like,0.03593322
Empire Strikes Back because the scope is smaller it's more personal but for some reason,0.022623561
the stakes seems so much greater than they did before from there let's move on,0.019155959
to the parts that I had mixed feelings about this film constantly goes against your,0.100042954
expectations and then at the movies very unpredictable but it feels like it's unpredictable for,0.029078502
the purpose of being unpredictable for the sake of being unpredictable in that regard sometimes,0.027586496
it feels hollow like moments will happen where you think there's gonna be substance to,0.041985728
it something really unpredictable happens and you don't feel the emotional weight that you should,0.03846624
feel there the audience had a reaction like oh that was shocking but you didn't,0.013831829
feel substance to it it just felt like they were actively trying to go against,0.037725225
whatever you thought was gonna happen or what could have happened just to make sure,0.021446852
that the movie was unpredictable and in that I appreciated that it didn't play into,0.013452674
what we expected or what we wanted then who took twists and turns but at,0.013082832
the same time they didn't pay off the way I felt like they should have,0.033211954
the film also plays a good bit of homage to the Empire Strikes Back and,0.005785102
Return of the Jedi now what it doesn't do is use those films as a,0.045352887
template like the force awakens did but there was a lot of stuff that felt,0.065298416
a little bit too familiar some of them was good perhaps and some of it,0.059122186
felt a little bit too much like okay we have to have an element like,0.07614889
this from one of these two movies and you could just feel where scenes were,0.033040337
going because it was playing so much homage to previous films also the humor in,0.015640464
this movie was a little bit mixed certainly I laughed out loud it added a,0.0853537
levity to a movie that had a lot of weight to it and a lot,0.22681014
of Arcanist to it but the jokes didn't land as well as they did in,0.031815734
the force awakens a lot more of them felt forced some of them felt like,0.050951738
they were callbacks to the previous movie it was like I don't think we need,0.025627531
to do this I'm cringing a little bit at how much you're trying to be,0.056758124
JJ Abrams type funny speaking of JJ Abrams some of the mystery box type stuff,0.069344066
that was set up in the previous film this movie doesn't embarrass itself by trying,0.058568753
to give answers that don't work but it feels like it kind of shifts away,0.027662992
and avoids answering some of those questions and so is the level pretty mixed bag,0.054142624
on a lot of different things with this move it wasn't like I hate this,0.06344189
it's not that loo that's really bad it was just kind of like okay that,0.052337315
doesn't fully work as well as I think it should have and with that said,0.023174997
from there let's move on to the worst aspects of this film and by far,0.049053304
the worst thing about this movie is a plotline involving Finn that just feels unnecessary,0.061
now in one sense it is necessary because it kind of links together a few,0.032220166
plot points in it but you feel throughout the whole thing like ooh you could,0.024164792
have found a much smoother way to do this without having this gigantic rabbit trail,0.08797586
that's the least interesting thing about this movie like every time that we go off,0.04373915
to cutaway to this other adventure you're thinking man I wish I was back with,0.054306258
Luke and Rey man I wish it was with kylo Ren right now and it's,0.08859049
not interesting even the the design of the world where things kind of take place,0.0635716
and the characters there is some of the most bland stuff in any Star Wars,0.04264492
movie ever you're just like wow this feels so la and possibly because of this,0.0489502
subplot this movie is way too long for the type of story that's being told,0.022635534
I mean the movie has a fairly straightforward narrative in the movies the longest Star,0.016808525
Wars movie that's ever been put out and that's because you've got a few too,0.07210857
many subplots going on and some of them are way too long and unnecessary for,0.05455171
the type of movie that's being told here and you feel that weight as the,0.03602169
movie goes along and since so much stuff is going on it feels like the,0.02682087
movie takes a long time to get started and while the stakes of the movie,0.027142819
give a sense of urgency to it the environments and shots are used make the,0.03975071
movie feel like it's not moving forward like there's several points in time where there's,0.021408936
establishing shots that feel like haven't we seen this exact establishing shot four or five,0.11497766
times already as it cuts back and forth between the three kind of plot lines,0.026399143
that are going on also the script frequently uses miscommunication or bad communication as a,0.02258498
way to kind of move the story forward and create conflict but the end result,0.031260304
is feeling a little bit like if people had just communicated information that they could,0.06737512
have communicated you could have avoided big gigantic dire consequences and that's not really addressed,0.02272467
within the movie and so it kind of popped out to me like shouldn't that,0.05188233
have been addressed or should we come up with a better reason that they didn't,0.023913352
have certain information so overall this is a movie that I did enjoy I do,0.03666359
think it's a good movie but it is a movie that leaves you with all,0.0576967
kinds of feelings that are all over the place that kind of demands additional viewings,0.01624445
and for that reason I'm not gonna put my rating in the movie just yet,0.082893856
I'll put a rating on my spoiler review that I'm gonna put out on Sunday,0.19380325
I have a pretty good idea where it's landing amongst all of the Star Wars,0.03033437
movies but it's giving a score to it so that you guys will hold me,0.055748377
to in the future I want to hold off just a little bit until I,0.21865252
have a second viewing and if I'm being honest you need to go see this,0.0172981
movie it is a Star Wars movie it is a good Star Wars movie it's,0.035323247
not one of the best Star Wars movies but it's a solid addition to the,0.030498005
franchise then we'll definitely elicit a response from you and in my case I need,0.04925685
to see it a second time before I can fully decide how I want to,0.019315602
score this one so those are my initial thoughts on the movie here's what some,0.027316432
of you guys are saying about it this was fantastic I mean everything the tension,0.08526191
the suspense the humor if I'm being completely honest after one viewing I'm slightly underwhelmed,0.020096527
and don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but for me it just felt like,0.03607956
a series of really great moments that never quite came together to form a cohesive,0.038348503
story in a word last Jedi is unpredictable um I loved it definitely go out,0.03192216
