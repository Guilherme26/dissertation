to talk spoilers about Mission Impossible fallout is to talk about Henry freakin cavil alright,0.43361965
last chance this is the spoiler review you've been warned and they do a really,0.10856408
good job teasing it out okay are you still here he's the villain oh and,0.27055827
he's such a good villain he is like I've debated about whether or not I,0.28521657
wanted to go here but I will he's like Alan Rickman good as a villain,0.24303359
uh and I think he like this isn't a role as good as Hans Gruber,0.16909245
but I think if someone gave Henry Cavill such a role he could nail it,0.07330209
he he is just so good why is he so good because from what I've,0.0758531
heard Henry Cavill it's not a nice guy so question for McQuarrie finally put him,0.15169692
in his element and he shines I mean think about it right what was the,0.07419091
best moment in Justice League evil Superman because that to Henry Cavill is and again,0.27960452
the great thing about Mission Impossible followed is how they they let the Henry Cavill,0.09710654
villain storyline unfold so in the trailers they let it be known to us that,0.15128927
he was an enemy of Ethan Hunt but they made it seem like it was,0.11787127
just the CIA versus the IMF you know like you know enter interagency political espionage,0.12817127
drama right but then in the actual film like halfway through the movie they clearly,0.094722115
telegraphed that Henry Cavill is indeed the villain in his exchange with Angela Bassett the,0.15294959
whole audience was kind of like you're are you telling us this like wow and,0.079686105
I think that it's a credit to Christopher McQuarrie that he didn't have to follow,0.0533336
the rule of three Hitchcock's rule of three is that you have to tell an,0.08389894
audience something three times for them to get it you know it can be verbally,0.1509672
visually but you have to put it in front of them three times but here,0.08593378
in one conversation and I guess it's also a crate to Henry Cavill he does,0.085929535
speak very clearly with his American accent right but he was like Oh Angela Bassett,0.094371304
you suspected it was an American agent working as a double agent I think it's,0.17856859
hunt and then he hands her the phone that we've only seen once before in,0.12824199
the bathroom and he gets her off of lark at the lark decoy and that,0.18508592
phone was in the bathroom and then when he hands it to Angela Bassett it's,0.09430489
a pristine phone and you're like oh my god it's him he's the villain but,0.19739224
it's so subtle I wonder if everyone gets it but I was amazed at how,0.07450395
crystal-clear it was to me and it turned out to be crystal clear to Angela,0.07302221
Bassett too because of course they were able to do an ambush on him with,0.18284266
that great underground you know gotcha scene we'll talk about that but that was really,0.099890135
cool and then basically for the rest of the movie Henry Cavill plays mission impossible,0.08415452
gasps stalk he should have been Gaston I don't know if he can sing but,0.3517452
Luke Evans played at being evil or a character that just had a very bad,0.16662894
temper and would go out of control the evil calmness of Henry Cavill it's just,0.24181889
a wonder to behold I mean and I think you might be a little bit,0.2799205
like that in real life no no I think I'm reek aval is just very,0.24175537
artistically naive although those do sometimes lead to someone being evil those characteristics my favorite,0.28369203
moment of his in the movie I liked almost all of his moments in the,0.09264031
movie but the real standout to me like if I were putting together a clip,0.18641323
reel of Awesomeness like for movies in general I would include where he nlgger his,0.28313944
head looking down at crews holding onto the bottom of the elevator and like through,0.11174526
the gate it's like one of those wire elevators so they can totally see each,0.1033634
other and just Henry Cavill so perfectly Telegraph's like you're so stupid Ethan Hunt I,0.91811717
just can't believe you're continuing with this year so I so it would be so,0.10587134
easy for me to kill you of course he has a reason not to but,0.8359203
it was a really fabulous moment I loved it so much and I know a,0.041971732
lot of you want this to lead to a Man of Steel too but unless,0.083061
it's injustice the injustice storyline with an evil super man turned bad which would be,0.24109887
amazing and Henry Cavill would do such a good job with it but I I,0.08707454
don't honestly I just don't see that happening especially with where Warner Brothers is now,0.06700852
I don't know and also the contract problems I mean maybe I just saw based,0.075857215
on what I'm seeing here and how good Henry Cavill is I don't really think,0.1505847
that he can play a good guy to be honest with you and unfortunately Chris,0.16786227
Evans is Captain America has taken that space so I would love to explore evil,0.32259423
Superman but I don't think Warner Brothers is gonna do that so Henry Cavill every,0.09878028
cab is gonna look out for him Cavill so this is manager Danny Garcia the,0.07864181
rocks ex-wife and business partner and they should be going after roles or he plays,0.08027551
a villain going forward and he I think his star I think his star would,0.23649402
grow because that's clearly what he is meant to do like if if Alan Rickman,0.09157787
was gonna be in a role or maybe you know Patrick Wilson often plays the,0.025139177
villain he's doing so well in Aquaman those type of roles that's what Henry Cavill,0.1992045
should be doing because it would be excellent but he sure as heck ain't gonna,0.31089434
make any more Mission Impossible movies cuz they killed that dude Tom Cruise is like,0.66283983
fine it's fine if you want to have him taller than me throughout the entire,0.14277966
film but there's no way he's gonna make it out of this movie alive like,0.11603029
the whole audience again was in shock because it's like he was such a great,0.09875413
villain do you really just kill him and you left Solomon Lane alive Solomon light,0.794439
is played out I would much prefer to see Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise continue,0.0549891
to go after each other it's like to two different sides of the same coin,0.0962688
I think that would be great but you know the look on Tom Cruise's face,0.19297525
when he killed Henry Cavill he's like these are my movies it was just it,0.55411905
was really funny because of their cuz of the ball and I think maybe that,0.15144114
being taken out of the movie consistently and thinking about the behind the scenes stuff,0.099728934
is why maybe people aren't totally getting into it because I'm disappointed know what this,0.15368752
is it projected to open at and around like mid 50 mid 50s we'll talk,0.032414198
about the story aspect too I have another theory but first I want to rank,0.059032932
the action sequences so by far and away the best one is actually the bathroom,0.08480555
fight I didn't I said Paris car chase was my favorite of Tom Cruise's stunts,0.11221027
but this was like a typical action sequence except it wasn't it was the perfect,0.10847728
action sequence we've seen a lot of bathroom fights in action movies right but this,0.064435065
one just had everything and an action suspense humor they kept levelling up and laying,0.08855707
yang by the way as that lark deep decoy did a great job going toe,0.15024011
to toe with both Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill simultaneously they were like who is,0.05572425
this guy and the audience was like who is this guy and then the look,0.11835415
on leaing Yang's face was like I'm Leung yang damn it was just fantastic it,0.5876557
was edited it was also edited extremely well but my favorite moment was and I,0.04849526
loved Rebecca Ferguson showed up right that was so cool but my favorite moment was,0.029210858
all the blood on the floor and they kept almost slipping on it that just,0.18898949
was a really nice touch I loved it and I like that realistic angle of,0.062138945
spy work it's messy yeah well I also want Henry Cavill is like forget extraction,0.1576793
we're gonna need a we're gonna need cleanup or something that was great I love,0.12663986
that then the Paris car chase which actually the more I thought about it I,0.03348539
realized it was multi-leveled you know like it started out with the acquiring Solomon Lane,0.06210455
then it turned into a truck chase then it was a motorcycle chase and then,0.06933215
it was Tom Cruise in a car and I liked that stuff with the French,0.058412794
policewoman how that played out although Tom Cruise is on I mean of course he's,0.16681206
the hero but you know it's a real life I mean I think he should,0.12573735
get a lot a lot of credit for how I mean I think the way,0.06981223
you played it was very good and he's lucky that that French policewoman wasn't like,0.2292564
you know some particularly women unfortunately will be like but it's still legal what you're,0.55359006
doing sir she was like he saved my life I'm just gonna let this play,0.11290821
out right I mean she should have just walked away I don't know why you,0.18599606
did that doesn't carry a badge I mean I guess someone else though in the,0.053624306
group could have had a badge he was undercover but maybe someone else could have,0.0640084
had a badge I think they could have planned for that eventuality you know you'd,0.15051627
think maybe that might come up but anyway that they're all in a car and,0.15298693
Rebecca Ferguson is chasing them on a motorcycle it was great I loved Rebecca Ferguson,0.15712126
was on the motorcycle and the wind was going through the columns I thought that,0.03938317
was so cool like though like you know just she was going so fast I,0.14096875
thought that was so cool and then when Tom Cruise went down the stairs on,0.11494369
this on with the car down the steps like the way he turned around that,0.17795159
was great I mean the whole thing was not only very well staged I mean,0.1549512
they just kept this chase going I'm especially when he took the knife out he,0.31089434
managed to you were like he's gonna hide in the shrubbery of course we're gonna,0.15784656
find him but there was a way down to the canals underneath that was great,0.15252031
so cool so I like that but then also they showed off Paris beautifully from,0.08569833
the Arc de Triomphe to the small streets where it's hard to drive and sure,0.1526681
enough their truck gets jammed I couldn't tell if that was intentional or not but,0.06947832
I loved it they kept oh it must have been because their motorcycles were waiting,0.08656071
for them but I loved that they kept going they really without even skipping a,0.07308412
beat they're like ok kick out the windshield keep going I loved it that next,0.53490317
the helicopter oh by the way I wanted to say that when the convoy was,0.06758483
going and they had the diversion of that truck / to divert them down the,0.10654522
way the direction they wanted them to go in I couldn't believe it the con,0.09846543
the convoy wasn't like this seems really obvious as a way to divert us there's,0.08787414
no way I'm taking the obvious route I was stopped or I would have backed,0.071640566
up or I don't know why I would not have gone down the route that,0.07119032
I so clearly should go down cuz it's a trap alright so next up the,0.18213852
helicopter chase like the Paris car chase the real thrill here is seeing Cruz in,0.10419906
the middle of all these shots like doing it himself that that's really cool also,0.34688127
on a side note I loved when he was running across that bridge to chase,0.09648002
after cavil like when I guess I'll put the footrace in here - I thought,0.14615668
the footrace was really really well done I also cuz you're like oh yeah you,0.29154527
don't want to run against Tom Cruise he's Tom Cruise running is what he does,0.08547363
so that was so cool and I like the way they were running all the,0.07879408
way through through London in this case and they were they ran into a funeral,0.44630226
and then he was going through buildings and everything and I liked what they had,0.11691713
this gorgeous shot of him running across a bridge it was just like just in,0.40239096
the middle of like the London landscape with them a pedestrian bridge in the background,0.24175529
it was really really well done then the helicopter chase so here it was it,0.058656428
was great to see Oh so Henry Cavill riding in and then flailing around his,0.18391122
own helicopter I also like the gag when Tom Cruise climbed in and there was,0.070566475
another guy dressed like Henry Cavill also caught over the moustache and Tom Cruise is,0.122751705
like his character is like what the hell it's funny that I keep calling him,0.5528814
Tom Cruise instead of Ethan Hunt and I think that's very much you know the,0.07481854
movies the movie made that choice and now they have to live with it but,0.071733475
I thought that was hilarious and also it was not only here also excellently choreographed,0.1093995
and a fight with very high stakes starts out in the air goes through the,0.07311489
ground they're still throwing punches that was great but I like the way they had,0.3023954
it with them son him having to get the trigger off of the the countdown,0.55291843
device Tom Cruise and then his team simultaneously defusing not one but two nukes at,0.075466424
the same time in two different groups so you have ving rhames and michele monic,0.13457698
and having a really nice quiet diffusion scenario with like you know almost like it's,0.15040451
like a surgeon like a like surgery and that was great cuz of course she's,0.21371923
a doctor and they had some really nice I had a really nice exchange with,0.052226815
each other really good heart between those two but then you also have Rebecca Ferguson,0.06314509
and Simon Pegg with the other nuke with Solomon Lane and they have a cool,0.18386622
suspenseful action sequence going there and I love the Rebecca Ferguson had the same simon,0.06743171
pegg although he wasn't a damsel in distress either he's just not as well trained,0.24135031
in fighting as she is and that was they very much seen like team members,0.120555155
and I really really liked that it was just all of it made for a,0.05656808
wonderfully nuanced third act really really well constructed and then last the halo jump I,0.06441296
mean the suits were cool and Christopher McQuarrie at the press screening told us that,0.02490756
they were designed specifically for this so that you could see everyone's face that all,0.18960302
the tech that everyone wears and the in the halo jump scene had to be,0.13496006
designed specifically for this movie for the needs that they had but otherwise I just,0.08281131
thought I was a little boring like it was cool I went through a lightning,0.26731375
storm and the Henry Cavill got hit by lightning that was a fun I was,0.115197405
a neat moment but I think that it could have been more visually interesting in,0.054507554
that regard and I just I thought it was a little boring like when I,0.2413552
was watching and I was like didn't think I told us how hard it was,0.051390175
to film it and they had only three minutes to get the shot each day,0.24220406
because they wanted to film it dusk or whatever and I don't really I think,0.11219076
this scene wasn't worth the effort to be honest with you and also Ethan Hunt,0.22436431
it was frustrating actually to see him trying so hard to save someone who not,0.11410146
only clearly wouldn't save him but you know you kind of were like it's either,0.12467393
felon you know it's not good you know it was just crazy like he was,0.55090374
I mean Ethan Hunt is a really cool stand-up guy now on that note at,0.082185544
the end of the movie Ethan Hunt seemed tired well duh right but what I,0.10296379
mean is is that he nominally was physically tired but he seemed emotionally tired of,0.14947397
this spy game of no-one trusting him having to do everything by himself often being,0.15515117
by himself you know I think not you know he has a lot of teammates,0.27286038
and you know friends you know work friends but I think he's often isolated in,0.053290006
terms of his belief and that will work out right unlike so who has to,0.09672375
do it Ethan Hunt has to do it and I think since they chose to,0.06730324
play it this way with him being so exhausted and they had Henry kill cavil,0.44367364
kill Alec Baldwin maybe it's time for Ethan Hunt to lead the IMF I mean,0.8060606
I don't think Cruz would ever be willing to do it but maybe I'll have,0.17220935
no choice and he could still be in the field and lead and I would,0.09643093
love to see some other characters like Rebecca Ferguson take up some of the action,0.0732214
sequences but I think that after he broke his ankle doing a stunt and the,0.09329196
insurance company it seems had to pony up seventy million dollars in coverage I don't,0.04753706
know if they'll ever let crews do a stunt his own stunts again so this,0.1268956
might be the only direction they can go in and I think it would actually,0.08297056
be beneficial to the series I'm not saying Tom Cruise shouldn't still be the star,0.15144046
of Mission Impossible I think he should be but I think he can I think,0.09505328
he could stand to nice to think he shouldn't killed Henry Cavill off and I,0.53919786
think he could stand to share a little bit more space and I think it,0.18285476
would only improve him and I think he's got a look at the box office,0.086516485
numbers we'll see what they actually end up being but that chill alarm him and,0.058454998
showed him showing him that you know maybe he is doing something a little bit,0.17053373
wrong because this movie deserves better box office numbers quite frankly and as for the,0.083202794
actual story the movie starts out a little bit like like an old-school video game,0.18866135
with the mission presented almost directly to the audience which was both fun and a,0.01097333
bit corny also the wolf blitzer gag was super corny although to the movies credit,0.3491892
I only figured out that's what they were doing just like a few seconds before,0.14912449
it even that I thought Wolf Blitzer was just working with the IMF I was,0.09324225
like woo they flew Wolf Blitzer out there I totally didn't I forgot that they,0.18142635
were using how like Halloween masks and speaking of Halloween masks I loved Henry Cavill,0.07454824
disdain for them he's like you guys are so stupid with your Halloween masks and,0.93232936
they brilliantly brilliantly use that to trick him and when he and I love the,0.080933325
moment when he says it he's like you're stupid Halloween masks he brings it up,0.8785311
again and then as he says it he's like holy crap is that really Solomon,0.7955502
Lane no it's Benjy in a Halloween mask and you damn kids you know scooby-doo,0.8841329
like it was just a great moment and come to think of it I think,0.056215227
the lame wolf blitzer moment earlier does a great job of setting this up right,0.35165313
like it seems lame until suddenly it's very very cool so I know that was,0.5154597
great oh so the opening credits by the way ruined West Bentley being in the,0.13831395
film I was watching the opening credits and I was like West Bentley who's he,0.11680817
gonna be for a while I thought maybe he'd be like one of the members,0.08251609
like one of the Apostles or something but I really liked him showing up as,0.10122767
Michelle Monica's husband you could feel the warmth of their relationship and the lives that,0.1159791
they had and I think that was both of them Michelle Michelle monoghan and West,0.14972594
belly they both did a great job I mean the nice guy Ness was just,0.1333317
rating off of what's Bentley like you wouldn't believe or maybe you wouldn't believe it,0.21147704
but he just seemed like wow I think anybody would be like that awesome like,0.1384046
no matter what he did you'd be like he's so cool and in this case,0.27646995
he took the life that Ethan Hunt turned down and I really could feel that,0.15239067
in that scene I loved that you know the road not traveled and you can,0.08224559
feel how much it hurt Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and maybe you know as you,0.11317144
can see I'm referring to him and Ethan Hunt in this scenario and maybe if,0.07840013
these movies were more story based these Mission Impossible movies the road not taken' would,0.09009664
have been an interesting idea to explore further perhaps throughout the entire film but maybe,0.038865514
in the next movie right as I said I think Christopher McQuarrie has done all,0.04680944
that he can here and they should bring in somebody else and hopefully that person,0.12514521
recognizes that these movies maybe aren't as successful because audiences don't emotionally connect with the,0.06738572
character of Ethan Hunt instead they spend the movie being in awe of Tom Cruise,0.08271423
and hey the guy's awfully impressive he deserves our our awe right I mean and,0.24247432
this might be the ultimate Tom Cruise movie but I'd like to add that Tom,0.077772304
Cruise is very funny very charming very handsome and a very good actor he's more,0.14996448
than just stunts and I think it would serve him well to remember that I,0.11125393
mean he's made a lot of movies don't involve any stunts but he seems to,0.10772173
have drifted away from that maybe you might want to consider circling back and bringing,0.11581369
that element into these movies all right so that's my review my spoiler review of,0.10533344
Mission Impossible fallout I'm very excited to discuss the movie with you down below both,0.36399907
with you but you thought of it and what you would do to improve it,0.08044086
even if you think it's a perfect movie but you can't argue with the lackluster,0.4648533
box office especially if it does open as expected so I think that's a good,0.046918277
exercise from a business perspective to look at these movies from the perspective and the,0.06324248
needs of the studio and also Tom Cruise right I mean he's got to know,0.061095156
he's got to keep growing this thing if he wants it to stick around for,0.13975325
even longer than it has which in itself is impressive so again share those thoughts,0.0690263
down below and of course as always you can check out some more videos right,0.15254673
