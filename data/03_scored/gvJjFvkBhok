stupid the movie instead only ever focuses on the problem at hand where it's focusing,0.8052971
on how it happens why it happens the mentality behind it which is just disgusting,0.54396117
it's scary when you hear about it and a huge emphasis on the effect it,0.062157806

into their characters and you buy them Michael Keaton is in this movie Michael Keaton,0.10296304
kills it as always as this character Rachel McAdams is this movie she kills it,0.6453729
as always Mark Ruffalo also kills it I'd say he was probably the stand out,0.46138176
for me cuz you talking about transformations he was the one who went really really,0.07702241
far into his character and I was just like blown away by Mark Ruffalo every,0.15513904
time he was on screen I'm telling you there's going to be oscar noms thrown,0.22571792
out for this movie and I'm thinking Ruffalo's gonna nab one of those I really,0.18681592
do I mean honestly if I had anything bad to say about this movie it's,0.11685024
just the fact it can be slowed a bit it can just be slow sometimes,0.0776399
which is to be expected when you walk into a two-hour movie that's covering this,0.0705092
subject material that being said never lost me this movie never lost my attention it's,0.117059864
one of those movies that's so engrossing and interesting that once you start watching it,0.09298154
you just you're in it you're in it you have to sometimes snap out it,0.25604752
to remind yourself you're in a theater because it's one of those movies that can,0.13609746
keep your attention from the second and opens to the second those credits roll and,0.09729331
even with this movie a little bit afterwards so yeah applause so in the end,0.25064635

can make some uncomfortable but I implore all of you to go see it because,0.14797506
this is an important movie and a phenomenal one at that also I'm telling you,0.12649141
