hey everyone it's Alexander the real mr. Robinson welcome to my channel and this is,0.021909818
my review for singing in the rain which is another first-time viewing experience considering that,0.016875044
there's nothing happening out there right now so this is a movie about Hollywood pretty,0.032653864
much and more specifically it takes place during the era of Hollywood where silent movies,0.028987372
are starting to transition into sound our main character is Donald Lockwood played by Gene,0.033473372
Kelly and he is the lead in a film that's being made as a silent,0.0482624
film but during this transitional period because of that scene in the jazz singer the,0.016269062
production shuts down and the movie has to be retooled to be a talking picture,0.088350356
and the movie pretty much follows lockwood his vaudeville partner and best friend played by,0.019654846
Donald O'Connor and a young up-and-coming actress played by Debbie Reynolds as they try to,0.06677513
work to save the movie and retool it to be a talking film so in,0.037183102
the same way I talked about Casablanca yesterday singing in the rain is another movie,0.02397854
that I have never seen up until now but it's such an iconic movie that,0.026410451
I can recognize a reference to singing in the rain when I see it more,0.023545505
specifically the famous scene where Gene Kelly is dancing to singing in the rain because,0.022105383
there was actually a lot about this movie that to be honest I didn't expect,0.026009345
for one thing I didn't expect this movie to take place in the time period,0.028089374
that it takes place this movie came out in 1952 and I assumed that it,0.056741495
would be a movie set in the 50s but I was surprised to find out,0.021762813
that it was actually set in the 20s during the silent film era and that,0.011227635
it was truly about Hollywood because I literally had no idea of what the plot,0.03385452
to this movie was which to be honest is actually one of my disappointments with,0.05297456
the movie and it's not really with the movie itself it's just more like the,0.023092516
circumstances of when I saw this movie because again this is the first time I've,0.033485346
ever seen singing in the rain with no prior knowledge of it outside of the,0.022355491
cast and the iconic dancing scene but when I was watching this movie and watching,0.030352995
the plot go along and unfolded I thought to myself this is the artist this,0.031733252
is the plot of the artist where it takes place in the silent era of,0.03235919
film and it's during that transitional period where silent movies are actually starting to die,0.2066047
out in favor of talking pictures and again this is not a fair criticism towards,0.03857267
singing in the rain because singing in the rain came first 59 years to be,0.01644733
exact but because I saw the artist first the plot to sing in the rain,0.01684644
just didn't really leave me with many surprises and to be honest I thought the,0.019588994
artist was actually a lot more compelling in terms of its characters but again that's,0.018480796
not a fair criticism towards singing in the rain at all because it technically was,0.029072516
the first movie that came out and by comparing the two movies you could clearly,0.04157664
tell that singing in the rain was a big influence in the making of the,0.025305582
artist right down to the fact that Gene Kelly and John Dujardin look identical in,0.026137726
fact a lot of times when I was watching singing in the rain I kept,0.02944768
expecting a French accent to come out of Gene Kelly because he looked so much,0.1122085
like Jean Dujardin or more accurately Jean Dujardin looked a lot like Gene Kelly and,0.022406045
I have some other problems with the movie that I think are legit criticisms but,0.031297557
I don't want to talk about those quite yet because this movie is really good,0.05195816
this is a lot of fun and when people say that this is one of,0.030235257
the greatest if not the greatest dance movie out there I could definitely believe that,0.041237395
and it all has to come down to your main three actors especially Gene Kelly,0.08622243
Gene Kelly dancing in this movie is the stuff of legends he has energy in,0.04476686
him he is able to take whatever's around him whether it's certain parts of the,0.024132863
set or certain props and use those to his advantage to enhance the dancing and,0.054704703
it is just this sounds corny but it's magical to watch him dance and dancing,0.12786026
a way to where it looks like he's never tired you just have to wonder,0.052671902
how many takes did he and the others have to do in order to get,0.030752106
those dancing sequences right because that's got to be exhausting Donald O'Connor is really good,0.046728484
in the movie and he manages to keep up with Gene Kelly in terms of,0.025562342
dancing but honestly in terms of a character Donald O'Connor just didn't really leave that,0.022302942
much of an impression on me unlike Debbie Reynolds who is very good in this,0.056446154
movie as well and she also manages to stay toe to toe with Gene Kelly,0.03654785
in terms of the performances and I think she's might be my second favorite character,0.025683405
in the movie another fantastic actress in this movie is Jean Hagen as Donald Lockwood's,0.11096328
co-star in the movie that they're making and this is one of those characters where,0.011875523
I can't stand her because her voice in the movie is the equivalent of Quint,0.114247285
scratching on a chalkboard and you just can't stand this woman she is irritating she's,0.3403391
obnoxious and yet she is very very funny and one of the big plot points,0.23095436
in this movie is that she has such an obnoxious voice a voice that is,0.26714236
not made for talking pictures that Debbie Reynolds character actually had to dub her over,0.06767645
because the test audiences were laughing at her natural voice and what's really interesting and,0.021104282
ironic about that is that the sequences where Debbie Reynolds is dubbing over Jean Hagen's,0.04687948
character is actually Hagen's natural voice so that's pretty impressive and I just recently found,0.048845764
out before doing this review that gene Hagen was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at,0.06580862
the Oscars and yeah with the situation like that that's a nomination well deserved now,0.044422958
I did mention earlier that I had some other issues with this movie which is,0.022781875
why I'm not gonna give it my highest rating get off your ass and go,0.8416842
see it right now and this criticism is honestly another one that I can't really,0.022742629
blame the movie for because with this criticism you got taken to context the time,0.041856017
that this movie was made and that's the first time that Gene Kelly and Debbie,0.03431483
Reynolds are on screen Gene Kelly is running from a bunch of really crazy fans,0.20804217
he jumps on one of the trolleys and jumps into the passenger seat of Debbie,0.040947374
Reynolds car and she's freaking out naturally you got some weird random stranger jumping into,0.16227221
her car perfectly but then when she finds out that he's a famous actor she's,0.079366386
calm she's relaxed and there are several points during this first meeting where Gene Kelly,0.021538647
has his around her and he's getting really close to her and I'm just like,0.024428869
oh no not good not good that is you just met this woman stay back,0.13209483
man too too soon and again this is something I really can't blame the movie,0.030045016
for it's just the fact that I first watched this movie in a post me,0.03570107
too era and it just felt a little creepy watching it in the era that,0.08259386
we're in right now and then there's also one dancing sequence in this movie that,0.020637322
I felt was totally unnecessary it's a sequence where Gene Kelly is describing to the,0.03730217
studio head the one final scene that they need to make for the movie and,0.039640956
it's told to this giant what-if scenario and again it's an amazing dance sequence but,0.032592002
I felt like it wasn't natural to the plot and it was just put in,0.04662871
there for filler but outside of that there is absolutely no denying that this is,0.04860896
a great film it's an incredible dance movie the entire singing in the rain sequence,0.032710407
is iconic the performances are fantastic it's a lot of fun to watch it's funny,0.056625754
even though I'm not gonna give it my highest rating it's still a movie that,0.032040566
if you love classic film it's worth seeing in her lifetime it's not my favorite,0.09356673
musical out there I still love movies like West Side Story or Sound of Music,0.014171072
a lot more than I do singing in the rain but there is absolutely no,0.021102952
denying that this movie is fantastic and iconic in its own ways and there you,0.054859027
go that's my review for singing in the rain and much like with Casablanca this,0.03755627
is another movie that Turner Classic Movies is showing on their classic film festival special,0.0366157
home edition so if you want to see this movie for the first time or,0.029441694
again you've got no better chance then later today so now I want to know,0.05413065
what you guys think about this movie if you've seen it what did you think,0.035782225
do you think my criticisms of the movie are invalid or unfair whatever the case,0.019842427
