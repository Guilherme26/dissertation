too late enough of that let's get right into the good look good now let's,0.032021277
start off by talking about the animation in this movie it's a pretty slick 3d,0.11005264
style that almost has the motion of old-school claymation despite not being the most traditional,0.039281756
style of animation that many people might be accustomed to it definitely works exceptionally well,0.01628303
for the movie this animation helps accentuate different aspects of the movie more so from,0.017925369
a visual standpoint more specifically the film flows in and out of different kinds of,0.013163985
animation styles at times but in a very subtle way what I appreciated the most,0.042832505
was how at different times the film would just turn into a motion comic book,0.025907572
having that literal comic book element really helps to add that unique touch that comic,0.052741747
book readers are also familiar with the animation serves to be more of a practical,0.012613213
medium to deliver on some of the more heavy concepts and themes if this weren't,0.048822485
an animated movie it would be really hard to imagine some of the sci-fi elements,0.07064716
working in a live-action setting so rather than having to watch live actors in a,0.041745596
movie full of crazy CGI effects it becomes a lot easier for the audiences to,0.10126423
buy into more of these psychedelic visual effects in this film now one of my,0.060662754
biggest concerns going into this movie was whether or not this was really going to,0.03139467
be a Miles Morales story or not luckily it was as you could probably see,0.018568601
in the trailer there are a number of other characters in the film while I,0.011334729
would have preferred more screen time for miles the time share wasn't all that bad,0.032963175
while they each have their own fun and unique moments to shine none of them,0.052270796
truly steal the spotlight away from miles as character you'll love the way miles learns,0.07699235
about his powers and discovers what it truly takes to become a hero another surprising,0.035572693
win for this movie with a really cool action sequence is that it had if,0.027867204
you happen to see the post-credit scene in venom then you'll already know what I'm,0.07310302
referring to as for the drama this movie does have its fair share of feels,0.02356413
- it was great to see how this spider man film was able to tap,0.07211988
into the core elements that make the spider-man character so rich and deep even if,0.026759673
you happen to know the outcome of certain situations for some characters it won't matter,0.0344625
it doesn't take much to feel the pain loss and other emotional challenges that the,0.013649568
characters endure thankfully this movie wasn't a total downer and that's because it was actually,0.034020152
pretty funny I suppose that is to be expected given the fact that Lord and,0.022146624
Miller had a hand in making this film if you're a fan of the past,0.038036533
spider-man movies then get ready to laugh your butt off as this film pokes fun,0.52680504
at the spider-man movie franchise and drops a number of funny callback references don't laugh,0.020667257
too hard though because you may miss out on some of the jokes seriously even,0.054342177
the lyrics to the outro credits are pretty funny and before I forget the soundtrack,0.018530685
for this movie was just perfect the music transitions seamlessly at different moments to amplify,0.03285342
the setting or mood during scenes better yet every song sounds like something Miles Morales,0.01840031
would actually listen to as a result both the music and the main character become,0.015039137
a bit more relatable now besides having the comedy the drama and the action it's,0.044424955
really the characters that serve to be the backbone of this movie shameik Moore was,0.06715096
perfectly cast as Miles Morales and Jake Johnson was an ideal fit for this version,0.060699336
of Peter Parker that he portrays I think the potential fan favorites that literally got,0.0105637815
me to laugh out loud will come from Nicolas Cage and John Mulaney spider-man characters,0.061953876
okay enough of that let's get right into the bad the bad now the only,0.09149534
issue I really have with this movie stemmed primarily from well the animation that I,0.0367188
praised earlier while it is vibrant and colorful there's a bit of blurriness that occurs,0.08045596
throughout the movie the best way to describe it would be like if you ever,0.07087532
walked into a 3d movie and forgot to put your 3d glasses on I'm pretty,0.213055
sure this blurriness was done intentionally since it does maintain the character on screen to,0.0227413
be in full focus either way it's just a little bit distracting at times okay,0.15182151
enough of that let's get right into the reason the reason spider-man into the spider,0.08053578
