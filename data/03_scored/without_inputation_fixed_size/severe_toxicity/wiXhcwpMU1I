a boy who really wants to be a musician he looks up to arnesto dela,0.13118087
Cruz the most famous musician he knows of he has a special attic hideaway dedicated,0.1978336
to this musician where he watches old VHS tapes of dela Cruz's performances he wants,0.18849841
so much to be a musician like him one day but his family would prefer,0.03503589
that he makes shoes for a living because that's what all of his relatives have,0.030068297
done music is pretty much banned in his family so one day he decides to,0.067305274
steal or nesto dela Cruz his guitar from his grave and in so doing finds,0.5086756
himself in the land of the dead there he must try to find his passed,0.1378041
away relatives to try to connect with them and figure out why exactly music is,0.034587555
viewed as a curse on his family and see if there's any way that he,0.2813751
can do what he wants to do with his life while still pleasing his family,0.16435358
I stayed away from most marketing materials with this film I had seen the first,0.01710187
teaser I think at a movie I was forced to watch it and I didn't,0.03247227
really know anything about the film so it was really nice to watch it unfold,0.027882503
and see this adventure blossom and be really surprised consistently by a very moving and,0.021071687
touching film Pixar is really known for making you cry and I would say for,0.15405786
myself for the majority of the movie I was just enjoying the experience the final,0.02669116
10 minutes though I heard people crying all around me in the theater I heard,0.08938139
people blowing their noses everyone was just really affected by the last 10 minutes of,0.24117883
this movie and it's because it takes its time to build up a credible story,0.023878098
with a family and a backstory and real history and actual pathos like you feel,0.14326127
like you are stepping into a big story that's already happened and few films are,0.030250557
able to accomplish that especially animated films a film that feels like it has history,0.021286542
like it happened before the movie started like these characters existed in this world before,0.03592657
the film began and that's one of the best things about Coco the music is,0.0113460375
also wonderful the guitar work the singing it all sounds really beautiful these are things,0.0649911
you've come to expect with Pixar it's a cliche for me to say this movie,0.071874425
is gorgeously animated it is it's insanely detailed and there were specific shots of city,0.1603811
structure and streets and the cobblestone walkways that just looked photorealistic and if someone were,0.042803902
to tell me they actually are photorealistic and they just inserted animated characters into this,0.16465756
architecture I'd be like that makes sense because that's the level that Pixar is at,0.026729075
now computer animation has come so far it's mind-boggling now there was a film that,0.034343433
came out in 2014 called the book of life this film had similar themes we,0.018738223
had a young character whose family wanted him to be a bullfighter and he had,0.03833919
a passion for it and he was good at it but he also had other,0.06528312
things that he wanted to do with his life and he wasn't sure the path,0.015833367
he wanted to take and it was kind of about him bouncing what he wanted,0.05548031
to do with his life and love and it also revolved around the Day of,0.054196503
the Dead celebration and so some people have said hey Pixar you're ripping off the,0.22998396
book of life having actually seen both of the films I can say that the,0.03149711
stories are fairly different and I wouldn't say any ripping off or copying has occurred,0.04654689
it's just that they have similar themes and they both take place during the Day,0.018794764
of the Dead celebration and so inevitably they will be compared they've also come out,0.08194797
in a fairly short time span I feel like if you love the book of,0.02147878
life it's gonna be really hard to not think about that movie while watching Coco,0.047490787
if you were disappointed in that film though Coco might be that one where you,0.043403897
go okay there they got some things right this film is thematically rich it has,0.04625022
a lot of good surprises as well from a story standpoint it has characters that,0.011090607
I can see people especially young kids really appreciating it is however a little familiar,0.04310523
in its storytelling basically because it's another story about a young kid who wants to,0.018269269
do something with his life and his family wants them to do something else and,0.04485932
he has to find it within him to appreciate both sides and it's a good,0.030885141
message for kids but it did feel strikingly familiar at times especially since the book,0.021827336
of life came out three years ago that's really my biggest issue with Coco is,0.025295604
that as a story it's really beautiful and very touching but it didn't really wrap,0.027053684
me into it and I didn't feel all that invested in the characters despite the,0.015859308
fact that it's so well told and really beautifully directed it doesn't have as investing,0.027281176
a story as I would have liked because it does feel like other things we've,0.021992302
seen before but still this is a good movie and it's well done and the,0.02685679
music and the animation and the voice work is all really good I'm gonna give,0.039589737
Koko a B+ I hope you guys check this one out if you are looking,0.056931738
forward to it it's definitely worth your time it just is a little familiar and,0.026603354
it's storytelling we've seen these types of themes before beyond that it's it's definitely worth,0.026661891
checking out and I would see it in theaters guys thank you so much as,0.0911714
