dearest Queen you are mad,0.6216434
giving me a palace,0.15113723
it is a monstrous extravagance,0.36247677
this is Molly,0.07125889
we are at war we won what is not over you must continue,0.15250142
so this may possibly be the oddest film I ever seen the favorite struggles to fully flesh out both,0.06394399
its comedic and robotic side and leaves it as an odd last scene with several shots cross spinning into each other not being aware of your girl utmost style of filmmaking,0.48627427
I was taken by surprise a minute i sat down in the cinema expecting a funny period drama with astonishing Olivia Colman backed by Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz,0.15176511
I was instead given a dark and twisted dramatic comedy and the struggle and fight between stone and Weiss's characters as they aim to please Queen Anne played by Olivia Colman and becoming her favorite,0.2532413
you have become close to Abigail,0.13389784
she is a Viper you're jealous,0.31089434
well I felt that the story didn't wasn't really fleshed out in any way,0.050181482
I didn't really understand maybe it was just above my level of understanding it just left me,0.054229856
wondering what the heck,0.4461505
I just spent two like hours of watching,0.09347513
I did read a review on Rotten Tomatoes and someone said it was like smoking a Jurgis lung tumors joint and you're just like,0.2703894
hi for about two hours not really sure what's going on and that's pretty much what I felt the minute like the credits started rolling same time,0.07873157
even though I was completely confused and actually just like what did I just watch I was also very astonished by the non-commercial take on period dramas the way that this film just come plays out,0.06523573
it's very different to any other pure drama which kind of interested me and made me more interested in looking into more of yoga slant sinners films and now that I'm more aware of his style of filmmaking I'm gonna be less surprised and less weirded out about what the hell is happening and watching that film The Last of Us uses extreme humor which a liver Coleman is amazing actually is just fantastic,0.3299514
there is that one scene that has been doing,0.070599936
its rounds on Twitter where Queen Anne just goes up to this little servant boy it was like did you look at me,0.29958978
and he's like shakes,0.08109505
his head,0.31089434
she's like did you look at me,0.29955077
look at me,0.07342833
have you looked at her since I've talked you down,0.18618952
I'll get me and it's like she just plays it so freakin well laughter,0.46064666
Moses we really really odd fish I shot and hiring a loud sound track to create one of the oddest but most fascinating films I've ever seen the acting is probably the best thing and the what stood out the most to me throughout this film and Coleman and amis own are comedic geniuses,0.15271437
I just loved Emma Stone in general like I'm a big fan of her I've been a big fan of her since like easy a Crazy Stupid Love,0.74504143
so like a good couple of five six seven years,0.05948606
yeah she's just incredible and Olivia Colman is someone who's like come into my life recently and I'm quite excited to see what she can do with the cream in the crown because that it's got a completely different role to you like what I've seen her doing before because it's a very serious,0.20963582
the queen is very very different to what she is usually like Olivia Colman,0.283384
and of course Rachel Weisz is probably one of the most amazing and underrated actresses that we have and I'm very excited to see more of her because once I watch the film I can get a little bit obsessed with people,0.13617007
and I start watching like all over their films,0.20198964
and I think a Rachel Weisz is the one I'm gonna go into next and just watch pretty much all of our films because some of them are pretty freakin amazing,0.29491028
I just feel that together,0.06004309
these three my like million actresses,0.09102672
they kind of like tie it together because even though I don't feel that the film is completely fleshed out either through,0.06307183
it's like comedic side or it's dramatic side I just feel that the actors kind of just like take it and run with it and manage to like create something really really good especially Emma Stone a little bit comb and I'm just a genius is that the comedic side and then Rachel Weisz just comes in with a dramatic and the really really intense and really really sassy and she's just like together and they're just like really really good,0.27355832
but in general like the film in general to me just felt - I was too aware that I was watching the fit when I was too aware that was science and watching the screen with this drama played out and it didn't really feel real I like when you get like completely engrossed in the film and you can't forget that you're watching something and you just like imagine yourself but this is actually playing out in front of,0.07969873
you and it's not just a film I just feel that with the really loud those really really loud music like really really hard by beating or like slamming of string instruments of piano and it's very Howlin very very loud,0.267461
and that along law the fisheye lenses and the fisheye shots it just kind of takes away from the experience of being engrossed in a film and you're just very very aware that you are in the cinema watching you film and there's people around you,0.11712358
and I didn't really get that I didn't really get sucked into the film which is something I love about go to the cinemas and just like sit there two hours and yet completely sucked in to film,0.46164498
but with the favorite,0.043207504
I just never really felt that it was I was just constantly thinking what the heck is going on,0.35589275
I do not really understand this,0.13043927
and I was just constantly confused to be honest,0.08564303
I just think that to enjoy the favor like I watched the trailer and it looked hilarious but once I was in the cinema and watched like the films playing out there were any real light laugh-out-loud moments because the funny moments had already been in the trailer and I hate when they do that I hate when like all the fun bits or all the like iconic bits are in the trailer doesn't really lead you into like getting anything else when you actually watch the film and I think to be able to enjoy it,0.15288489
you cannot go in there expecting a funny period drama,0.31089434
it's a completely different stories,0.042445585
it's a completely different genre and lanten was just like takes period drama and just like deconstruct it and just makes it a new thing so it's literally just it looks like a period drama but it's got none of the same tones,0.10624841
and it's just a very odd piece of cinema isn't it in general,0.07078771
I was just left with utter confusion battle by the odd film that I had just witnessed,0.054211218
and I also I was like sat there,0.028432768
as the credits started rolling as like these file shots for just like merging into each other,0.1616716
and I was just thinking what did I what what happened,0.053383365
how did it end,0.07723467
I didn't really like it took me a while I had to like really think about it to realize to understand how it ended but it was oops my hair is all crazy,0.31090412
it was an odd experience,0.06940235
I just like me my friend just kind of just looked at each other just laughing like what the hell does not I feel but I put on my would watch journalist I probably never would watch that,0.32257184
but I am and she to watch lobster and also killing your secret dear,0.7960942
the lobster looks incredible,0.0694547
it looks really really good but yeah with us being in award season the Golden Globes just passed and I didn't actually watch the Globes I was too I hadn't even watched any of the films or the TV shows so I just didn't feel it was worth staying up until 5:00 a.m. to watch the globe's but being in the word season this film was nominated five Golden Globes,0.05029551
and I do believe it's gonna pick up a couple of nominations both in the sags and at the Oscars,0.10169833
I don't think it's worth winning,0.115069374
maybe like the performances both Olivia Colman and Emma Stone are incredible in it I think Olivia Colman will be picking up a couple of nomination don't really feel like it's the strongest for performances of the ones,0.08518113
I've seen so far and the film in general isn't not strong,0.045473933
and if you compare it to all the other films so definitely better films that came out last year that deserve to win and deserve the nomination,0.12113635
and that's just my take on it,0.068245724
I know a lot of like proper like film geeks and film cinema files and all of those people probably enjoyed it but this was just a little bit too far above my level of interest I'm usually not a big fan of period dramas,0.11331236
but this look we need to be funny and it looked interesting,0.05968215
but once I was in that cinema it didn't live up to my expectations and it was on the best a film I've ever seen,0.09351395
but yeah that is my little review,0.06483119
that's my take on a favorite,0.057352882
this is the first video of roll the credits,0.1250028
I hope you enjoyed it,0.18590634
and hopefully the background will change a little bit and be a little bit more film related,0.11109851
