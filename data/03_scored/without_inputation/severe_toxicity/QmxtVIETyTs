the first movies to be released in color and presents a timeless story with iconic,0.01852071
characters and songs it reminds me of the animated features that would be released by,0.011633397
walt disney which is a reasonable comparison because this was made as a direct response,0.028674072
to walt disney's snow white in the seven dwarfs for something that had production troubles,0.0663361
and a less than stellar box office performance it's amazing that the wizard of oz,0.040892165
has remained in the pop culture discussion so as a person who constantly talks about,0.028076071
movies it's about time i talk about this 1939 victor fleming classic that everybody has,0.052080553
already referenced at this point you've always had the power to go back to kansas,0.046728484
excuse me why didn't you tell her before because she wouldn't have believed me are,0.06468246
you out of your mind and i think i'll miss you most of all scarecrow,0.3179824
oh okay it's kind of an odd thing to say yeah sort of a weird,0.17209698
comment right in front of all of us kind of thought this was a team,0.027695587
effort yeah dorothy is accompanied only by a batch of what can ultimately be called,0.035068482
fully emasculated male figures a fragile impotent lion an effeminate scarecrow a fae tin man,0.47471267
a brain a heart my own apartment and what was her sister a princess the,0.08935545
wizard of oz and like i said at the beginning everyone has already watched and,0.01657571
talked about this movie before every person has seen this important cinematic triumph right i,0.060551003
feel like this makes an appearance in everybody's childhood but there's not too many who,0.02188055
return to it with a new perspective as an adult my journey to oz has,0.03664763
changed over time obviously i loved it as a kid it had its creepy moments,0.12643744
the unforgettable songs the memorable makeup i lived near the judy garland museum in grand,0.045521844
rapids minnesota and visited it more than once one time the living munchkin actors were,0.20953152
signing autographs and meeting people the ruby slippers would be given to the museum every,0.044408325
summer until they were mysteriously stolen they've since been found but the fbi still hasn't,0.037116583
released the full details of that story i vividly remember when scooby-doo came out in,0.073060445
2002 we were at the theater in grand rapids and a terrible tornado-like storm was,0.03625118
rolling through reminiscent of the movie and just across the street there was the judy,0.033833236
garland house i really felt like we were going to be taken away to oz,0.10385047
like a lot of viewers i held on to my early memories but never gave,0.036625676
it another watch until we did a section on populism for a civics class in,0.031487796
high school because it's been argued that the whole film is a populist allegory watching,0.021221355
it again it feels like things dragged a lot more than i remembered some of,0.055237517
the effects felt pretty cheap and some things felt plain stupid like at one point,0.28667843
the lion gets a second solo song number but the scarecrow and tin man only,0.09239201
got one but what's that all about was it part of bert lars contract was,0.016822495
he that impressive of a singer well 80 years later it just leaves people puzzled,0.050322473
the monkeys were dumb the run time felt long and the whole charade felt like,0.274307
a huge plot hole why didn't glenda just tell dorothy to use the shoe's magic,0.111800075
to wish herself home all along this was a kids movie for sure and it,0.06028892
was only intended for kids i wasn't as cynical as a lot of teenagers become,0.07340501
but my reaction to the wizard of oz was a low point for me i,0.026212227
have revisited it multiple times since if not yearly in fact it happens to be,0.027984276
on my fiance's list of favorite films and our first date was catching a re-release,0.024699599
of it in theaters so i know this one very well from knowing that the,0.01845552
actor who was going to play the tin man was replaced because he was allergic,0.112891644
to the makeup to the gun the scarecrow is holding in one shot now in,0.29133737
crystal clear high definition and before you ask no i don't think an actor playing,0.018626472
a munchkin hung themself that was caught on camera it's a crane a living bird,0.40583068
on set you can easily see it on anything that's not a vhs from a,0.027380954
technical standpoint the wizard of oz is a marvel to look at so many interesting,0.01916261
techniques were done to bring this world to life but to push themselves even further,0.12056786
they expanded the use of the technicolor process while making it an integral part of,0.022783205
the story the opening scenes take place in kansas in sepia tone a stylized looking,0.02763306
black and white but in oz everything becomes color and to achieve this shot they,0.012238714
actually had a stunt double in a sepia tone dress in the house painted in,0.028656112
brown and white and when she opens the door to us judy garland walks into,0.010670876
frame as a fully realized color dorothy it's moments like this that make you appreciate,0.050456174
the work that they went to for what amounts to about 10 seconds of screen,0.04811007
time especially when they have this silly edited cut only a few minutes later they're,0.36260757
gone the makeup is still out of this world i can't believe this is only,0.052637313
1939 because i somehow perfected the look of these characters so much it makes me,0.030856539
wonder why even modern cinema can't make the fantasy designs look as good as they,0.011596812
do here the scarecrow makeup in particular looks almost like a potato sack you'd see,0.26308614
in a real life scarecrow i still can't comprehend how it was done the story,0.08113245
is classic the traditional journey where out of this world personalities are met along the,0.034247644
way it takes a simple idea and invests all of its worth into telling it,0.045742683
well everyone has distinct charisma this was at a time when hollywood was really into,0.018343104
the waltz and tap dancing popcorn flicks which oz takes a lot of inspiration from,0.026507568
yet with the backgrounds and this set design things never feel dated even some of,0.019616265
the cheesier effects have a charm to them that fit the tone of everything else,0.060470514
and even if it's noticeable there's at least 10 other great special effects to follow,0.029128391
it up with that will blow your mind this utilizes pyrotechnics miniatures forced perspective animatronics,0.114305824
wires and so much more it transports you in a way that very few movies,0.038994394
have been able to replicate the songs are good but i have a few comments,0.018190777
the opening number has become a staple of american culture but i probably prefer nearly,0.095310174
every other cover of this song rather than the original judy garland is good don't,0.021365698
get me wrong but this is the only performance that feels of the time the,0.03772988
munchkinland melody is rapid and bouncy hopping between different styles and vocals as a huge,0.07003187
portion of the backstory is explained through song it's the moment where the munchkins really,0.03226939
get to shine and for becoming such big icons in their own right you kind,0.048649535
of forget that this is the only scene where they appear if i only had,0.024353703
a brain works for the different characters who replaced brain with heart or nerve but,0.07849566
i'm not really a fan of king of the forest like i said just feels,0.03207316
a bit overblown for an actor in a movie that wasn't really about showcasing the,0.07512584
famous actors and their talents at the time we're off to see the wizard is,0.008559583
of course the most addictive piece ever created and must be saying anytime you're with,0.06661415
a group of friends walking in a horizontal lineup the witch still freaks me out,0.40379626
to this day there's something about that extremely green skin and the voice that terrifies,0.11664262
me more than any horror villain would finding out that margaret hamilton was a schoolteacher,0.097334996
doesn't really help to improve things think about it would you want this actress disciplining,0.043621413
you in the 1930s the wizard was really disturbing as a kid too even with,0.059060324
the reveal of the true man behind the curtain i still couldn't forget that floating,0.038778875
alien looking head where did they even come up with that design surprisingly a lot,0.12470797
of the humor still works today and there's even a few things that only an,0.020570138
older audience would notice like the fortune teller in kansas who's obviously duping dorothy into,0.023512246
running back home you also notice that the kansas farmers look an awful lot like,0.06226518
the actors who played the main characters in oz there's things that just make you,0.015745562
laugh that may not be intentional like how matter-of-fact glenda is after the wicked witch,0.2591774
of the east is killed she has such a bubbly personality even though a murder,0.51143724
just occurred when they get out of the poppy field this old timey boppity music,0.048167944
starts up and the characters stop and start dancing along as if they can also,0.024815341
hear it is it's not just for the audience or does the music play for,0.010275092
anyone who's entering the city of oz it's not as funny when you realize that,0.041718323
that snow in the background is actually asbestos and of course by far the best,0.02537609
part is that epic window jump the lion does he runs down the longest hallway,0.050641097
in existence breaks through the glass of the window and it fades to black we,0.055297382
don't even see what happens or if he gets injured they just cut to the,0.14288078
next scene i'm kind of surprised this turned out as perfect as it did it,0.05701555
had quite a few interesting production tidbits like the tin man actor who got replaced,0.11003468
dorothy starting out with a blonde wig and margaret hamilton sustaining third-degree burns from a,0.23009871
failed pyrotechnic stunt the craziest part is the number of directors they went through they,0.20261428
started out with norman tarag who did some of the test footage he was replaced,0.10380922
by richard thorpe who only shot for nine days and shot the only footage of,0.2768989
buddy epson as the tin man he was replaced by george cuccor after mervyn leroy,0.20572667
was unhappy with the footage but kukor left after only making a few creative choices,0.04813934
at this point most of the finished shots had to be redone and victor fleming,0.08211759
came in so kukor could go back to working on gun with the wind fleming,0.21886803
is the final credited director but to my surprise as of this writing i discovered,0.01519346
yet another director came on after fleming left to replace kukor again on of all,0.032650538
things gone with the wind king vidor only directed some of the kansas scenes but,0.06144767
in total the wizard of oz had four directors they should make a movie just,0.0116021335
about the making of this movie regardless this is a 5 out of 5 star,0.06918043
movie if you ask me and the themes are effective even today i guess you,0.024065014
can call it simplistic with its morals but i think that's why they remain timeless,0.034065384
the gifts received at the end are not what the characters were specifically seeking but,0.015661083
they represent everything gained from the journey including knowledge kindness and courage the gifts are,0.010796595
only tokens possessed by the types of people they aspire to be but along the,0.05853882
way they already achieved them the idea of there being no place like home has,0.042203907
become a comforting sentiment i don't think it really means that a person should never,0.026484951
go beyond the world they've grown up in dorothy already went on the journey even,0.0323991
if it's considered a dream but after all the excitement it's good to relax in,0.019330237
a setting you're familiar with how do i recommend something that everyone's already seen well,0.039544504
if it's been a few years i say go watch it again you might be,0.047677703
surprised by just how good it still is and there might be a few things,0.031750545
that you catch that i haven't even caught yet some of those smaller details if,0.04809677
you're a fan of cinema that uses special effects to tell its story this is,0.042831175

wide range of different special effects wizardry they have a huge debt to pay to,0.014409208
