what up peeps Tony Baker here back with another movie review this time,0.07662714
I'm reviewing the irishman martin scorsese the epic netflix saga that they slid out to theaters this three it's three and a half hours long guys but it reunited him with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci once again we all know they made magic with casino and Goodfellas,0.11292854
there's a straight magic Goodfellas is easily hands-down,0.14540695
one of my favorite movies of all time,0.05117506
so it's my by default my favorite Martin Scorsese movie Robert DeNiro plays Frank Sheeran who's a you know real life character who you know worked with mob you know we're very closely with Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci who they brought out of retirement for this,0.1703643
joint,0.051643807
Joe Pesci's been shelling,0.15347794
he's been I'm out the game this one,0.18109304
I think I'm out,0.07861647
they pull me back,0.109043926
they blue leave a key and they say like Robert and Martin had to really convince him to come do this movie that must be nice man,0.06470599
you,0.10154687
when you're good,0.06204143
you just walk away from the game for years,0.18812835
be like,0.0330545
I don't know like you're settled,0.23652427
you said,0.06861072
you don't need,0.13448176
the money whatever and then you can demand whatever you want if legs look give me seven million dollars to do this movie,0.25695446
and Netflix like we had money this movie costs a hundred and fifty million dollars to me a hundred and fifty million dollars for drama,0.07179927
this is ridiculous man man,0.76976806
yeah I bet you Joe was like give me 75 million dollars,0.13422827
and there's our joke come on,0.10946589
please Netflix man we bottomed the Soviet baby man three and a half hours 150 million this is better be good excuse,0.25858012
my language but man you know,0.08895184
and the critics loved it,0.08034143
they was like yo,0.091907926
this is a masterpiece,0.07225601
oh and how can I forget who else is in this Al Pacino,0.07761275
so you got Alba Chino Robert De Niro Joe Pesci in one move I'm saying the last time Al Pacino or Robert De Niro all together real righteous kill,0.63623923
we just go forget about that that movie was hot guy hot righteous,0.43447635
kill was a hot garbage,0.7093121
it was like somebody took some garbage boiled it added some seasoning,0.46569774
you know there's an old here the garbage put in the bowl and served it hot but he that's the Pacino De Niro combo that we all love,0.5817259
so it's good to see them back again,0.10810134
it's really the story about a guy Frank Sheeran he's Irish and he starts doing like you know jobs with mob-connected men he starts you know rising up the ranks doing doing odd jobs or isn't it then kind of doing hits a little bit,0.24185638
you know I want to put a business out there,0.122855805
but you know doing some real dirt and doing what he ever had to do for them,0.2790512
essentially it's like I'll do it,0.06683135
I'll do it,0.046263866
I'll do it,0.046263866
you know I mean and so you still get that Scorsese you know people getting capped we've come to expect like you know people getting shot up,0.46831024
you know this in here well at three and a half hours it's gonna be the slow pace,0.10607779
it's a slow pace,0.16826086
it's a slow pace like because it goes through all these years ago it goes,0.09314029
and so they're using this special effects thing,0.096847944
the D age,0.105912864
you know the actors and make them look older make them look younger,0.11252115
so they're doing all of this,0.065758415
and some people thought it was distracting,0.08641984
I really didn't bother me too much,0.090417765
I was just like okay I couldn't they never really made,0.08282567
Robert De Niro look young no like,0.1295529
he was supposed to be mad long ago he was still looking old so they were trying to make him look young and they kind of fumbled,0.30781946
now I'm like he's still look old but just smooth the skin that's all it was he was an old man with smooth,0.24156839
skin,0.07691297
it's like yo,0.10471581
this is me in my 20s and he looked like Robert De Niro in his seventies with smooth skin,0.18511325
that's the only the only thing I really saw so basically is that,0.06282626
and you know you you get to see Robert De Niro's family how his daughter looked at him,0.114723295
and I thought that was a really interesting dynamic within the story is just how how his kids viewed what he was doing because a lot of times you don't really see that you see you know these guys have families of course,0.052351084
but you don't really see like a kid that really doesn't like what you're doing and knows it because kids man we out here man we we we see what our parents do and it affects us for them to really play on that I really enjoyed that aspect of it because it was like yo,0.16212088
I don't I don't like what you're doing you know cuz a lot of times kids don't feel like they have any place to say that to their parents or they just hold it in or they just become what their parents were but it's good just to see like I'm not feeling this from a little girl throughout,0.15534987
you know understands just to see that transition Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa,0.08142769
he killed it in this movie he nailed it,0.6680361
you know a lot of times Al Pacino can go over the top,0.06120857
he's been going over the top you know in his later roles,0.1039687
all right man just this dial it back a little bit no I will not you know,0.3522097
but in this it worked because that's the type of person Jimmy Hoffa was but if you look up Jimmy Hoffa like he was fiery like he you know,0.115531914
he got the union's really going like,0.05056877
he was one of the main guys in the country like it was the president then like Jimmy Hoffa,0.08860931
and so what he was doing was really big really important,0.07508222
and so I felt like you needed that type of delivery for Jimmy Hoffa and I thought he nailed it I thought he was a doe very stubborn but a dope character to watch you were all in and you kind of respect how he wasn't scared of the mob,0.29451495
I like to see that even though most of the people in movies they just bow down to the mob you know it was it was interesting to see a character that even though they can hurt you,0.19235942
he still never really backed down,0.13907258
and I thought that was pretty dope Joe Pesci's character you know usually Joe Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie he's the hotheads fireball short Wolverine I kill you right now I kill you what's funny,0.7349439
in my job to you was funny you know just a hot Headz volcano,0.45089987
now he's completely subdued quiet you know still we'll get you cue but it's very like understated quiet,0.1367004
but when he's around you feel the presence of like you know danger like serious business,0.18993294
I can hurt you,0.5967424
I can get things done,0.07224038
and I love how Joe Pesci played it very understated very chill very quiet and it's like yo it works,0.13556619
and so you know a lot of people are clowning it this long and slow but I think they really just focusing on the wrong things like you know even though the the age of fire didn't really work,0.14505981
all right,0.052336607
it didn't work,0.068853
but I could still focus on the story and the performances and I feel like it was a good time I don't I don't agree with what Martin Scorsese said about comic book movies I'm not here for it you know I think comic book movies are great cinema,0.047297657
you know you getting emotions you go in there you're crying you're excited you're on the edge of your seat you're laughing what the hell else,0.61760753
do,0.03680355
you want from movies you going there for to feel something,0.12078553
and you know Marvel movies have been providing that you know Martin every day know I had to be all serious and like you know drawing from real people's,0.13244681
it's about what you connect to the hell,0.5434378
if that's the case you know Shakespeare you know the stuff,0.0860227
he wrote Romeo Giulia there weren't real people but everybody's been connecting with that format long so Martin just chill man let's get these comic-book movies man we having a good time out here in these Marvel streets DC you know - Joker and the Dark Knight not not the Justice League because we all fumble see but man we having a good time with these Marvel movies Martin man you watch it for the last Marvel movie Martin Scorsese watched,0.29978326
cuz I guarantee you if you watch infinity war and endgame man you gonna feel something you know I'm gonna watch him watch it and see how can you not feel this,0.31089434
dunk how can you not connect anyway man y'all want to know the smooth jazz review an Irishman here it,0.14463873
is oh yeah I'm giving the Irishman four saxophones out of five four again four saxophones again what y'all gonna do self is quality though its quality out,0.108611524
I think Martin was just mad cuz Marvel made a three-hour movie he's like I'm the one that's making the three-hour movie oh I can't call alright a piece,0.26779416
