Citizen Kane came out in 1941 and has become one of the most talked-about and,0.06828767
widely referenced films of all time it's so popular and so influential that it's essentially,0.07687097
become a phrase well you know that movie was pretty good but it wasn't Citizen,0.08377413
Kane or anything or you know I wasn't expecting it to be Citizen Kane it,0.070483536
was alright or that film is the Citizen Kane of crime dramas it's so well,0.0998723
known that it's become a part of our pop culture it's become a part of,0.08359708
the way we speak Morrison Welles directed the film he stars in it he took,0.059902884
part in the screenplay and the producing the production of the film was historic at,0.021728834
the time because he was mostly known for his theater work and that's where he,0.04990967
felt most comfortable and that's where he really wanted to maintain himself but Hollywood kept,0.04298287
trying to court him and get him to make films for them and he took,0.21945547
part in a very controversial contract that essentially gave him complete creative control final cut,0.062008705
everything they couldn't have people on set despite the fact that RKO Pictures would sometimes,0.071542785
try to get people on set to see what they were doing he had so,0.061778676
much control something that was unprecedented at the time especially for someone as young as,0.09088933
he was this film in every way could have been a complete financial and critical,0.11204301
disaster and yet it has endured as a classic of our times for some though,0.14285512
Citizen Kane can be a very daunting film to watch or talk about in fact,0.09930912
for me sitting here it's rather imposing just to just make a review of it,0.08858939
because so many other people have analyzed this film from back to front for decades,0.08273038
there's really nothing new that I can say about the movie I can simply tell,0.0607471
you my experience with it and how I've come to really love the film because,0.090049535
when I was younger and I saw it for the first time I just really,0.047844302
didn't get it it didn't really mesh with me you hear so much about this,0.08114953
film and so many people hype it up endlessly it's constantly on lists as one,0.0800439
of the best films of time or the best film ever made many well-known critics,0.12664968
have named it their favorite film and so you sit down expecting to be transported,0.21516824
away to a world in which you are so blown away that you can no,0.40327764
longer speak and you're so hyped and you're so ready and it's just a really,0.19275221
technically well-made film that's masterfully directed and so impressive for what Orson Welles had going,0.06657064
for him at the time in regards to what he had done before or what,0.10507996
he had not done before on a technical level cinematography music this being Bernard Herrmann's,0.083889216
first film score acting story structure it's unprecedented for its time and easily my favorite,0.05035257
film of the 1940s it's such an incredibly well made movie but I can totally,0.10720726
understand how anyone would watch this and say I mean it's good but like why,0.08305265
is everyone say this is the best movie ever made it's kind of boring like,0.20937482
I can totally see people thinking that because it does not follow common story structure,0.11027232
it's not like a enthralling story so to speak it's not like you sit and,0.19323164
watch like 12 Angry Men and you get so invested in these characters despite the,0.15587133
fact that it is an excellent character study and you can look at its story,0.035011955
and its depiction of that excess and see it so many times today a thousand,0.107190065
times over in various celebrities as I was watching the film most recently a couple,0.04985912
days ago to prepare for this review I thought a lot about Michael Jackson and,0.07173556
his Neverland Ranch filled with animals his pet chimpanzee all of the money and random,0.77037936
things he would buy he would buy statues he essentially was a modern-day Citizen Kane,0.082012124
but it's understandable that anyone might watch this film and just not appreciate it because,0.16893944
it's been hyped so much and it's very dangerous for a film to to gain,0.15217178
such notoriety because you watch it expecting to be transported to another planet or something,0.19110303
and it's just a really damn great movie that was far ahead of its time,0.46752644
in regards to what it was trying to do Orson Welles later said one of,0.0797584
my favorite quotes about filmmaking ever when someone asked him how he was so audacious,0.0772947
enough to make a film like this at that point in his life he said,0.1049299
ignorant sheer ignorance you know there's no confidence to equal it it's only when you,0.85318476
know something about a profession I think that you're timid or careful which is so,0.15055053
true when I was a kid making short films we didn't think about the meaning,0.11783797
we didn't wonder what people might think of what we were making because we just,0.107690684
wanted to make it and we didn't care as much about like a response to,0.07827169
it we weren't psychoanalyzing every little thing to make sure that what we were doing,0.12835047
wouldn't potentially be awful we just really wanted to get our vision out there even,0.14503492
if it was really amateur and bad Orson Welles though coming from that theater background,0.2165876
knew how to tell a story and knew how to put something together and he,0.07582072
knew how to make something different that Hollywood hadn't seen at the time I mean,0.072977915
just the fact that the film allows the audience to become a part of the,0.03672521
narrative like early on with the news on the march sequence where we're learning about,0.04382007
the life of Charles Foster Kane we're hearing about his background how he was raised,0.0771996
his Millions his various relationships this was a very unorthodox approach to storytelling and story,0.0653323
structure people I think at first were kind of confused by the movie and it,0.1504612
took a long time for the world to realize how influential the movie actually was,0.06349887
now yes there's a major plot hole in the film that has been discussed a,0.09355945
lot the fact that the film opens with Charles Foster Kane dying and saying the,0.05805492
word rosebud and then starts the entire basic story of the movie this reporter who's,0.11591093
attempting to figure out what rosebud means and so he's visiting all these figures that,0.08393262
were integral to Kane's life trying to figure out if he can get a great,0.081825554
story to publish about what rosebud means the plot hole being that he died alone,0.26290062
and no one was around and so we're kind of left to believe that perhaps,0.0905748
hit one of his maids or Butler's may have heard him say this and there's,0.24106406
elements to the movie that you can say well that's not good that's not good,0.15298326
there's too much exposition for instance or maybe some of the performances are a little,0.040563345
hammy at times but you just cannot deny the fact that this movie was leaps,0.20105432
and bounds ahead of every other film in its time this movie does not feel,0.08175449
like a movie that was released in 1941 it feels like a film that could,0.067905605
have been made today if you strip away the obvious technical stuff the black and,0.33790264
white and some of the sound and things that obviously identify the time period the,0.15932138
filmmaking the precise cinematography use of cross dissolves the way everything flows so smoothly the,0.07872815
way he moves in the camera in someone when they're having an angry moment or,0.14982893
pulls back when there's a softer moment on display Orson Welles was ahead of his,0.07730284
time he was a perfectionist like all great filmmakers one of his great annoyances with,0.111201875
the movie was that during the snowy scenes early on despite the fact they look,0.063785866
really good you couldn't see the actors breath because it was shot in a studio,0.41343153
and that pissed him off because he's a perfectionist he wants it to be as,0.5449168
good as it can be which is a sign of an excellent filmmaker and and,0.05303122
you can watch this in Kane today and say well I didn't really appreciate that,0.066021234
that wasn't for me and I would understand that because the first time I saw,0.13060036
it when I was younger I didn't really get it it just wasn't for me,0.08292852
but as I got older I kept being drawn to it and I wanted to,0.06025844
see it again I had similar experiences with Blade Runner for instance didn't really appreciate,0.038237244
the movie on first viewing but it just kept festering in my mind and Citizen,0.108531296
Kane is one of those movies and you really can't deny the importance and the,0.08609084
impact fulness of this film I'm gonna give a Citizen Kane and a-plus guys thank,0.15288472
you so much as always for continuing to watch this series of pre-1970s reviews I,0.09141431
have one more to do in December look forward to that as always if you,0.07470963
