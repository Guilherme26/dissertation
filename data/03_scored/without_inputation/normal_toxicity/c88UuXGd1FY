I've been a huge fan of del Toro's for years and the shape of water ranks among his very best and will no doubt lead to tons of award consideration this season like the seven Golden Globes it's already been nominated for del Toro describes us as his most personal film as he has always wanted to make his own version of a classic Universal monster movie in this case he pulled inspiration from The Creature from the Black Lagoon,0.1681459
and the amphibian man's appearance bears more than a little resemblance to the original creature unlike the classic Universal monster movies that inspired him shape of waters,0.1928223
is an antithesis to those classic films where the monsters are treated with some sympathy,0.30659732
but ultimately they are rejected by society as monsters,0.541987
and the only fitting end for them is death the shape of water does the opposite with its amphibian man treating him not as a monster at all but rather a romantic hero,0.31089434
and in fact worthy of love,0.072382234
it's an impressive new spin on those kinds of films which makes it a real bummer to recently learn that del Toro turned down the opportunity to helm universals dark universe,0.103831
can you imagine how perfect that would have been,0.06968185
but instead after the lackluster mummy the dark universe is all over once again before it even got a chance to start but it's probably for the best that he turned it down as the shape of water is holy his own creation done on his own terms,0.17612346
and is all the more successful because of that so let's look at the shape of water exploring the main themes of the film as well as explaining its quite mysterious,0.042540506
ending our story takes place in Baltimore in the 1960s at the height of our Cold War Rasha this time in history is quite a bit different than today with many people marginalized due to what was believed by the then current standards of society women handicapped people black people and gay men are all amongst those that are outcasts by society,0.5154597
and essentially treated as lesser than others unable to reach the same opportunities as others at the time on the opposite spectrum we have the class with the highest status amongst all others the white man and all of these sides are represented via characters in the film seeing through their stories that the ideologies of the time create blind hatred while attempting to understand others even if considered different by society is the antidote to that mentality our main window into,0.08692496
this is via ELISA a young handicapped woman who is found abandoned as a child with three cuts on each side of her neck apparently the results of being attacked which is a pretty horrible thing for a baby to go through because of this injury,0.34981105
she has been mute throughout her life and uses sign language to communicate with others,0.27920496
and this is to literally represent the idea of a woman like her not having a voice or being heard in the current social climate,0.2518811
her being mute as well as a woman affords her little opportunity,0.5154597
and she along with her black friend Zelda work as cleaners for a government research facility ignored,0.5765029
and invisible they are given little praise for their work described merely as piss wipers,0.40318432
well that's not very motivating,0.09680463
she are not exactly closeted gay friend Giles live in the shadows of society in a small set of apartments over a movie theater Giles too suffers from being outcast by society due to being a gay man we're in the 60s this was usually kept as a secret and Giles loses his job as an advertisement artist after an incident most likely involving him being open about being gay just like ELISA Giles in his own way is mistreated entirely because of who he is and that not fitting the era's ideologies elisa's life is pretty routine at first until a new asset is brought to the facility,0.030539338
she works at by Colonel Strickland this all-american hero is at the top of the heap and this eras great America and at the time things truly were great for people like him,0.24106535
he's white married quotes Bible,0.31089434
verses missive Lita Zelda questioning why she has no siblings like most of her people and he's the kind of guy that when told by a salesman four out of five successful men drive a Cadillac he buys one on the spot,0.19558424
because of course he's one of those successes himself,0.18797307
at least in his own mind the white privilege constantly afforded to him leads him to believe he is the hero of his own story,0.40088242
and this is kind of a flip of a typical hero of the classic,0.13259837
monster movies the square-jawed hero is supposed to be the romantic adventurer but Strickland personifies this only to himself and is in fact the film's antagonist he's returned from South America with a creature a thing as he refers to it an aquatic monster who is worshipped as a God by the locals and no this is not a spin-off of Hellboy,0.36426866
even though the amphibian man and ape sapien are both betrayed by longtime del Toro collaborator Doug Jones with the creature,0.24002181
now captive Strickland exhibits his feelings of superiority over it treating it hostile II rather than attempting to understand it prodding it with his electric baton as the creature is a primal being it reacts aggressively to Strickland's behavior biting off two of his fingers,0.26349828
but if the creature is treated with compassion,0.13669048
a different more sympathetic side emerges which we see in its interactions with ELISA,0.15163967
when she has a chance encounter with the creature,0.16672255
unlike Strickland she treats it with wonder and interest and after more encounters the to develop a friendship even romantic feelings with ELISA teaching,0.098174416
it sign language as the creature also has no voice like herself granting,0.24149244
the two the ability to communicate,0.11879739
so we see there is much more to the amphibian man beyond being a deadly monster,0.46643704
but of course to Strickland it is nothing more than a thing a curiosity,0.13887991
and it's decided to kill the creature and perform an autopsy on him to learn what they can when ELISA learns of this,0.55694884
she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to break the creature out of the facility keeping him in a bathtub at her apartment in disbelief in losing the asset and under increasing scrutiny from his superiors Strickland launches an investigation into the escape questioning all of the employees at the facility when Excel de an√°lisis turned to be interviewed Strickland dismisses them as possible subjects how could these two possibly pull off a heist like that,0.13084388
and instead pins his suspicions on the Russians being responsible knowing he will eventually track them down,0.18986255
Alisa finds a way to set the amphibian man free once and for all using a canal that feeds directly into the ocean but they have to wait until the specific day,0.17505907
the rainfall is high enough for it to work so Giles and ELISA keep the amphibian man in hiding in the mean time,0.12089122
and Giles comes around to accepting the creature after some initial reluctance and we see with Giles that there is another power at its disposal,0.11730085
the ability to heal in this case after touching,0.104667135
Giles is bald head,0.497491
the creature begins to glow blue and veins all over its body,0.1955592
and later Giles finds he has new hair growth on his once bald head,0.4082666
this is our first example of the creatures healing abilities as well as showing us that concept of understanding once again to the creature even as a gay man Charles is worthy just like everyone else is worthy of acceptance and he did help him escape as well as forgiving him for eating,0.5154597
one of his cats,0.11013151
so yeah he's a good guy,0.09466964
then the fateful day arrives with the rain pouring heavily as they gather at the canal,0.14064091
but before they can set him free a crazed Strickland arrives furiously shooting the creature,0.5876557
and Alisa full of bullet holes the creature is motionless and for a moment it appears that Strickland got what he wanted in the end,0.18434192
but then the creatures skin starts to glow brightly once again this time healing his wounds and reviving him and Strickland realizes a little too late the creature is indeed a god getting his throat slit by its cloth,0.2415092
well there you go buddy,0.079327874
that's what you get for being closed-minded and thinking you're right all the time he constantly undercut,0.19314986
everyone unlike him and never believed them to be his equals,0.18376033
and it's his antiquated privileged mentality that got him killed however it looks like Alisa is gone mortally wounded by the gunshots the creature then scoops her up diving into the water the two float together and the creature kisses her as he glows causing Elise's next stars to form into gills filling with breath under the water then after being healed is now an underwater breathing creature,0.22433329
just like the amphibian man the scars that once made her different have now been turned into life-giving gills what held her back before is now what can tweets her inner new form,0.09293548
now the two can finally be together having someone that understands them and accepts them for who they are no matter who they are if a mute woman or a see God as Deltora himself said do not reduce a person to one word see the other person listen because the antidote to hatred is understanding again in antithesis to the classic Universal monster films where their only destiny was to die the shape of water shows us that sometimes even monsters are worthy of love and acceptance well that'll wrap it up for my look at the shape of water,0.2585718
sorry if I got a little political or anything,0.085150965
they're not trying to make a grand statement about society or anything,0.06939957
but merely exploring the themes behind the film as presented,0.04404018
what did you guys think of the shape of water,0.067585826
