named Cleo living in Mexico during the 70s and she works for this family and,0.020516925
she eventually has to look after this family because the family is falling apart but,0.04009594
Cleo herself she's dealing with her own stuff as well and the movie mainly focuses,0.042665545
on Cleo and her life like she is the heart of the story the movie,0.050735552
does focus on the family itself but it mainly focuses on Cleo and her life,0.030396897

during that time there are so many layers to unpack in this film and in,0.027458781
this film you can tell that Alfonso is honoring this woman clear in his life,0.17532977
she obviously had a big part in his life she obviously helped shape him into,0.07744201
who he is today and I think Alfonso captured this film beautifully he captured it,0.04318572
in such an elegant way Fonzo is basically telling the story of clear and with,0.010538504
all of the family stuff going on he tells that through the perspective of clear,0.01884931
and it's beautifully executed and as I said before Cleary is essentially the heart of,0.15995471
the film and the actress who plays Cleo I don't know how to pronounce a,0.04052432
name I'm so sorry but she is fantastic here she delivers a very graceful and,0.042301025
very subtle performance that resonates throughout like it's so powerful and it's her first acting,0.03944273

so many heartbreaking scenes in this film as well there are two scenes that immediately,0.04209881
come to mind one of them is a beach scene and the other one is,0.042255793
a shopping scene and those scenes they nearly made me cry and this movie it,0.06208292

most gorgeous looking films of 2018 it was shot in 65 millimeter black-and-white and that,0.01563381
adds a bit more of that authenticity to the story and Alfonso Curran he carries,0.056491386
and he holds onto these really long tanks of such care and emotion and he,0.029651226
does that he tracks and pans the characters he follows these characters along in frame,0.025672764

smaller moment in a film have a bigger purpose by adding smaller details in those,0.012668422
moments like the sounds on the sound design in this film is some of the,0.023906035
best sound design I've heard all year it fully immerses you into this experience in,0.02674637
such a sophisticated way so I don't like to say that a film is a,0.032919273
masterpiece straight away like there have been a couple films this year where I've had,0.17262647
to think about it and over time I'd consider those films to be masterpieces but,0.04244537
Romar like right after watching Roma I would actually consider it to be a masterpiece,0.031040795
a beautiful masterpiece and Roma is probably not just my favorite film this year but,0.021957047
probably in the past couple of years like I just fell in love this film,0.05772863

hope that Roma gets a bunch of Oscar nominations like Best Picture Best Director Best,0.019684114
writer Best Actress Best Cinematography best sound editing best sound mixing and just so on,0.03262859
and so on but I am a bit worried that the Academy they won't really,0.02397322
consider Roma because it's technically being released on Netflix and I feel like Netflix will,0.018027142
get in the way of that but only time will tell and Roma is a,0.013404116
foreign film so it might fall under the foreign feature film category but still I,0.025306912
want Roma to win a bunch of awards okey-dokey guacamole let me know what you,0.065290436
