this movie started up so well and crashed and burned right in front of my face,0.5539314
oh goodness,0.07555296
so first offer after bad anyone who tells you that this movie was amazing was great um they're lying to you,0.35175306
I was expecting this wouldn't be good,0.13717018
and it wasn't this is probably one of the worst Marvel Studios films that I've seen I would probably give that award to to Thor Ragnarok but the redeeming Grace about,0.16418245
Thor Ragnarok is that you know add,0.07079412
the millions of jokes they had on display there were actually a couple that were funding that I kind of giggled that this however has all the bad of thor ragnarok but without the humor there's the I mean there's like bits and pieces of humor where they tried but it was just like no it was a Miss,0.10058136
so let's get into it that the movie starts off amazing,0.089992546
they tell the history of of will condign how the Black Panther came to be and all the five tribes and everything I'm just like yo this this is it was amazingly done,0.22775185
I was like you know they managed to wrap all that up in about a few seconds,0.110897444
I was like this movies about to be good Marvel Studios comes on,0.11760108
so the movie starts off right,0.06850423
it kind of like in the middle of of Civil War where he hid where his father dies and now he becomes king starts off with this scene the process of process of how he becomes king and it's very much kind of like how it's done in the jungle with the lines where you know if he had the headline and if no one challenges the headline,0.08121714
well he remains the headline,0.05433816
if someone challenges him and you know and he went,0.06992521
well this guy's a new the new headline,0.1496591
the head of the head of the head of the the tribe or if he concedes well then he remains the headline,0.18771535
it's usually to the death based off the you know the Discovery Channel,0.31245995
so what happens is they ask all the tribes,0.09803922
Bhiwandi,0.1117395
you know do,0.06833995
we have a challenger to chawla everyone concedes,0.09434418
no we don't have a challenge,0.093363956
no we don't have a challenger,0.1889846
and one the other when the other tribes are the mountain they have a challenger so they fight it out and T'Challa ends up winning just by an inch by inch he wins and he becomes king,0.119654454
now when it comes to the costume,0.07524499
I know I was bitching and moaning about the costume and you know what it after seen the movie I don't have a problem with the new costume,0.5410993
and the reason why is because we barely see it,0.09161912
there is a problem with Marvel films,0.14211315
and this was most pertinent in the spider-man series is where they have every five seconds they have to remove the super ass remove his mask I'm like yo,0.794439
I didn't come here to see the actor I came here to see Black Panther every five seconds you know his he's taking off his mask whether it's digital or he's constantly removing it,0.31816274
so when it comes to the action in this movie you would think for a movie titled Black Panther,0.31315053
we would see more of the black panther in action um sadly we do not,0.1260638
I think there's like maybe four for action pieces,0.0702469
the first part is the one where he's in the jungle that was horribly filmed,0.15754874
I understand that it's black and that his suit is black so that makes it hard for bad people to see him but as an audience member that makes it hard for me to see him as well,0.49016473
so it's black on black on black literally and I'm like I don't know what's going on in the theater,0.55497986
I don't know what's what's happening on screen,0.111904204
I can't see anything one thing,0.077848025
I do like about the film is that you know,0.03352025
everyone is strong,0.04989742
everyone has a sense of pride in a sense of character like he goes in to save this girl that he likes which in the trailer,0.15724966
they said you know don't freeze,0.09404846
he of course freezes in front of her you know like his crush or whatever,0.39712408
but she you know as soon as she gets that second to escape captivity she does and she's paying on BAM like these women are trained as a matter of fact my favorite character throughout the entire movie wasn't even to chala,0.28774014
it has to be his his guard,0.12934865
the the bald headed woman who's like the protector like she is more dedicated to Wakanda than he is,0.55732197
and she's more of a strong and justjust a strong and powerful character like how she's I don't even say how she's written but how she's portrayed on screen how she does it,0.12863526
it's like help you do not want to mess with this woman I'd rather see her as Black Panther ten to Charla and I'm gonna tell you why as I go on in this review,0.578746
so the whole story arc of Black Panther is surrounds about Jordan P Jordan B's character in Jordan these characters,0.01432827
essentially two challahs father on his brother goes to America sleeps with a woman apparently the white woman because Jordan he's pretty light and has Jordan B's character the child's father comes comes to America and confronts him because you know Jordan B's father was selling vibranium and Jordan B's father his whole ideas you know we need to rise up,0.44865164
you know we need to supply all the blacks with weaponry that we have and we need to control the world,0.80216056
and then by our hand we give out justice,0.13237575
that's what he wants,0.08148622
he wants to control the world,0.14272165
so long story,0.059745535
short Andy's character makes his way back to Wakanda,0.08689649
I'm not sure how he makes his way back to Wakanda because who he was dependent upon on finding his way there um he kills and that was Andy Serkis character the claws he straight kills him before he even gets the directions to Wakanda whatever will bypass that she Jordan B comes back to a condom with Andy Serkis his character the claw,0.67987293
I'm dead he lays it at the the doorsteps of Wakanda,0.31089434
so the big thing about Andy Serkis is character claw is that T'Challa was supposed to be going to America to get Claude to bring him back in order to serve justice,0.1032687
it's in order for his trial to be had and you know he promises,0.117209055
one of the other members of the tribe who Klaw killed he killed I think of is his family his mother father or something like that he's like yo are you gonna bring him back because every one every black panther including you is said they're gonna do something,0.68617374
they have it and to tell us like I got you I got you I'm gonna bring him back and he's gonna serve you,0.24362871
no justice,0.12809484
I promise you that he comes up in D empty-handed right he comes back,0.29851487
sorry,0.041893564
he slipped through my hands um which is why it makes it,0.10649207
so important that Jordan be he ends up killing him and brings him back to a kind of like you know,0.69542736
I brought him back,0.071320705
your King can do it,0.15071341
I did she draw in B's characters like I want the throne and I want to fight you in order to get the throne because that's how it's done and you know touch Allah accepts thing is apparently,0.18486726
you can challenge,0.066621624
the king at any point in time regardless of when they're having the tournament or not but whatever that's neither here or there,0.0479511
so they get to fighting right,0.1333111
and in Jordan B's character he wins,0.05487151
now listen to me,0.07273288
he wins,0.11884471
he ends up killing T'Challa,0.684044
he's them picks him up and throws him off,0.2726753
he went,0.06875608
he's rightfully the king everyone's devastated,0.13611725
all,0.036047194
oh my god,0.059858862
he's the king I can't believe this,0.11772175
we've got to do something about we got to do something about this,0.07480107
and I'm like wait what do you,0.09266081
what do you mean you have to do something about this by your own rules that you have in place,0.15134576
he rightfully won I'd understand a few was he did something fair,0.093210004
he be had the you know Black Panthers power prior to the fight um but no he fair and square one,0.4033801
so I don't so bake they're completely about to undermine everything old Black Panthers history the culture the heritage all that undermine it all because they don't like who rightfully is in power not only that but Jordan B,0.3593939
you said you know that the flour that they take it in order to become to get the powers of the Black Panther Jordan be is like he'll burn it burn it all and she's like look,0.5154597
we can't do that he's like you know,0.15470512
don't you ever holes are up bad throws like don't you ever,0.40124863
tell me what I can and can't do I'm King you burn it all,0.6046689
so they burn it all and I'm thinking to myself you want to tell me the most advanced country on the face of the planet has no contingency within their constitution in regards to stopping or thwarting a dictatorship,0.5876557
that's what you want to tell me,0.067470506
ok,0.03639615
then I start thinking about it,0.07724721
I'm like hold up all the kings and power all they've managed to demonstrate that they they have a physical ability of physical superiority over everyone else,0.28641742
that's it that's all you that's all it is you have to do,0.090907976
nor they continue to become a super hero is orange is the the fight,0.14045799
that's it,0.05140533
there's no you know tests of mine,0.0868144
no wisdom none of that just you just have to you just have to be physically more domineering than everyone else,0.35045034
I'm like yo,0.08962121
that's this Point Blank game stupid,0.8606264
and the reason why it's stupid is case in point Gordon B's character so moving on the mountain tribe defines a two challahs body and they have them in preservation the family you know chitara and the sister and everything and his girlfriend all leave and go to the tribe go to the mountain king and they they offer him,0.56772983
they offer him the the powers of the Black Panther,0.122536026
so they are really just crapping on everything that what Wakanda in the Black Panther stands for they're about to offer,0.5154597
a rival tribe of the powerful Black Panther,0.085890286
so the dude is like yo come here,0.14401557
let me show you like here's here's your king here's the child,0.1949925
this is who he is so they give to child the the the medicine of the super powers of the Black Panther,0.26445225
and he wakes up and everything he's like yo okay Simon settle things I'm like hold up hold up here,0.10311349
you can't give him the medicine of the Black Panther because he lost technically by law,0.24041267
he should be dead,0.8606264
that's that's it,0.05304675
so this whole idea about what Condor forever,0.08686652
we understand from akanda,0.09438781
it's all bull crap because you don't care about what Conda or the laws that they have in place or the culture,0.7765521
because you don't like it that the man that you wanted to win,0.28758615
when the win the fight and all that is now dethroned is now essentially dead so you guys are willing to to bypass everything history history of your people in order to put this man to chala back in power and T'Challa isn't really that big of a king,0.25342694
he's not even he's a weak King in my opinion they managed to cut to China because throughout the history throughout the film they're battling with this,0.28765094
this idea of you know I move a condo or more advanced,0.07815802
we should be able to help people of other countries help our people who are in the country,0.10887781
and we're 2 tallis like y'all know that's that's not our job that's our responsibility i am king of two,0.113368064
I'm king of Wakanda,0.101882935
and my job is for the wakandan people I have no problem,0.1528452
I get that he's absolutely right,0.10502854
but even if he did want to help other people war or less privileged than him,0.14920732
then he you know there's other means to do it you just don't cuz in the movie in the movie I know I'm jumping ahead,0.07599446
so so going back to where I was T'Challa comes back and join me Peterson,0.13051797
he's like yo did the fight,0.24228121
all of that determining who's King that's all over to tell us I go,0.1047479
I'm still alive and I didn't concede,0.12355284
I didn't concede,0.04672008
so the battle so long so they did the Queen that not the Queen the the the warrior later she's like yo did the fight is still on technically by the law of the land by our law,0.08836829
the fight is along Jordan B's character looks to the dude,0.10416797
remember the the tribe guy who got his parents killed by cloth,0.5557665
he looks at him as like yo kill T'Challa the Duke goes and does it,0.7093121
I'm like there's nobody care about the law or what Conda in the Black Panther tribe like oh this is just like just a free-for-all all it takes is one person,0.26134288
I'm just like this is crazy,0.35300002
this is Magnus because technically the fight should still be on they should have their fight,0.15916717
and make it happen this do goes off and starts fighting uh T'Challa and their tribe,0.21319367
so there's absolute craziness on-screen,0.30309463
so because you had this whole tribe trying to fight a T'Challa and to Charles defending and trying to stop the ships from going out because Jordan B is like yo sind send the weaponry through Vance wedding ring to these people we have spies in every country send them out,0.16997164
and let's get this revolution started and to child's like no you can't have that,0.18836577
so he's trying to stop them,0.15416151
while fighting the tribe and all of this and then I'm just like then they have I kid you not they bring out CGI rhinos and they have rhinos attacking their own people,0.4181448
so I'm like yo did the director - the scriptwriter do they not think this through they had black people attacking black people I'm like even OMA conduct this black-on-black crime come on so the fight slows down and - child's sister starts fighting torn beasts character in the child sister and as his love interest and Jordan B is in the middle of about to kill -,0.6364068
child sister T'Challa,0.46320105
that's when he jumps,0.064932294
he's like no and he stops him and then we we are we are just words can't describe just that the the weakness of this film it is,0.11134373
so all the hype that was put behind this film this climax scene between Jordan B's character and T'Challa,0.071084514
it's just that it was so just just we cuckoo came up with this,0.30275077
this is this fight scene was garbage,0.7093121
I was severely upset watching this fight scene,0.31089434
so wrapping this all up Jordan be a character ends up dying,0.33093643
how I have no idea cuz the last time I checked the Black Panther potion tears you of any of any harm or any bruises or scars or wounds it cures you,0.15886971
so I'm like you have superpowers,0.11577161
so I'm not sure how he dies whatever they let him die,0.77920306
we wrapping this up,0.07972574
we're wrapping this up and T'Challa comes out,0.15746951
he goes to the UN,0.062699474
he's like yo we're here,0.10654528
we're gonna help basically he's talking about build bridges not walls all this whoopty whoop all this crap I'm like hold up no no no no no no No,0.794439
you want to tell me because his girl his his love in trees is like kill makanda is fall enough to protect ourselves and help others I'm like obviously the hell you aren't you had one person drawing,0.76810634
these character one guy completely undermine everything completely,0.18933076
oh just turn your whole country upside down on its head one person you want to tell me that a country that the entire nation finds out that Africa has this vibranium most one the most powerful and you know allies resources of the world don't the planet and then you're just gonna sit idly by and let what conduct hand it out,0.31089434
well you get this and we're gonna help you here,0.08917129
no of course not that's gonna start a war,0.31089434
so like the hell with Wakanda and all that and as I was saying about the child being a weak-ass leader,0.8606264
he is a weak-ass leader they they freaking cocked,0.91127646
I can't believe what I'm saying they come they manage to cook the Black Panther they manage to cut one,0.4913052
the strongest most Alpha characters in the Marvel Universe,0.07035279
they manage to cut this man,0.48743486
this dude was all about him and his people and making sure they survive,0.19235581
and they cut this dude because he's not even a strong enough character a he barely wins the first fight,0.23753746
the second fight,0.11049352
he dies he loses that fight,0.49386904
the only way even comes back if it was through the power of of them just completely crapping on the laws of the land,0.3744253
so I'm like I eat all of this,0.17037977
and then he goes,0.06331309
and just leaves open his people talking about bridges not walls to two possible attacks inevitable attacks this movie was garbage,0.7093121
just straight garbage,0.80067986
anyone who talks about this movie being great and everything you have no sense of taste,0.38601702
you have no respect for yourself,0.55924124
and you're just saying it because it's black panther anyways guys that's the video limit oh you guys see one that I you enjoy the film or not you thought it was garbage like I did um either or hope,0.6492958
you guys enjoyed the video,0.107822366
if you did please feel free to like share comment subscribe all that fun stuff till next time guys be amazing even OMA conduct this black-on-black crime come on,0.66755956
