the Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and Al,0.05743548
Pacino and follows the life of Frank Sheeran a truck driver who may or may,0.13678443
not have had some involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa I was really excited,0.08350212
for this movie purely and simply because it is directed by Martin Scorsese now I,0.07682421
don't have to explain myself on that one because the guy is a genius when,0.14964955
it comes to filmmaking and throughout his entire career he's never made at least in,0.15947475
my personal opinion he is yet to make a single bad film every movie he's,0.3052518
made has been good if not great and the best thing about his career is,0.14873256
that even though some of his movies may be structurally or stylistically a little bit,0.15362327
similar every movie he makes is pretty much completely different from the last for example,0.08148357
Hugo is completely different to silence the wolf of Wall Street is completely different to,0.11392797
Goodfellas and the Irishman is another one of those movies in his career it feels,0.10855762
very familiar yet has enough different things going on that it kind of stands as,0.023635002
its own unique thing that he is yet to pull off in his career and,0.10289944
I've got to say the Irishman is yet another great film to add to his,0.071582206
filmography because I enjoyed every single minute of this movie and that's saying something especially,0.093312085
considering how long dismay V is but I'll get onto that in a little bit,0.14819486
first up I have to talk about the performances everyone in this movie brings their,0.051465306
a game and that's saying something considering you have pretty much a shitload of a-listers,0.68001246
in this film you've got Robert De Niro playing Frank Sheeran and he's really really,0.15605882
good in this movie he does a lot he conveys a lot of emotion in,0.0957178
this movie just through his facial expression or the way he looks because usually nowadays,0.2813495
in film you're used to someone kind of telling you how they feel whereas in,0.13807584
this movie there's a lot of just distant or blank expressions that are left open,0.06999782
for interpretation in terms of how he is feeling and there are a lotta scenes,0.06676782
where you're just solely relying on the look that Robert De Niro is giving on,0.080668435
his face to pretty much explain how he is feeling in said scenes and I,0.23719765
think it works really well here that and also the fact that any scene that,0.05083636
he is in with Joe Pesci who plays Russell is absolutely brilliant and it's really,0.10104293
nice to see Joe Pesci in a movie like this again because he is /,0.19678308
as far as I'm aware he came out of retirement just to be in this,0.059963174
movie and I haven't seen him in a film since well Homeline - all the,0.056965295
good old Goodfellas and it's really nice to see him doing what he does best,0.14536494
again because I've kind of missed him being in films but no Joe Pesci brings,0.15060449
his a-game to this film and he really is so good in this movie that,0.16887742
he's one of those characters where if you're on his good side you he's a,0.095883965
really likable character but then if you get just ever so slightly on his bad,0.15484937
side he could completely your life up and that switch between the two is really,0.11416893
noticeable in this movie and I loved everything he did with that performance Al Pacino,0.12730944
is also really great in this movie as he plays Jimmy Hoffa and I thought,0.055869564
he was fantastic in almost every single scene he was in and I'm quite surprised,0.089429654
to find out that this is his first collaboration with Scorsese you would think over,0.09624566
the many years both of them have been working you would have thought at some,0.0640254
point they would have worked together but apparently this is the first time they have,0.05667791
worked on a project together and it shows because they really do work so well,0.06344476
together when put in the right project and Al Pacino makes every moment last in,0.0574783
this film especially the moments where he's able to kind of go full-on and really,0.09430489
over exaggerate certain things and just go really over-the-top in his performance and I love,0.057773646
it when he does that in movies if you've seen heat you'll know exactly what,0.06260674
I'm on about she got great ass and you got your hair all the way,0.88932383
up but yeah he was fantastic in this movie and also a lot of the,0.08575899
supporting cast were great as well and as an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's projects,0.10858705
throughout the years it's really nice to see a lot of actors from his TV,0.0779156
oriented projects such as Broadwalk Empire or vinyl it's nice to see a lot of,0.09018523
those actors crop up in this movie such as Ray Romano Bobby Cannavale and of,0.15781586
course Steven Graham Steven Graham is one of the most underrated actors working today I'm,0.070127904
just saying every performance I see of him is like better than the last one,0.10194824
I'm not saying something considering that every performance he gives is absolutely fantastic but yeah,0.07904815
he really does deliver in this movie and everyone delivers I suppose my only nitpick,0.14888017
when it comes to performances or screen time in that sense is the Anna Paquin,0.077667624
who plays an older version of Robert Nero's daughter doesn't get that much screen time,0.064880826
and I wouldn't really care that much if it wasn't such an integral arc in,0.056837372
the emotional personality of Robert De Niro's character is such an important emotional arc for,0.036049042
his character yet you don't really see much of her character therefore that arc kind,0.12551382
of feels a little bit a little bit empty in my opinion I do think,0.40312922
the point of it is conveyed by the end of the film but I just,0.047124688
would have liked one or two more scenes with her character just to fully to,0.056822143
make that arc fully realized in its best form oh and in regards to the,0.0676166
de-aging stuff that they do for the actors yeah it's a little bit noticeable at,0.1165537
first but after a couple of things you just kind of get used to it,0.09219515
and it's actually really bloody impressive there's a lot of shots where Joe Pesci looks,0.40311852
like a young Joe Pesci or De Niro looks like really De Niro and it's,0.14650308
just really impressive especially with some of the scenes and how they play out and,0.057586204
how technically intricate they are especially in regards to how well they're shot the fact,0.13631654
that they're able to make that D aging thing look as convincing as it is,0.06254946
amongst these intricate looking like long takes is really impressive now the one thing that,0.05087918
people are talking about the most about this movie is the runtime is three and,0.09016216
a half hours long and yes that can seem very daunting at first but I've,0.09972189
got to be honest even though there are times in the film where you can,0.06585567
kind of feel that three hour runtime kick in I was thoroughly fascinated and engaged,0.2188086
throughout the entire thing and that's also even more saying something considering that a lot,0.04684384
of the movie is just people talking yes you do have scenes of violence and,0.25768954
you know some really tense scenes especially towards the end but the majority of the,0.07811744
movie is just people sitting down and talking to each other or just a lot,0.15190072
of montages explaining how certain things got from point A to point B and it's,0.05713001
pretty much Scorsese doing what he did in Goodfellas but a lot more refined and,0.113298476
restrained to the point where it feels more polished than Goodfellas in a sense if,0.08792124
you've seen the movie you kind of know I mean but it kind of feels,0.19763736
a lot more you know focused and restrained than Goodfellas water was and I really,0.068263166
did appreciate that about this movie which kept me engaged throughout it's three and a,0.06343572
half hour long runtime also is entertaining as the Mafia related stuff is in this,0.114185266
movie I actually found one of the more interesting and more powerful moments to come,0.046915162
actually right at the end of the movie when you see Frank as an old,0.12120455
man I don't say anything else if you haven't seen the film but I just,0.06233334
thought it really really worked for me and the emotional resonance of that scene specifically,0.06845981
the one of the last shots of the film really hits home and kind of,0.0830037
ends up delivering a completely different theme and message then maybe what was conveyed at,0.044458274
the start of the movie because at the start of the film you kind of,0.09530037
think okay I'm kind of going into my regular Scorsese cliches here but then by,0.1470042
the end of the film school says he delivers you a completely new message and,0.064703435
it really does hit if you know exactly what you're looking for in the end,0.11591682
the Irishman is a thoroughly entertaining movie that can feel a tad slow at times,0.15472357
but never completely drags the movie down because of it but no it is a,0.049709544
thoroughly entertaining movie with fantastic performances I suppose if I had to nitpick in the,0.109701924
movie I would say that the passage of time in certain bits towards the start,0.080571696
of the film is a little unclear because you're kind it will kind of cut,0.122724034
from one scene to another and you're not sure whether you're still in the same,0.07662032
time period or whether they've jumped forwards or backwards in time it gets a little,0.10867027
bit clearer the more the movie goes on to come because it kind of sticks,0.17136496
in a certain time period of Frank's life for a long period of time and,0.0723649
then will then cut to the next and then cut to the next but in,0.15213594
those first few scenes it's a little bit unclear because it just bounces back and,0.18521903
forth all the time and you're a little bit unsure how old he's supposed to,0.34697598
be or how far or how early in these people's lives we are currently in,0.12281132
because there's no indication of it and it just kind of feels a little unclear,0.08196132
at first but like I said it does get a lot clearer the more the,0.07484428
movie goes on and apart from that though I will happily give the Irishman an,0.09025623
8.5 out of 10 this is definitely proof that Scorsese still knows what he's doing,0.09467001
and he's just a master of his craft at this point he's yet to make,0.1107614
a bad movie and the Irishman is proof that he can still make fantastic films,0.24235731
so guys that was my review for the Irishman I hope you enjoyed it if,0.1782891
