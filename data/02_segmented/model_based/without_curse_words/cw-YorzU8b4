"Well, this movie opens up a lot of possibilities for Sony and Spider-man Spider-man into the Spider-verse So into the Spider Verse is a Spider-man animated adventure with Miles Morales, Spider-man It's actually an origin story of Miles Morales"
"Spider-man Always, He's been doing this for years, Peter Parker"
Spider-man's in this movie
"He has been doing this for years, but they come together and something happens and the Spider Verse gets fractured and other Spider-man's get brought into the adventure and Spider people, Spider-gwen and a spider cartoon Pigs, and I'll bring on the adventure"
It's a really fun adventure too
It's not just fun
"I mean, fun is in here, but it has heart"
You get invested
You're really gonna attach to Miles Morales
You see that he's at this yuppie school
It's just kind of a fish out of water
"He's really feel for the dude, so I feel like if you're a Miles Morales fan going into this movie, you're really gonna feel like the movie did him justice"
"If you're not a Miles Morales fan, This will bring you over to the Miles Morales side of things"
"He's a legit, Spider-man Really likable dude, But the movie was hilarious"
It was funny as hell to the war Spider-man was hysterical having on the floor
"Funny When I was driving home, I was comparing this to the Raimi Spider-man movie and the Raimi Spider-man Even the Amazing Spider-man He doesn't actually get the Spider-man suit"
He doesn't become Spider-man till about an hour into the movie
This movie is longer
He doesn't actually get his stride until the end
"Most of the movie is him learning about it, getting a handle on it"
Like the Raimi Spider-man skipped over that part
He's like I have these powers
Uncle Ben died
"Then it zooms into the artwork, and then now he's been Spider-man for a while"
"This with Miles Morales, not Peter Parker"
"Is that? In between, it's the growing pains"
It's him learning
It's him trying to figure it out and being mentored by Peter Parker
"When I saw the trailer, I was like Peter Parker"
Kind of looks like a slob who doesn't care
I don't know if I like that
There is a story-based reason for it
It actually works really well for those movies
The animation stylin
here's a funny thing
because it is stylistic
It's pretty slick
"For the most part, It absolutely does work for the type of action based animation they want to show here"
"On the other hand, though the animation smooth is, but, or sometimes, some other times it looks like the animation drops frame rate"
I imagine it's purposely done
not accidental
Like when you're streaming something and it drops frame right
It goes from smooth and when people are interacting it looks like they're almost in the stop-motion animation type of frame rate
You get used to it
"The animation does work for the story, but they're trying to do"
"is it make a comic book come to life? Essentially this animation style does work for that, and after that you slip into it"
"you really appreciate what the animation does for the action sequences That click frame animation lend itself to action being very fast, so it makes for very exciting Spider-man action when it's going down, so in the end it really does work"
Any negatives I have is like they're just gripes
Really their nitpick
It runs into
essentially what the Raimi Spider-man movies run into
her
"At least Spider-man 2, because that was the one with the villain who was essentially a normal dude Like Doc Ock"
"has tentacles, But he's a normal guy"
He's not super power
"So when Spiderman punches him in the face, I feel like you should be out"
There was actually one joke again
I'm gonna say nitpicks
There was one joke in here that had to do with the pig
"That kind of, I feel like it broke the fourth wall, like - a Deadpool degree, And I don't know if the pig is supposed to be like that, but it was said by someone else, Not the pig"
but I did feel like leave them out of humor
"- Deadpool and let's do Spider-man stuff here again, I said nitpicks, but something just stood out to me because in the end, Spider-man into the Spider Verse was a very fulfilling Spider-man origin story"
It's a word I had when I walked out of it
I was like it was very fulfilling
It's a great coming-of-age story
It's a great superhero origin story
"It's a Spider Man origin story You haven't seen on the big screen a hundred times, or at least twice"
It has heart
It's exciting
I like Miles Morales
I like the supporting cast
"All the voice acting was great, which is plenty more"
"Hershel Alley plays Miles Morales is Uncle in this movie, which is the same character Donald Glover played in Spider-man Homecoming, Very irrelevant for this review"
But I think it's cool Miles Morales
You are cool
"You have solidified yourself as a legit Spider-man In my eyes, Sorry, I'm a little late to that party"
"Not only did I like Miles Morales, but I liked his relationship with Peter Parker"
Or at least this universe is Peter Parker
It was
It was a really good story
but I will say Spider-man into the Spider Verse is definitely worth watching
Definitely worth buying on Blu-ray
I am curious as to the possibilities this opens up for Sonia
"Really Am, there are some Spider-man's stories I would totally love to see on screen in the vein of this animation like right now, I'm currently reading Superior Spider-man I'm in the second trade"
"I'm not too far, but I'm really digging it"
Superior Spider-man's when Doctor Octopus's consciousness has swapped with Peter Parker
"So it's Doc Ock's mind in Peter Parker's body, and he's like I can be a way more efficient spider-man than he was"
I'm not gonna waste it like him
I'm gonna be a superior spider-man That was reading it just last week
"I was thinking I was like we will never see this story on the big screen, but after this I, maybe that'd be really cool"
See a superior Spider-man story in the vein of this animation or an original spider
My story
I'm just saying this is the Goldilocks zone for Sony
You don't have to compete with the Mcu Do your own thing
This is totally their own
You knocked it out of the park
"All right, So Spider-man into the Spider-verse Have you seen it? What did you think about it? Whatever you thought, Comment below, let me know"
