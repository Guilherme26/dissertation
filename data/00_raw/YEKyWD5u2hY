[Music] if you're walking into book-smart expecting something exceedingly fresh on a narrative level then you may well walk out just slightly disappointed personally however I did not walk in desiring that or even needing that from American Graffiti too dazed and confused to The Breakfast Club to Ferris Bueller's Day Off to super bad I have no problem revisiting this now what I would call archetypal story from a slightly different perspective over and over and over again after all when it comes to things that we as humans share there is something incredibly unifying about the rite of passage that we experience when we move from our parents house out into the big bad world from high school onto the next chapter of our lives from childhood into adulthood and it's just kind of fun to relive and just revisit an experience through cinema and so again just looking at the narrative beats of book-smart we do indeed see director Olivia Wilde and screenwriters Susannah Fogle and Willie Halpern Sarah Hoskins and Kate Cyberman intentionally seeking to reproduce many familiar ones those end of high school Hail Mary parties those desperate unfulfilled longings for that special someone longings that must be fulfilled tonight or the world will end those bestfriend relationships that are about to be put to the test as those in them realized that they're about to change forever and of course those heartwarming character arcs and newfound levels of maturity but what made all of these now classic moments work so well and book-smart didn't just come from the screenwriters ability to craft them well on the page it also came from a really wonderful group of actors when I think back on my favorite films in this genre that has always absolutely been an essential ingredient for them again films like American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused those films would not have been half as memorable as they were without brilliant actors like Richard Dreyfuss and Matthew McConaughey and can you even imagine the film like Ferris Bueller's Day Off with an actor not quite as charismatic as Matthew Broderick and the same can absolutely be said for something like Superbad as well and if you did find yourself liking and laughing at and identify with either Michael Cera or Jonah Hill and that film in book-smart you'll more than likely adore benny Feldstein who's actually Jonah Hill's little sister and Katelyn Deaver speaking of the performances and yes I do realize that I do find myself repeating the same sentiment every single time that I see a film from an actor turned director but every single time that I do it's just so clear that the person behind the camera the person in charge of guiding those performances has so clearly been in an actor's shoes before and here it was indeed very clear that Olivia Wilde in her new role was able to pull from so many of her own experiences as an actress to help guide her performers in this film to uniquely excellent places but it wasn't just that she got good performances out of them I thought she also quite expertly threaded the very difficult stylistic and tonal needle coaching out of her actors performances that in certain moments felt very authentic and very real and another is appropriately heightened and just fun but now I actually saved my very highest praise for this film for last looking at something like Superbad I really watched that film and think wow what a phenomenally directed film what an impressive piece of cinema where the director really showed a mastery over the medium ensuring that he was using the camera the lighting the color and the music to always immerse me in the film and to be fair I shouldn't just pick on Superbad either really when it comes to all of the kind of Judd Apatow comedies very rarely did they do anything that heightened in the directorial department they're rather cut and dry meat potatoes they just rely on the comedy found in the script and in the actors performances to really draw us in and keep us engaged throughout the film but not so with book-smart and Olivia Wilde's direction this first-time feature film director was absolutely on fire so clearly out to demonstrate her brilliance as a visual storyteller in this new position and she did so and did so beautifully there were so many sequences in this film that were appropriately as heightened and as fun and as colorful as a brilliant music video just sucking me once more into the excitement and heightened importance of something like the last day of school which is exactly how I as a high schooler viewed such things just that much intention and creativity was fantastic to see in a genre that so often overlooks it so even while book-smart didn't ultimately break that much new ground from a narrative standpoint olivia wilde as a director was still able to breathe so much fun fresh and engaging life into it with some excellent direction all this to say i will definitely be keeping my eyes on this director as your career progresses and for all these reasons I will give the film a 4 out 5 and a heart I would still love know what you guys thought of the film though sadef like comment
