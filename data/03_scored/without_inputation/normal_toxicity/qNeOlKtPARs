the story comes the movies biggest flaw also you see as the story's going along,0.10376689
and you're seeing more of this world that Pixar has created at a point it,0.12624148
feels like that becomes the point that pic stars trying to get across like it,0.0994298
felt like Pixar what's going hey look what we can do we can make all,0.11197179
sorts of cool stuff that shouldn't really be the point of a movie the point,0.106985174
of a movie should be to tell a good story but the movie did have,0.056859016
a really good story so I'd say it feels like half and half at the,0.06005098
time it felt like they were showing this big world just for the sake of,0.07655042
doing it and the other half of the time it felt like it was more,0.05818949
focused on the story and don't get me wrong I like seeing this big world,0.107560076
that Pixar has brought to us they've never failed at that they've never disappointed us,0.090841055

good as a story of this movie is it is also a tat predictable which,0.08417321
was very shocking to me because I don't remember Pixar movies being predictable at all,0.085849226
but when I think back to all the great Pixar movies we've gotten they do,0.102735125
follow a pretty basic formula there's always that one point I think back to the,0.056020442
first toy story where Woody and Buzz are on the street and they're trying to,0.06353497
catch up to the moving van and woody gets out the match to light the,0.0673827
rocket and the car drives by and blows out the match hope just doesn't seem,0.14797606
lost hope is lost there is just absolutely no hope for these characters that we,0.093748756
have grown to love over the course of an hour and a half they've lost,0.14692867
and then by some glimmer of hope they actually managed to pull through the situation,0.06590366
and it's a happy ending I'm just saying the pics are formulas getting kind of,0.09149873
tired they're still pulling it off very well but I think next time they should,0.15114665
