- Dom BIA and stars Lisa I appreciate and marina de terraria and it starts,0.076039135
with a family and a housekeeper set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood in 1970 Mexico,0.016546443
City I'm going to talk about it right now so Roma is a ambitious movie,0.04889499
which is a black-and-white film directed by Alfonso Curran and the film is a very,0.00016900428
slow pacing movie which takes you through the lives of family and the housekeeper for,0.10903491
about two years and one thing about this channel I'm going to do I'm not,0.060358763
going to involved spoilers in the beginning I will talk about some spoilers toward the,0.05709537
end but there will be a warning at the bottom but for now talk about,0.07109616
the movie itself and overall the movie is a slow burn it is all black,0.41316804
and white pan and scan and one shot takes so what you'll see is a,0.15475298
film where there would be a scene that goes on for maybe three to four,0.059498016
minutes and it's all one take and the camera will pan left to right slowly,0.056389615
and then back again and it's a very very unsettling approach because you're feeling like,0.019125361
you're a voyeur and it's like there's no tilt with the camera it's all pan,0.10265048
and scan mainly and the shots that are stable are tend to be behind things,0.052932654
or back off from the subject and you don't really quite see reactions and the,0.023320008
thing about the film is interesting is it's a very artsy film and you wonder,0.020269476
what this thing is going because it just deals with these people you kind of,0.042003687
have to really follow along it's in Spanish so you could have to read the,0.022936197
subtitles but of course when you do that after a while it becomes second nature,0.021273904
okay in the category of story or depth this movie doesn't really have a lot,0.03346539
of that is it's a lot of it cerebral and and a one out of,0.18512326
ten I had to give this movie a five in that regard because it's just,0.05407677
averaged it's a character development story with no clear plot direction it's just a life,0.035754953
of these people as it is over the course of a couple of years in,0.037113257
a category of emotional impact now this is probably where the movie is at the,0.013323628
strongest it's because without giving anything away through the first two acts of the movie,0.034351412
you're basically following this housekeeper mainly through her eyes and the family of the people,0.10064295
that she is attending and they get involved in things along the way that are,0.025612896
traumatic and you end up really feeling for these characters and identifying with these characters,0.024030425
so by the end of the third act when things start going crazy you start,0.11949692
really feeling that because you feel like they're part of your family and so in,0.023226883
this regard I give it an 8 out of 10 which is pretty high which,0.093486905
means there's a strong emotional pull and that's very important for a movie because if,0.016239794
it doesn't make you feel something then what's the point really you're watching it in,0.023184976
a category of intangibility z-- it's my term of putting the things that make movies,0.030281154
special in of themself I like bringing it movies like Footloose the original what a,0.105869964
movie really wasn't really good but because of the soundtrack and because some of the,0.023816235
dance scenes similarly to dirty dancing not really a great movie but because you have,0.23309834
a couple of good actors that we had to get chemistry on-screen and of course,0.025495159
the soundtrack makes the movie much better than it was and so he's probably call,0.02309451
the intangibles and it can vary from anything it can be a great direction it,0.03596382
can be great scene or so forth but this particular film I give it a,0.02913571
seven because it's a masterful film in terms of how it with shots how it,0.10369149
slits the pan and scan thing that it does constantly it's annoying but by the,0.058238823
third act you will understand with you quickly why it's doing that and it pays,0.06499909
off in the end it's really brilliant work of a camera movement you probably wouldn't,0.04440167
work on most films but for this one I think it was actually so yeah,0.06936402
so yeah I give a seven for intangibility in a category on watchability this is,0.031378042
word it's pretty weak because you see at one time you pretty much done I,0.08326303
give it a five now this could change in that area but I don't want,0.029009989
to rush back to watch this movie anytime soon so a 5-4 watch building my,0.056854576
overall rating which is a weighted average against the other four this is a really,0.038045842
big piece of it it's kind of when you see a movie what you feel,0.08674727
after you see it what's your overall impression I give it a 6 which is,0.040553585
better than average and so weight against the others the movie comes out in pretty,0.08078123
good footing my conservators take on Roma and by the way from here on out,0.09814918
we're gonna have the spoiler section here so if you don't wanna know anything about,0.05123045
the movie specifically just fast-forward to the end or check the time index and jump,0.02864946
above to where you want to go for the review in terms of my conservative,0.025894934
take on this film just that much booty to to be ball cat this movie,0.10388971
is based on the experiences from the director himself and so I don't have any,0.016795222
reason to give that a negative mark so for the most part I'm giving this,0.08097081
movie a green light the deal with the movie and the pan and scan toward,0.01441719
the end when the kids are in the ocean and they're about to drown you,0.3246769
don't know where they are and how pans off camera and comes back to them,0.1215224
that's probably the most important aspect of this film is the most powerful aspect to,0.017342668
this film and it kind of ties in all that direction toward the end and,0.03182305
so I think that over ways everything that the love of a housekeeper who had,0.07742671
her own problems with her miscarriage which by the way is a really really powerful,0.13026558
scene that if you don't get emotional in that then you probably don't have a,0.01921915
pulse a person who loves these kids as if they were her own and risks,0.104169086
her own life because she can't swim to save these kids that's that's that's the,0.06914983
movie that's that's the crux in the movie so my final take on this film,0.044890583
is a score of 12.5 which translates to three stars out of four or three-and-a-half,0.03125831
stars out of five so with that coming below if you like this movie did,0.041911893
you like it did you want to see you want to see it if you've,0.060811087
