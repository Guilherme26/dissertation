"If you Smile through your fear and sorrow,",0.13095123
Smile,0.044825
"and maybe tomorrow,",0.032524183
"you'll see the Sun come shining through, for you,",0.07748429
"light up your face with gladness, hide every trace of sadness,",0.31439546
"although a tear may be ever so near,",0.07475859
"that's the time you must keep on trying, Smile what's the use of crying, you'll find that life is still worthwhile,",0.19250607
"if you just Smile! You'll find the life's worthwhile... If you, just Smile! ""Modern ""Times"" is NoPerfectMovie! ""Ha-Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha""! Hats off to anyone who actually understood that reference by the way, I'm sure there's at least one or two... anyways,",0.15558486
"I'm hoping- Grandma, Grandpa, you know",0.1175512
what I'm talking about-don't,0.08624602
"you? Anyways, ""Modern Times"" was Charlie Chaplin's last film as the Little Tramp, who in this movie is living in the Great Depression,",0.3272447
he's struggling alongside,0.1225573
this orphan girl that he recently met (Paulette Goddard) because of two reasons: one being the tramps usual bad luck and two being how work industries were changing possibly for the worst at that time; businesses,0.3274584
were replacing manual labor with machinery for the sake of saving a profit,0.06802717
and the machinery that did require manual labour had,0.045363378
"so many advances that it became tough for labourers to handle the machinery in the first place, which of course leads to some of the best physical comedy in this movie! I was really excited to check out ""Modern Times"" because I've actually never seen a full-length silent movie, I've only seen clips from Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies in video essays as examples of really good sight gags and I agreed with all of that-I thought they were funny but I never really had the urge to check them out, plus streaming services have few to none in regards to silent movies because there really isn't that big of a demand other than huge, hardcore film aficionados",0.07559857
"but since I'm covering classical movies and I've always wanted to check out more silent movies anyways and with all the free time that I had, I gave ""Modern Times"" a view on Netflix and it was my first and thankfully not last silent movie I'll ever see because ""Modern Times"" was such a huge surprise in so many ways-the biggest surprise of course being with the with the physical comedy- with the slapstick!",0.17272094
You hear it all the time that Charlie Chaplin was a comedic genius in the silent era and I was hesitant to think that way because I'm not really a big fan of labeling directors as 'geniuses' or 'hacks',0.107502066
"but having seen this movie, Charlie Chaplin really was a comedic genius",0.11799389
because of how great he was at selling a laugh without any words whatsoever!,0.10368249
"It didn't matter if the gags were forced or obvious or so predictable that you could see them coming a mile away, what really matters",0.071838476
and what was Chaplin's greatest skill was his comedic timing and delivery because he and the other actors have these exaggerated facial expressions that tell you everything you need to know about,0.1190203
"these people without any dialogue whatsoever but never to a point where it felt cartoony or unrealistic,",0.109162726
if anything the stunts in this movie seen as plausible as you could possibly get,0.102594964
"and that's because the gags and the reactions to the gags were (for the most part) done in one single take which made it feel real, made it feel impressive and made us understand these characters as people while still laughing at them because that's something that slapstick comedies often don't really understand: these sight gags, the reactions-especially matters so much to the characters and in many cases the reactions matter more than the pratfalls because the Tramp has 2 recurring reactions that really sum him up as a character;",0.19041811
one is this dumbfounded look of confusion that happens for two reasons-one of which is when he's in the wrong place in the wrong time and he's in he's an innocent person who doesn't understand what's going on,0.4024809
"and he suffers for it, or the second one being when he has intentionally caused someone some problems",0.16052751
"and he just doesn't realize it,",0.08061799
"and the second expression is this very coy, guilty",0.090796575
smile,0.050986063
"that says that he understands the trouble that he's in, that he didn't mean any harm to anyone",0.12693472
and that he's willing to make amends with these people as opposed to just lashing out at each other,0.18018743
and that's kind of the reason that makes the Little Tramp such a likeable character;,0.22393127
"he is gullible,",0.44687515
"he is naive,",0.44710147
he does make a lot of stupid decisions but he never means any ill will of anyone,0.8606264
"and if he realizes that he made any mistakes, he'll feel guilty about it-he'll want to help anyone as quickly as possible and it's what leads him to making",0.0924004
so many lasting friendships in each of his movies. It's a character trope,0.16277552
and it's a character personality that I think any casual audience can really understand and relate to; we've all made dumb mistakes without the intention of hurting people,0.5064636
"and if we have, we feel guilty about it, we want to make amends and that's what really makes him such a realistic and likeable character, it makes it a lot easier to laugh for him",0.09799877
and at the people that he's causing trouble and mischief to and it also makes us feel a little sad whenever the slapstick happens to him because we've latched on to him as a character so much! But one of (for me) the best qualities about this movie and something that I think gets overlooked about silent movies 'cause,0.19845855
"I don't hear people talk about this that much, the music! Chaplin was one of the few directors who actually did the musical score for his own films",0.15782262
there's been some complaints about the assistants,0.06270143
"he's worked with who some feel have contributed more to the music,",0.06675538
"but his primary assistant on ""Modern Times"" and I'm gonna try and get this guy's name right here,",0.24093741
"let's see... David Raskin described his creative process when it came to writing a musical score; Chaplin knew how to play piano, violin and cello... what he didn't know how to do was read or write sheet music",0.09089969
so whenever Chaplin knew what each scene sounded like in his own head,0.33555087
he would improvise some notes on a piano or he would humming out loud and Raskin would write down exactly what he was humming and put it to sheet music so that they can get a clearer idea of how to record the music and more importantly synchronize it to the movie to each scene-to each pratfall because the music really does elevate the over-the-top expressions that these characters give or the much more somber and sad moments in the movie a lot more depth &,0.12895583
"tension whenever there's a pratfall, the music makes it seem so whimsical & cheerful because what we're watching is funny but with the dramatic scenes-especially with the song ""Smile"" which he wrote the music-he didn't write the lyrics, the lyrics came around the Nat King Cole times when that song became popular but especially with that romance theme, it has this somber but bittersweet sense of hope because the thing that I didn't anticipate going into this movie was that ""Modern Times"" was kind of a comedy-drama, especially when they introduced this orphaned girl and when she comes across the Tramp, they have this abrupt romance but you still buy into it because they do have a lot of things in",0.15330857
"common ;they have no one else in their lives to depend upon-no friends or family anymore, they make a lot of morally questionable choices for really no reason other than",0.07177423
"survival. They don't do it because they want to, they do it because they feel as if they have to and in some cases... yeah, they probably",0.079558335
did and they even do have some greedy,0.32714507
moments-especially,0.056776546
"when they're crashing this department store and they're trying on these new shoes and sleeping in these beds, I noticed very closely that most of the characters in this movie wear black on the outside and white on the inside to symbolize that they're poor but at one point the orphaned girl puts on these white bedsheets and lies in this all-white bed, these silk cushions and these very furry blankets that symbolize their fantasies, their temptations that they want for their own lives",0.32748425
"and then once they snap back into the black on the outside, white on the inside it's that difference between fantasy and reality that makes it really hard to contribute colour symbolism to a black-and-white movie but Charlie Chaplin really did find a way to make it work!",0.26727515
Now as for problems,0.15037474
I do feel as if the orphaned girl (while she was still really good as an actress,0.24015574
"and as a character) there are some things about her backstory that I thought were gonna have more involvement with in regards this story but after a while, after this really shitty occurrence happens in her life that changes everything for her, everything else that matters",0.6046394
to her- every other person that she's met they become practically non-existent,0.25223592
and then all she can think about is having a life with the Tramp,0.33853218
(she has fantasies that are exclusively him,0.10560489
and none of these other people that are in a worse situation that she can't depend upon) but I was under the impression that she would later come back to help them out,0.18626872
"but that wasn't the case, maybe she thought that it was too late for her to do something like that",0.09734449
"and if so, I can completely understand that because the morals are about how the world is a really unfortunate place",0.14474933
and there are always going to be consequences whether you're innocent or guilty of something,0.13610822
"but it's no reason to not move forward,",0.04795977
it's no reason to give up because you don't know what lies ahead of you,0.35915077
"and leads to a fantastic ending, a fantastic final shot that is iconic among Chaplin fans",0.40312228
and I completely agree!,0.030616155
"If you've never seen a silent movie before, definitely seek out ""Modern Times"" on Netflix! iIt is really funny,",0.108504154
"it's also really sad, the music is top-notch, the actors all do fantastic work just with their facial expressions and body language in ways that modern actors... I'm not entirely sure if they can do just as well anymore, they can obviously do well on their own but compared to actors who did it because they had no choice, I'm not entirely sure but who knows, maybe in the future this this genre of silent era might become popular again, who knows? So for all those reasons, I'm gonna give ""Modern Times"" 4/5! Guys, thanks as always for watching! If you have seen ""Modern Times"", let me know in the comments below what you thought of it!

and don't forget to smile!,0.091713354
