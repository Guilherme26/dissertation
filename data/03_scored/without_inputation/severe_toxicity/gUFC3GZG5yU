really funny at times with the running time of three and a half hours its,0.017449763
consensus longest film and I was a little bit afraid that it might turn out,0.09861414
kind of episodic because it is primarily distributed on Netflix and they might have unofficially,0.036434103
divided it in smaller parts so it's easier to watch for an hour and continue,0.06175831
the next day but in my very positive surprise the Irishman definitely feels like a,0.041875307
complete picture and as someone who's a big fan of tight movies that don't waste,0.09101974
a lot of screen time I was also surprised that I pretty much cherished every,0.016424714
minute of it I think you could possibly cut it down a little bit and,0.288555
just left off some of the shown events but I also think that it all,0.013362874
adds to the feeling of a long travel and recollection of a man's life that,0.049810283
is unfolding in front of our eyes like I said I watched it on the,0.042648915
big screen the house was packed and the is rather narrow I guess for the,0.02162645
last hour so I kind of had to go to the bathroom but because I,0.04168706
didn't want to disturb anyone and also because the movie was dead captivating I just,0.045684814
didn't go and I really didn't mind that much because I was really glued to,0.015113638
the screen Martin Scorsese with almost 80 years old is still a filmmaker full of,0.020586103
energy full of passion full of wit and drive and he Irishman's 209 minutes a,0.118824415
packed with amazing scenes and it's not just the best off of his previous gangster,0.17743374
movies it's its own thing of course it revisits familiar but away it taketh its,0.03104279
story and also the way this whole project is coming together on a meta level,0.014965967
with the Niro Pacino and Pesci United and also portraying their characters at different ages,0.016402097
over the course of a lifetime and three and a half hours of movie time,0.021960372
is simply remarkable and in the hands of such a brilliant filmmaker this can set,0.013750676
you in a stage of absolute bliss the film is moving on three different timelines,0.01874421
which it is constantly and effortlessly jumping back and forth to in typical Scorsese fashion,0.02803882
we get one of those super long continuous takes but this time not through a,0.032157637
casino but through the hallways of a nursing home where the old aged Frank Sheeran,0.031637464
is sitting in a wheelchair and recollects the events of his life to the audience,0.09026475
we also have the younger but still very old Frank who is taking a road,0.034181125
trip to Detroit with his friend Russel played by Joe Pesci they are on their,0.03154035
way to a wedding and we know that there will be another very important event,0.013423406
happening at their destination then we have the third and I would say main timeline,0.02676433
which chronicles Frank's life in the Mafia this timeline sets in sometime in the 1950s,0.03459886
and then progresses through the years until we end up at the road trip and,0.03653122
then even later at him being in that nursing home there's another jump back in,0.03209644
time to Frank's time in the war but that's just a very small scene now,0.066164486
let's talk about a negative the Irishman is already very famous for its extensive use,0.068474
of digital DEA agent technology or Uthoff occasion we see all three main characters as,0.0175522
well as many side characters at different stages of their lives but instead of casting,0.029967854
other younger actors it's really the Niro Pacino and Pesci who are playing the parts,0.07025803
with their faces digitally changed to look younger the first time we cut to the,0.12224013
Nero's Frank as a young man in his late 30s or early 40s I guess,0.028924845
is really off-putting I assume you've all seen the trailers for the Irishman and you,0.030406876
probably noticed the effect as well unfortunately it doesn't look better in the finished film,0.07295867
oftentimes it's not that easy not to think of the Nero's characters some kind of,0.027154792
video game character I think what makes it worse as the fact that they gave,0.061959196
him blue eyes because the real Frank had blue eyes of course it has always,0.043743808
been a common practice to change someone's iCal on screen by wearing contacts or by,0.062458083
digital effects but all the de-aging combined with those striking blue eyes of Frank it,0.056996927
felt really weird and your brain just instantly knows that this isn't right and as,0.15736116
a consequence I had a rather hard time for a very long time to fully,0.04563226
investigate into the Niro's character because it wasn't easy to even accept him as a,0.029397126
real person fortunately though the effect somehow works much better for Pacino and Pesci it's,0.032471605
also noticeable in certain moments but somehow they seem to be much closer to reality,0.031134585
and not in that uncanny valley De Niro's character ISM but I can also assure,0.02439295
you that the film is strong enough and that you get used to it maybe,0.020402513
because your brain just gives up at some point and accepts it so it's really,0.2088823
not a deal-breaker at all in the end and it also gets better as the,0.02775745
movie progresses because the depicted time period is allowing the Niro to get closer and,0.011988604
closer to his real age which means that by the time you should be invested,0.030621065
most into the story it's also the time he looks the most natural and even,0.028950123
though the nura look sweet in many scenes the whole first hour so well as,0.029582713
well as the rest of the film holds so many wonderful gangster scenes that reminded,0.03835582
me so much about my love for the grand theft auto video game series the,0.031781144
title of the book the movies based on is I hurt you paint houses and,0.032516837
this can actually be considered the unofficial title of the irishman as well because the,0.028354783
title the irishman only appears on screen at the very end but at the beginning,0.11324286
it's I hurt you paint houses in big white letters on black only that Frank's,0.36006868
painting houses with the blood of the people he is supposed to eliminate there are,0.2606328
so many little and bigger gangster scenes and the way the film portrays it's different,0.123365626
time periods is handled with such an eye for detail like I said it's a,0.031542342
pure joy and this is a movie that stuffed with great characters and great actors,0.030821284
from Harvey Keitel to Ray Romano everybody shines and what a gift it is that,0.01825131
we got back Pesce to portray the gangster boss Russell Bufalino this is a true,0.044268638
master performance unfolding on-screen and unlike other Pesci roads we have seen normally you would,0.034874912
expect him to play someone explosive unpredictable and overtly violent and yes there is a,0.10747239
glimpse of what Russell has done in the past but mostly it's him overseeing his,0.020254176
men and I was really surprised what kind of warmth this character was losing Pesci,0.08502444
brings so much gravitas to the film and it makes you understand how Frank was,0.009420331
drawn to him and this lifestyle but the one who is killing it the most,0.28644705
is Al Pacino he plays the union leader Jimmy Hoffa and it takes some time,0.02403375
and here we are being introduced to him this marks the first time Scorsese work,0.046125166
with Pacino and what an energy he is bringing to the table be prepared for,0.022526445
that Pacino rage the screaming the cursing the intimidation but also for a fully fleshed,0.31452373
out character who becomes the central point of conflict throughout the story in the hands,0.027500687
of the right people you simply get this special kind of movie magic and to,0.077634916
see the friendship between Frank and Jimmy form and where it goes is mesmerizing and,0.018756183
the West Coast says he directs his actors and how the scenes are unfolding is,0.02508208
so great these characters have so much personality and just to watch them talk with,0.022753272
one another is amazing and the Irishman always succeeds on both fields creating this highly,0.038382426
entertaining fun gangster film full of great dialogues about coming to lay two meetings what,0.08595636
kind of clothes to wear and the beauty of saddle or not so subtle meanings,0.038160257
behind specific words and then on the other side is since see a human drama,0.051259715
and distance deconstruction of this gangster lifestyle this is what Scorsese can do so well,0.13597019
and there are times where the Irishman can be the greatest romp and then there,0.061782923
are times where it's really mature and revealing how empty these lives truly are for,0.06496782
a long time I wasn't so sure who this Frank Sheeran actually is what are,0.028188488
his goals his real ambitions what is he seeking in life the film takes us,0.03899373
on a journey and we are always with him yet he stays kind of and,0.020150408
big years maybe it needs to repeat watches but maybe this is also kind of,0.023713132
the point we never really get to know him that closely I think a very,0.022250393
important aspect of the film is his relationship to one of his four daughters from,0.017504308
a very early age on his Peggy was always troubled by his obvious links to,0.025886286
the underworld and what her father is capable of doing and their relationship gets only,0.081014045
more difficult in time for some time I thought to myself that we really don't,0.019514492
know anything about her character and that she's just another female character who seems to,0.11230362
be very underwritten but I think again that that's exactly the point the whole film,0.021179447
is told through Frank's perspective and not really to get to know that much about,0.00974228
his daughter is only logical because it underlines that he was never really able to,0.091033705
create a meaningful bond with her his way of life was always in the way,0.040412568
and then for the film won't give us and won't give him the pleasure of,0.020646635
really getting to know her I really think that the Irishman is a remarkable film,0.033986893
and there's of course a lot more that I could talk about from the music,0.021434877
to the camera and editing from the period settings to the emotional finale to the,0.036262486
way the food portrays eating it's a super rich film that deserves your attention I,0.15296231
