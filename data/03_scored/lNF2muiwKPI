the black clansmen hi my name is Kyle Suggs and welcome to my channel and,0.11154764
I'm going to give you my conservative take and we're going to start right now,0.07736843
so the way this works is I'm gonna give you my movie review based on,0.15508536
five categories and of those five categories and we're gonna score it and I'm giving,0.05585132
you a four star rating after that I'm gonna give you a conservative take on,0.08127537
whether or not you should go not go or to go with caution now mind,0.15246908
you this section will include spoilers but I will indicate that above and you can,0.10970095
skip over that if you like to do that go into the description and look,0.08378748
for the index and you can skip forward to anywhere in the video okay so,0.07575499
now with that let's get started so the black clansmen is Spike Lee his latest,0.3890115
movie it came out in 2018 it stars John David Washington as Ron star worth,0.068216555
as well as Adam driver and it's a based on a true story about an,0.051398214
infiltration of the police into the Ku Klux Klan and it's interesting because Ron star,0.43006447
Werth happens to be black and so this story is pretty interesting because obviously it's,0.34017158
very difficult for a black person to join the Klan and so Adam driver is,0.6342989
a person who actually helps with this sting operation and so as far as the,0.10050704
story is concerned it's a pretty decent story it goes forward with Ron stallworth goes,0.06401798
to college campus he meets a woman that he falls in love with and ends,0.2916707
up finding out that there is a gentleman there who's the political person and they're,0.10822224
worried about potential Black Panther uprisings and so he's supposed to be spying on that,0.2769794
but to find out he actually decides to let's do this and infiltrate the Ku,0.09345703
Klux Klan so he gains permission to do that and then escapades ensue so as,0.19235143
far as the story is concerned it's pretty cut and dry but since it's a,0.06285485
true story I'll give this rating a 7 as far as the emotional impact in,0.03478286
this movie I don't feel much I mean I'm a black man and I still,0.54096234
didn't really get any movement in my emotions one way or the other out of,0.07642027
sort of what blase I was expecting something a little bit more powerful but it,0.16615123
was trying to be a comedy and then trying to get serious so it really,0.12617813
didn't have any impact because I didn't really know what it wanted to do in,0.054083746
terms of its tone and so yeah I give it a 5 as far as,0.06326266
the intangibles for this movie again this movie doesn't have much it doesn't jump out,0.079412445
at you the direction is anything spectacular it's it's okay there's the acting is okay,0.2723705
I guess the screenplay is so so again the mood of the film is all,0.052178893
over the place you don't know this wants to be a comedy if it wants,0.2584429
to be serious what is it I think Spike Lee just kind of phoned this,0.094213694
one in and he expected this to actually be you know an oscar-worthy movie so,0.11334488
for the intangibles I'm getting a 5 as far as watch ability I give it,0.09188891
a 4 because I don't really want to see it again and I don't want,0.09370316
to recommend it the last few minutes just destroys the movie it's too much on,0.16957574
the nose and that's nothing about this film he does stuff that's way over the,0.25051427
top and it's like the messaging is just in your face punch you with no,0.8060606
subtlety whatsoever it's a clear propaganda piece and I don't want to see it again,0.18054928
and I don't want to recommend it my overall rating for this film it's going,0.1384521
to be a 6 and that's highly generous because I mean I guess there is,0.037744798
some decent acting in here and it is fairly well put together but the story,0.053317986
isn't really good the soundtrack or the score really isn't that memorable the climax in,0.061388955
it into the film is a misnomer it's poorly directed by the way this is,0.10739074
a spoiler section not that you they care anyway but just so you know so,0.10772704
Spike Lee at the end of the movie does a three or four minute montage,0.0628472
on the Charlottesville incident where he takes the president out of contact saying that there,0.06416878
are good people on on all sides the actual quote I'll put up on the,0.05057634
screen is not what he said in the context and if you look at the,0.061903816
actual situation there Charles Vil it's a lot differently what the media was portraying it,0.0498517
and if that's all he has to lay on the president's feet in terms of,0.15053894
being racist well I mean that's pretty that's pretty weak and he tries to draw,0.51146436
loose comparisons to America first about the plan using that slogan and he's obviously taking,0.14714564
a dig at Americans and that's also very weak considering the fact that Spike Lee,0.23137422
wants to essentially say that he's for illegal aliens over Americans that's that's the messaging,0.46242303
the America first it's put legal Americans first over illegal aliens and here you have,0.40038332
a guy who talks about the bondage of the African people of African despo yet,0.7163826
he wants to put the people that struggled hard for over a hundred years where,0.085697375
they actually were whipped beaten lynched he's gonna put these people in the descendants of,0.7308018
these people in the back of the bus for illegal aliens which is essentially what,0.47320548
you're saying I think now is a good time to mention to spike that every,0.19409147
person every races that was depicted in this movie by an actor was a Democrat,0.237295
that includes George Wallace that includes President Woodrow Wilson and yes even includes your main,0.117312014
antagonist David Duke at a time of this occurrence in history David Duke was a,0.12455152
Democrat and though some of you may be saying hey but the party switched and,0.107001565
so forth well that's not true it's very easily debunked I will leave a link,0.08680143
below of a video that I did that's very well documented called the three ways,0.14039873
to prove that the parties never switched so check that out and also his messaging,0.110023856
he comes out and says you know what he says well once you go out,0.108418986
and get a gun he has Stokely Carmichael who was presented in the movie who,0.25169274
basically whisper in the lead actresses ear saying go get a gun and arm yourself,0.71561897
delete a character stallworth and the female lead here knock on the door they go,0.13981323
grab their guns and go out Blake blazing but they go out of the sea,0.48278365
what's outside and of course it's a cross burning in the backyard and it goes,0.27730668
into this montage it makes no sense whatsoever but at the same time he wants,0.17327394
to have the socialist liberal mentality in terms of an victimization of Africans but he,0.4033151
wasn't turn around and say go and get a gun so that's totally hypocritical in,0.62087077
terms of the messaging front coming from the left so I don't know what Specter,0.12996462
he's trying to do and then he wants at the full on the Oscars and,0.060941495
put down the green book as if his movie is so much better well spike,0.24541733
your movie was not that much better in fact it was horrible in comparison no,0.31089434
one's claiming that spike always want to have an Oscar to his name for Best,0.057487343
Picture he got Best Screenplay he shared it with three others and by the way,0.06743889
he was only person to actually speak during that ceremony so spike in there what,0.14766042
man you really dropped the ball on this one and you really showed yourself on,0.42062134
this and no no one needs to go see this film the little bit that,0.21248117
it was good you've ruined it towards the end with that out of context montage,0.26307926
racist crap that she put out there trying to portray people in a light that,0.9017795
they weren't supposed to be so that's my rant and I'm done with that so,0.07703275
my final take on this movie is basically it's a rating of 11 out of,0.17785195
score of 20 it's a two and a half star movie there's some few things,0.06875236
in there that keep it from being a total piece of crap but two and,0.88124174
a half stars definitely dunkels see this and so with that I'm done and if,0.094878286
