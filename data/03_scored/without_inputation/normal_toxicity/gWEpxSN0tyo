good morning in the afternoon everyone i am dorm this is dorm shoes,0.07133642
welcome back to dorm film where we're talking about movies uh today we're gonna be talking about a night at the opera this movie's from 1935 and boy does it show it uh so i literally just watched this i finished watching it as i was eating dinner and came in here to record this immediately after i have a bit of mixed feelings on this one there there's a lot to like about it,0.07830031
there's also a lot for me personally that just kind of i kind of lost the plot a little bit,0.20417549
so uh this movie is a marx brothers festival i guess because groucho chico and harpo are all in this i'm a big fan of groucho marx i was when i was like a teenager anyway just like reading his quotes and stuff i don't know that i've ever watched a full groucho marx like film i've definitely watched clips and stuff on youtube but don't know that i've ever actually sat down to watch a full garage remarks film this film also is on the afi top 100 list that we were discussing last time with the apartment,0.20524323
uh this is number 85 on that list and to say that it's one of the 100 greatest films of all time for me personally,0.12216608
i don't really get it,0.10489374
i really love groucho marx and i think he is at his most brilliant when it's very dialogue heavy one of the knocks on this film for me is how little dialogue,0.2782606
there is there are large sort of swaths of movie that are just either songs which to me weren't very entertaining or just like musical breaks or uh sort of more like slapstick physical comedy that stuff is great and i don't i don't hate those kind of things,0.1832281
but when i came into it expecting like a big groucho marx movie and it starts out so great with just groucho marx just doing a lot of dialogue in the first probably 10-15 minutes i was very optimistic,0.21671887
i think as the movie goes along it gets worse and worse for me by the end i kept checking to see how long how much time was left and yeah which which i don't like because i like this sort of older style of movie i like the silliness and the fact that the movie can just exist to be a a sort of vehicle for fun little one-liners and zings and zangs,0.31089434
one of my biggest problems with the movie though is that it really doesn't feel like a film rather than a bunch of little skits sort of stitched together,0.239699
and i know that that's probably indicative of the mark's style right like a lot of a lot of those movies i'm assuming the plot just exists for one-liners,0.08698327
and that's fine,0.063073695
i don't mind that at all,0.090945885
but the plot here is very thin,0.115401834
uh there is a love story going on with with two two two of the characters that i was not invested in at all,0.04777042
and the this that's sort of the through line throughout the movie is just that relationship that love story and it just wasn't enough to draw me in um,0.06561886
i'm going to contrast this movie with something with a movie that i really like from the same era bringing up baby from 1938,0.24046361
i also just watched this year for the first time and that movie does a much better job,0.046914283
in my opinion having a likable love story um having a plot that yes is funny but and facilitates really good little scenes of humor,0.10824935
but is also an interesting plot and also just is a better through line even if that movie too kind of loses it a little bit by the end not nearly as much,0.110788986
as this movie does i i am pretty easy to get on board i will i will give most movies a thumbs up uh and i didn't hate this movie it was easily watchable there were some movies that or there,0.06608441
were some lines rather that i just i was laugh out loud laughing at from groucho,0.15060079
and i just wanted more of that i wanted more of that zany snappy sort of dialogue that he's known for,0.10248586
and we got a couple of those,0.05408079
there's there's a scene where he's alone in a room at a table and and three other guys have just kind of left to go hide in the closet as a cop comes and investigates uh the room and the cops like oh i see you have a table set for four and groucho goes,0.30108503
oh that's nothing,0.09816543
i have my alarm set for eight a little stuff like that i absolutely love,0.061368346
there's one of the two of the three sort of stowaway characters one of which is the love story guy the other two are chico and harpo are tucked away in his trunk in groucho's trunk he opens the trunk to see two of them,0.20287335
and he's like where are my other clothes,0.10743254
and they say they sold them or whatever and he's like well that's okay,0.15488592
i keep a shirt tucked away in this drawer,0.22216995
and he opens the drawer and it's i think it's harpo,0.1006263
it's either chico or harpo he's asleep snoring and groucho goes,0.25883818
well that's not my shirt,0.09394179
my shirt doesn't snore,0.08654575
i love lines like that i love little dialogue moments like that,0.07774431
and i just wanted more of that from this movie i think this movie is at its best,0.07032717
when groucho is talking uh i don't really love chico and harpo from this film their best scene to me is sort of the instrumental back and forth so throughout the course of the movie there are these song breaks that while i get is just like old hollywood right like a lot of a lot of old movies are pseudo musicals,0.18866378
even if they're not actual musicals and i get it especially with a movie called a night of the opera that you have to have some songs the songs suck,0.7093121
i i will not find myself singing any of these songs tomorrow they're they're just they're just not good,0.26218462
and maybe that's because they're an opera song from the 30s right like that is pretty pretty uh far away pretty detached from what we're used to with music,0.10277053
but even like going back and watching other musicals from that era and stuff there are far catchier songs than this sort of kind of style going on and it's just to me,0.057749648
it's not captivating to me,0.14206469
that was when i was checking my phone and not really paying attention to the movie i think that afi at least with my experience,0.09620587
so far i've seen about 25 of the movies of the top 100 um a lot of which are from this sort of golden era,0.05416488
i think we can give those movies a little too much credit like yes,0.10222252
i know that they are trend setting,0.04930007
yes,0.036876976
i know without them,0.32577494
we wouldn't have a lot of the sort of snappy dialogue comedies later on um,0.09261036
i just don't think this is the finest example of that uh and i i'm looking forward to seeing duck soup which i know i think is just groucho as opposed to the entire marx family i think there could be too much marks in a movie so i'm looking forward to seeing duck soup and seeing how that contrasts with this for me personally i was very unimpressed with this movie really i liked the first half a lot more than the second,0.20481993
the second is really when they start hammering in the sort of the the music,0.12539311
and the more physical scenes,0.07534328
oh i was gonna say,0.10345527
so uh there's a there's a scene where they're singing on a boat and then uh chico and harpo kind of go back and forth on the piano and harp and it's a fun scene um especially uh whichever one i think it's harpo the groucho is the easy one because he has a mustache,0.44113865
the other two i get confused uh harpo does a really fun piano scene where he's sort of entertaining the kids on the ship and like does a lot of little slapstick stuff like closes,0.4077677
the lid of the piano on his hand and then he pretends like his hand is limp,0.41449684
and then he can only get it when he rocks it back forward,0.074740924
and then he goes limp again like that's it's a really fun little little scene,0.31089434
um that that scene and a couple other scenes in this movie feel a little masturbatory from the marks like hey we can do,0.6364068
this thing really well we can do piano really well or we can play hard really well or whatever,0.09303293
so we have to have that scene in the movie like plot-wise,0.120902665
it made no sense why this random these random two stowaways or just having an instrument battle for 15 minutes um,0.08973074
and i get that it's like an iconic scene and stuff but at the same time,0.09559685
why like why does it,0.0758849
why does it need to be in the movie ultimately i i do enjoy films of this of this ilk um,0.12319431
i i really do like sort of old hollywood and i like groucho marx and i like some of the lines in it some of the dialogue was really really funny at the same time as a movie the plot is almost non-existent um,0.19296663
and if the one-liners aren't there to carry the plot then the movie falls apart and a lot of the movie just isn't dialogue,0.05247426
it's it's physical comedy that again,0.100094065
i don't hate but it just doesn't play super well 80 years removed from it right with that being said uh i'm giving night at the opera two and a half stars to me three stars is like an average good recommended movie uh a night the opera for me falls a little bit short of that i just think it's okay,0.13562395
and i think two and a half stars is about okay um,0.06179798
so i'm giving it two and a half stars,0.04434641
