book-smart is the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde and tells the tale of two seniors who are about to graduate who have spent their entire high school years intensely studying never missing a project,0.15257588
never missing homework always trying their best to get into a great college,0.06700841
and when they discover that other kids in school did party but are somehow still getting into good colleges they feel like,0.06385709
they missed a huge opportunity,0.044469785
they have one more night,0.056296047
before graduation they decide to spend that entire night finding the best party they can in today's world of internet ratings tomato meter Metacritic IMDB you can really start to get expectations for a movie that aren't necessary,0.06602412
this is a well-made comedy directed by somebody who understands the genre especially for a directorial debut and it has two really good performances in it that really boost the film and make it something that's going to be impactful for today's generation,0.050729997
it's very quotable,0.1145492
it has a lot of funny scenes,0.08680611
it was hard to escape trailers for it though because just about every film I went to had a trailer for it,0.046661064
and I don't really like to know that much about films I try to avoid as much as I can going in so I can go into the film just not knowing anything so that I can have a fresh experience and hopefully be surprised so it was nice to see a comedy without,0.06250325
all of the best jokes spoiled for me like most comedy trailers do the film also has a really good sense of immediacy because a large chunk of it takes place over the course of one night so you feel like you're really there with these people it never feels like it's really stopping or slowing down,0.15218747
and it's like this constant sequence of events that continues to be entertaining,0.10168614
it actually builds an entertainment value as the film goes along it doesn't really peak,0.051170133
necessarily at any one point,0.052693803
and by the end of the film I found myself wrapped up in these characters lives,0.062474113
I actually cared about them,0.0801803
I wanted them to be in a happy place,0.07364117
I wanted to see them succeed and that's when I knew the film had completely won me over,0.05577504
sometimes though the film can feel a little fantastical as if characters are in a scene improving playing off a joke playing off,0.0720354
the other actor and you can sort of see this improvisational sequence just played to its extremes on film,0.07498337
sometimes when you're watching a movie especially comedies you can feel when they're going off script and riffing off one another sometimes it's hilarious and sometimes it were for the character other times it feels like they're going for a laugh,0.07264558
and the laugh just isn't coming,0.08280911
there's a few sequences like that in the movie that don't always land for me,0.0510292
but that's subjective comedies gonna be that way,0.050658103
that's why it's so hard to direct comedies which is why I have a lot of respect for Olivia Wilde for going out there and making this her directorial debut and actually having a vision for it because it does feel unique,0.15166934
it does have a unique look to it,0.05666961
it feels as if she brought something to this project,0.09392436
there's an energy to it,0.05751151
there's a vibrancy to it,0.05639234
and a lot of that energy is because of excellent performances by Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein these two girls play off each other wonderfully they're supposed to have a very deep friendship these two characters right down to them knowing some seriously fucked-up secrets about the other person and you can feel that on screen it felt completely authentic their relationship was fleshed out even though you didn't really know that much about their past just in minimal dialogue throughout their conversation,0.5816263
over,0.037069574
the course of this night you can begin to feel as if these characters existed before the movie began and they will continue to exist after it ends which is one of the best compliments that you can give to a film character is that you feel like these people have lives beyond the confines of the film you're watching,0.063900635
but one thing I definitely noticed is that the film relies very heavily on music whether it's a song or musical score,0.04065834
there is rarely a scene that doesn't have one of those sometimes that can get overpowering it's relying a little too heavily on music for that emotional manipulation rather than script and character especially in one sequence my favorite scene in the entire film is when two characters are having this really big argument,0.060854558
it's done,0.055788357
in one take the actors are doing an amazing job,0.06447924
it was actually really powerful,0.051094733
and I thought it was great work,0.066875264
and then all of a sudden during this sequence the actors voices is drowned out from the mix taken all the way down to zero and musical score is suddenly over them and they're arguing now and their mouths are moving but no sounds coming out,0.075808555
and we just have this booming musical score and to me that was a betrayal of these amazing performances and again overly relying on music when you didn't have to have the music they're they're sequences throughout the movie that really rely early on very noticeable musical edits sometimes you cut to an exterior shot of a house music is super,0.11231551
loud then we cut to inside the house,0.16562372
and all of a sudden SRIA lis quiet the movie is trying to jar you with its choices with music,0.0889779
and sometimes it works,0.052462883
and sometimes I think they should have just relied on these two great actresses,0.13758375
and what they were already bringing to the movie beyond that though I think this is a really fun movie with two great performances and I want to see what else Olivia Wilde does because I think she has a lot of talent go out and see this movie supported at the box office it's a small film and I want to see movies like this succeed,0.115254655
I'm gonna give book-smart a B guys,0.4486763
thank you so much,0.046055436
