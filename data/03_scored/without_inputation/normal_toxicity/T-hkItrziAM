let's do this,0.085808925
so the last Jedi picks up right after the events of the force awakens rey is seeking out Luke Skywalker in hopes that he can train her and return to help save the resistance meanwhile the first order is attempting to end the resistance once and for all and that's all I'm gonna say about the plot and the setup because this is a spoiler free review and I will be putting out a spoiler full review on Sunday,0.06381642
with that said the last Jedi was good but it left me with so many mixed feelings,0.107051246
now before I dive into my full thoughts be sure to put your thoughts down below in the comment section,0.24017651
tell me what you liked what you hated about it but avoid spoilers in the comment section on this particular video also stick around to the end of this video to learn how you might be able to appear,0.18883441
in one of my future videos using the start of staff,0.06924833
with that said let's start talking about the best things about this movie the best thing about this film is,0.08526989
it's a character based film where each of the characters have a journey thereon of discovery and there's a great performance backing that journey that they are on this might be the best we've ever seen Mark Hamill in this role and maybe ever in his entire acting career,0.06699594
Carrie,0.037999265
Fisher gives another amazing performance it just has such sadness in the character as she's seeing the world around her as she's fighting for hope once again Daisy Ridley is charming as she's ever been has met all these characters seem to be pretty charming,0.0818089
and likable in these roles,0.08751151
Brian Johnson brings possibly the most unique and distinct directorial style that we've seen in any Star Wars movie thus far with angles,0.05335781
he uses the look of it,0.09509781
and this is a gorgeous looking movie the action is shot with wide angles,0.1663747
you can see what's happening in the lightsaber battles there's little distinct things and our space battles and our land battles that just give them a unique look and that's all Ryan Johnson's action,0.056684136
and this is a movie that avoids the tendency of most sequels to just go bigger better bigger equals better,0.058460034
it doesn't do that,0.05914603
and while the stakes are more dire than ever and you feel the danger of everything happening,0.14112914
it's not because they're just making everything bigger whereas in previous Star Wars movies planets,0.085607156
what star systems are destroyed,0.13988654
there are death stars and star killer,0.40993515
bases this movie doesn't escalate stakes by just going bigger and makes it more personal,0.07087381
and it's directed in such a way that you actually fear that something bad could happen throughout the whole movie you just feel like the resistance could fall apart at any time,0.0849883
our good guys could turn to the dark side at any point in time it in that regard it's very much like Empire Strikes Back in that the story's not gigantic but it's personal and it matters in that regard it's very much like Empire Strikes Back,0.07418812
because the scope is smaller,0.087881014
it's more personal,0.07304667
but for some reason the stakes seems so much greater than they did before from there,0.052212253
let's move on to the parts that I had mixed feelings about this film constantly goes against your expectations,0.17357008
and then at the movies very unpredictable but it feels like it's unpredictable,0.09758019
for the purpose of being unpredictable for the sake of being unpredictable in that regard sometimes it feels hollow like moments will happen where you think there's gonna be substance to it something really unpredictable happens and you don't feel the emotional weight that you should feel there the audience had a reaction like oh that was shocking but you didn't feel substance to it it just felt like they were actively trying to go against whatever you thought was gonna happen or what could have happened just to make sure that the movie was unpredictable and in that I appreciated that it didn't play into what we expected or what we wanted then who took twists and turns but at the same time they didn't pay off the way,0.037522346
I felt like they should have the film also plays a good bit of homage to the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi,0.030019393
now what it doesn't do is use those films as a template like the force awakens did,0.093238324
but there was a lot of stuff that felt a little bit too familiar some of them was good perhaps and some of it felt a little bit too much like okay we have to have an element like this from one of these two movies and you could just feel where scenes were going because it was playing so much homage to previous films also the humor in this movie was a little bit mixed,0.08768433
certainly I laughed out loud it added a levity to a movie that had a lot of weight to it and a lot of Arcanist to it but the jokes didn't land as well as they did in the force awakens a lot more of them felt forced some of them felt like they were callbacks to the previous movie it was like,0.07589451
I don't think we need to do this,0.09984163
I'm cringing a little bit at how much you're trying to be JJ Abrams type funny speaking of JJ Abrams some of the mystery box type stuff that was set up in the previous film,0.09270598
this movie doesn't embarrass itself by trying to give answers that don't work,0.19157363
but it feels like it kind of shifts away and avoids answering some of those questions and so is the level pretty mixed bag on a lot of different things with this move,0.068375416
it wasn't like I hate this,0.27879885
it's not that loo,0.1044833
that's really bad,0.16695283
it was just kind of like okay that doesn't fully work as well as I think it should have,0.08719752
and with that said from there,0.03949631
let's move on to the worst aspects of this film,0.2606935
and by far the worst thing about this movie is a plotline involving Finn that just feels unnecessary,0.17028451
now in one sense it is necessary because it kind of links together a few plot points in it,0.07954103
but you feel throughout the whole thing like ooh you could have found a much smoother way to do this without having this gigantic rabbit trail,0.12563922
that's the least interesting thing about this movie like every time that we go off to cutaway to this other adventure,0.14542125
you're thinking man,0.09115222
I wish I was back with Luke and Rey man I wish it was with kylo Ren right now and it's not interesting,0.16999078
even the the design of the world where things kind of take place,0.083510764
and the characters there is some of the most bland stuff in any Star Wars movie ever you're just like wow this feels so la and possibly because of this subplot this movie is way too long for the type of story,0.15112069
that's being told,0.045396373
I mean the movie has a fairly straightforward narrative in the movies the longest Star Wars movie that's ever been put out and that's because you've got a few too many subplots going on and some of them are way too long and unnecessary for the type of movie that's being told here,0.084825516
and you feel that weight as the movie goes along and since so much stuff is going on it feels like the movie takes a long time to get started,0.09904742
and while the stakes of the movie give a sense of urgency to it the environments,0.09056129
and shots are used make the movie feel like,0.09446009
it's not moving forward,0.07674061
like there's several points in time where there's establishing shots that feel like haven't we seen this exact establishing shot four or five times already as it cuts back and forth between the three kind of plot lines that are going on also the script frequently uses miscommunication or bad communication as a way to kind of move the story forward and create conflict,0.055458207
but the end result is feeling a little bit like if people had just communicated information that they could have communicated you could have avoided big gigantic dire consequences and that's not really addressed within the movie and so it kind of popped out to me like shouldn't that have been addressed or should we come up with a better reason that they didn't have certain information so overall,0.07933277
this is a movie that I did enjoy,0.10563227
I do think it's a good movie but it is a movie that leaves you with all kinds of feelings that are all over the place that kind of demands additional viewings,0.07487043
and for that reason I'm not gonna put my rating in the movie just yet I'll put a rating on my spoiler review that I'm gonna put out on Sunday,0.19242066
I have a pretty good idea where it's landing amongst all of the Star Wars movies but it's giving a score to it,0.06737847
so that you guys will hold me to in the future,0.11107574
I want to hold off just a little bit until I have a second viewing,0.17645775
and if I'm being honest you need to go see this movie it is a Star Wars movie it is a good Star Wars movie it's not one of the best Star Wars movies but it's a solid addition to the franchise then we'll definitely elicit a response from you,0.07276462
and in my case I need to see it a second time before I can fully decide how I want to score this one,0.08316785
so those are my initial thoughts on the movie here's what some of you guys are saying about it,0.10371949
this was fantastic,0.10964829
I mean everything the tension the suspense the humor if I'm being completely honest after one viewing I'm slightly underwhelmed and don't get me wrong,0.07159157
I enjoyed it,0.07947366
but for me it just felt like a series of really great moments that never quite came together to form a cohesive story in a word last Jedi is unpredictable um,0.06335084
I loved it definitely go out and see it this weekend as soon as you can whoa this movie was absolutely fantastic,0.1892594
