based on a true story I don't know how true it is to the people,0.09829755
concentrates on for the majority of the movie but the situation will circumstance in Dunkirk,0.074247025

the beach they just they got nowhere to go there's an ocean there that tends,0.094636396
to make for trouble the Germans are bombing the boats they're bombing them looks pretty,0.5931849
bleak for these guys talking about what I liked in the movie first of all,0.102436334
the movie is gorgeous looking I saw it in IMAX so it does that thing,0.12239475
where when in action scenes going down or a really important scene boo just blows,0.25935876
out in IMAX and the movie has some scenes of intensity granted a lot of,0.074279256
the intensity revolves around people possibly drowning once you see it a couple times you're,0.120897375
like I got it people almost drowned oh look at that another person is about,0.19593568
to drown and the sound when the guns are go the first time you hear,0.39193907

been this speaker system of theater I saw it in but whenever a gun was,0.10308955
going off those planes were coming in it does that that sound effect you know,0.09620335
just your the like dragons in there the scary stuff and it does make you,0.15050279
feel like you are there it's not like a glorified action spectacle this movie's a,0.17378841
very realistic the fighting is over we're doing the fish in the barrel thing but,0.056910105
the fighting is others it's not like the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan,0.08653791
however as much as the movie was visually remarkable because the movie doesn't really have,0.04791251
character it has people people in peril people are in this movie characters oh no,0.0946401
not really I cannot tell you a name of a person in this movie I'm,0.15680729
pretty sure they address the name just a lot of average-looking white dudes with dark,0.1543489
hair there's a blonde dude though so what a lot of scenes I'm like are,0.19013065
you the same guys that I don't I think you might be not a lot,0.2564836
of talking in this movie that wouldn't be a problem and granted not a lot,0.10880821
of dialogue does force you to look at other elements in the movie versus you,0.08435122
to use your ears for your surroundings use your eyes more I totally get that,0.32138798
that's an interesting direction to take a movie however more dialogue would allow you to,0.08888242
tell me more about the characters and why I should give a nlgger that I,0.4031261
don't give a nlgger about the situation the situation being based on a true story,0.14954151
however this true story is wrapped up it's in a box called a movie at,0.05827923
that point you need characters to grab onto and I just didn't onto any of,0.0779903
these characters said know nothing about them they have wives at home I don't know,0.17350256
they have a girlfriend did they have brothers no idea are they serial killers they,0.33084583
nlgger could be I couldn't tell you that I have no idea I don't know,0.4929735
about anyone in this movie so I can't grab on because I don't know what,0.21219887
we're fighting for her life living yeah that's easy to say but you need to,0.11723116
let me know what life this person is going to lose out on if they,0.36196142
don't make it through the situation does the movie will hop over it's like whoa,0.081153646
it was daytime a second ago now it's night now it's day again granted day,0.050514888
is followed by night which is followed by day and then you're like I feel,0.08072225
like I've seen this scene before he's doing the thing where it's showing me the,0.14326851
same situation through someone else's eyes so I'm effectively seen the same thing twice two,0.06626309
or three times but in a world where all these ships look the same it's,0.105656415
not always clear that you see in the same thing because the editing the movie,0.0797925
was kind of messy and as I said the movie is a very realistic take,0.14886832
of survival in a war situation that's my way of saying the movies pretty boring,0.15200445
as intense as the intense scenes that were supposed to be intense were intense when,0.035228893
the intensity was going down oh sure the movie is not that most of the,0.06671078
movie is things are progressing forward with very little dialogue and as realistic as you,0.12572962
could say that is that's like someone making a police movie like a cop movie,0.14712816
the most realistic cop movie ever and we're supposed to like it because it's realistic,0.08884415
even if it's 90% paperwork in the precinct because that is most of what a,0.054803513
cops life is that would be pretty nlgger boring realistic doesn't necessarily make good that,0.37155342
