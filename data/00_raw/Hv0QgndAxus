today on the daily review i'm going to be very professional because hi film students at boston college in fm fm33901.01 fall semester american film genres monday devlin 023 5 to 5 30 i mean 3 to 5 30. hi welcome this is a supplement to your class as well as part of my infamous youtube channel with thousands and thousands and thousands of seconds of content today we're doing singing in the rain and i'm gonna be super professional about it because this is the best [ __ ] uh it's good it's a stanley doanen classic from 1952 today on the daily review with me joel larocca [Music] all right guys all right so seriously all joking aside welcome to the channel if you're new here what's up biandi one of the people i do know that watches it all right so honestly in class uh tomorrow we're going to watch the blues brothers and it's pretty fun it's pretty long so uh this is um and because last week we had labor day or whatever and we didn't have monday class so it was it was all disastrous let me get rid of hands cameras it makes very little sense right now and od is not in here if she shows up i guess i'll shut it off now too that camera's normally for my dog if you're new to the channel uh she's downstairs anyway um so normally we would have huh we would have watched uh those gels fell again that's the second it's a theme on this channel that colored gels will fall in the background and scare me anyway uh um so yeah normally we would have watched singing in the rain in class and then we would have discussed it but we didn't have it because it was labor day and so i'm kind of trying to supplement this now so i probably have sent this link to the class that's what you know all the other regular viewers want to know what's going on but anyway i love this movie singing the rain i think it's it's definitely my top five favorite comedies i think it's just so perfect and joyful and colorful and full of hope and all the things that comedies and musicals are kind of supposed to be about it's like ah the human spirit is alive and it's tap dancing on my face i love it um so i'm gonna kind of go through it more chronologically than we normally do on this channel um so it's a satire it's a musical it's a romantic comedy it's everything it's got so many things going on but it starts in a very important time in hollywood 1927. what's important about that class somebody's hand goes up maybe one of the really smart kids and they'll go well joe that's about the time the jazz singer came out talkies are about hell yeah baby so uh yeah the popularity of talking pictures starts really uh coming well not 1927 that's kind of the first big hit with the jazz singer but it's not for a few more years until all the theaters start converting but the big studios are like we gotta do this we gotta make this switch so what the overall movie is about is these two stars don lamont and lena oh no wait don lockwood and lena lamont sorry uh they're like a on-screen duo of the silent era and now they're potentially not going to make the transition very well because uh oh lena she talks like this like uh i am holly quinn and so and she's not uh the brightest bulb so she is gonna be hard to sell in the talking pictures and this is based in reality there are so many silent stars that were like king and queens of the world that could not make the transition for multiple many different reasons and then they just kind of fizzled out uh so a lot this movie's about adaptation a lot too anyway so it starts on the red carpet for the you know a lockwood lamont new movie and it's so satirical it's great about how like like uh how uh like they're there they're as happy as new newlyweds even after two weeks of marriage you know like the you know the transient nature of relationships in hollywood and how this whole movie's gonna be a behind the curtains look like that everything we're seeing is like a facade you know it's like it's [ __ ] and we know that but we still get caught up in it i still get caught up in like tabloid [ __ ] when i don't know but because that's why we like this stuff you know but in reality we know that those people are like completely different than their personas you know because they're marketing themselves as a product so then you know this woman is like you know luck would tell us about your life and it gives us like a through flashbacks that are contradictory to what he's saying which is really genius about how he made his way up and it's dignity always dignity and it's this lie about how we went to all the best schools and learn how to dance but in reality it's how he was like a vaudevillian slowly working his way up doing all these [ __ ] jobs and then was a stunt guy and then eventually uh got a roll and uh it's great because it it it's that's really like a great microcosm for what the media and hollywood is all about how it's like they project this like disney image um and it's usually far from the reality and it actually has like this really negative impact on society and we've seen kind of the zenith of that with social media where it makes people really really depressed and messes with people's heads and causes a lot of psychological problems when you think that people are living this certain life for living this thing because all you're seeing is a very you know like uh archaeologist level like dissection and pulling out just these very specific things to to show the public to make them um you know love you and not have any conflict odie wants to be enhancing never mind never mind i thought he was trying to get in the door but it's not it wasn't it was my roommate going into his room okay anyway um yeah so all that stuff is great and like i was saying social media this ends up working nicely and like still be continuing to be an issue of how the public sees um media figures and when i say media i don't just mean the movies you know and music i'm talking about like politics which has become the same thing you know especially in the trump era anyway um there's one part that i feel like is um like the the kind of like pinnacle moment of that whole sequence is that they're all the audience is all looking at lena and how beautiful she is and one woman just goes she's so refined i think i'll kill myself and that's when you realize that this movie is a beaver if this movie had to be an animal it would be a beaver because like a beaver is smart and it's cute and it's industrious but has really sharp teeth right it's social and it's kind it'll share its damn with muskrats and all sorts of stuff but it's unique and and you realize ah that this is gonna be a beaver of a movie water is just gonna roll right off its back and just put it you know and you look at like oh but it can [ __ ] take your finger off like it's still got teeth it's still sharp it's not like hey hey hollywood's great like top hat or some one of these other musicals from earlier you know maybe one of the ones you watched for your old one because it's kind of late in that in that time period uh but those earlier ones like in the code era are very watered down you know this is still in the code era but it's it's snake-like in its beaverness okay the metaphors are getting too mixed up anyway so then we go to the that's the premiere of royal rascal and that's like a big silent hit and uh at the after party uh we meet well we meet kathy sheldon that's debbie reynolds character as he's trying to get away from all this stuff and then you get they get to the after party and rf simpson who's like the big producer in the movie is like i gotta show you something and it's a talkie it's a talking picture kind of example and it's like this is the new thing jazz singer is coming out it's gonna be the big new thing uh and but uh you know we'll see maybe it won't be maybe it'll just be a fly by the night i think obviously three weeks later it's the big new thing so the movie they're working on dueling cavaliers uh is going to be transitioned into a musical so uh uh not a musical excuse me a talkie and uh wait it i spoiled it damn uh and uh so lena's gotta make the transition in one of the most famous and comical scenes uh they the quiet rolling that whole sequence of adjusting to the sound i think i've used that in like every class i've taught because it's funny it's well shot it's well acted and then on top of it it's got this great his memorable historic thing of like what it's like to have a technological change in the industry and have everybody kind of adjusting to microphones because you see it in cinema that like in the silent film era like the late silent films are doing the craziest stuff some of the craziest stuff you've ever seen like just as innovative as anything that comes out today and then the second you put sound and confined confine it to a sound stage and have to have all the prerequisites that you need for sync sound it really limits the movement of the camera and all the creativity that goes into um making a movie because now you got to get it kind of like it reset the industry for a long period of time it took a while for them to get their legs back uh no pun intended anyway uh so uh there's this relationship starting to happen there's the phony relationship between lockwood and lamont but then there's this relationship that he starts having with kathy sheldon who's like an up and coming dancer and who wants to break into the business but she's honest and she's very talented she'd be a good uh a good actress in this new world because she's a triple threat she can sing dance and act as opposed to lena lamont who's also a triple threat because she can't sing can't dance and can't act which i've always thought is really clever just like put a spin on the word threat there uh there's a great scene that really shows when they start falling in love cathy and don uh it's like in an open sound studio they go in the sound stage and they go in there and he turns on the fan and the music and the lights and i mean the fan and the smoke machine the lights and they kind of have a love scene as as they say um and it's really beautiful and it reminds me of that scene in la la land that sucks that movie's stupid and it sucks and it looks stupid and everything's cheesy it's like a [ __ ] gap commercial from the 90s i hate it i hate the characters in that movie and what they're after is so stupid and i hate la la land whoa whoa something broken him anyway after the soundstage scene is the elocution scene uh i got ahead of myself when i did the quiet rolling the elocution scene is the most fun scene in [ __ ] musical history that wrote moses supposes his noses of roses and moses supposes erroneously that whole thing is awesome and and and donald o'connor that's the other guy that's cosmo brown the piano player maybe his character is gay do you ever think about that i think about it a lot um i think that i think he is and they kind of just dance around it his oh my god his performance in that is like holy schnikes as we used to say back when anyway i was gonna say i mean chris farley was alive but uh we're gonna talk about chris farley because we're watching the [ __ ] blues brothers and you can't talk about belushi without talking about farley okay so anyway then it could that goes to the quiet rolling scene and everything the movie's gonna be a flop and that's when they come up with the idea hey let's make it a musical oh no lena can't sing let's dub her voice with kathy's and that's kind of the second plot point the first plot point being meeting kathy sheldon and realizing it's a combination of that and realizing that we're going to have to go the direction of talkies and then the second plot point is we have a way of making this our own we can do the things we know and we can use the technology right we can adapt to the technology and use dubbing so that lena can just lip sync and then kathy can actually be singing for it's you know it's pretty brilliant and obviously lena finds out and she doesn't want the crowd not because the third act is all chaos i'm not going to go into detail you should watch it uh i don't want to really spoil anything for the people who are not in the class but that idea of like lena's going to ruin kathy's career by saying fine she can play my voice but nobody knows and she has to do it forever like as opposed to it just being like a way to launch her career so uh i love it is so good and uh that image of lena lips singing and then we see that and then we see behind the stage we see kathy actually singing for her it's like just a great you know the misonsen as we say so you have to be filmic because it's a class and stuff uh you know it's this beautiful like example of what the movie's all about that it's like it that the truth is not what's being shown to the audience what's being shown to the audience is is all fabricating it's all [ __ ] it might make you feel something but it's not reality what reality is is happening behind the behind the curtain you know um which is like a complicated and beautiful metaphor and maybe i'm thinking too deeply about it to give my life meaning because i've spent so much time thinking about movies and the arts and the meaning it has for people um it's just a [ __ ] beaver of a movie dude and if you don't know what i mean watch a [ __ ] documentary about a beaver it changes its environment if it if it wants something it goes i'm going to use my skills which is non-down trees and making dams to literally change the environment and flood the forest so i can catch fish stuff like that it's literally it's crazy i don't know it's got everything and i love that idea that it's hopeful and kind and one of these documentaries i watched it's like advantageous for them to make a little compartment in their damn for muskrats because they take care of like bugs and other things like that and they like live in a symbiotic relationship and i was like oh that's just like that's like it see i'm used to i usually use the food metaphor for people to take my classes about you know kind of schlocky crap movies that hollywood pumps out a lot of times they're like candy bars they're fun to watch you eat them you're satisfied for a few minutes and whatever and you ye get some energy but then and you know it's actually killing you and rotting your teeth and ruining your organs and it's not giving you a lot of nutrition um but sometimes when you eat a big you know nice meal that has the greens and the meats and the or proteins we'll say for non-meat eaters and you know and all the vitamins and minerals you need maybe you don't like eating the brussels sprouts but it's gonna sustain you for much longer and it's gonna give you like some actual nourishment and better you um and i truly feel that way and if that sounds elitist i don't [ __ ] care i don't [ __ ] care anymore whatever find them i'm elitist about movies and stuff sorry you know whatever i don't know what to say hey let's go through the song list so there's 12 basically i might be a little bit off because there's some kind of iconic kind of medleys i guess you could call it uh songs but i just want to go through them to help people who might have to write a paper about this here's a little help these aren't the exact names but uh a fit as a fiddle and ready for love that should be fit as a fiddle and ready to ask if you want to keep the alliteration going which would be fun but that's essentially what it means and it's during that opening sequence on the red carpet during a flashback and it's like the violin vaudeville song and it's awesome oh my god they're them working together um uh i almost said fred astaire uh what what the hell's his name oh my god i am fired gene kelly jesus yeah gene kelly and uh o'connors there have just like such great chemistry and they can just like move in sync so well it's great um yeah that one that one's amazing then all i do is dream about you that's when um we meet kathy and she jumps out of the cake and she's doing like the flapper kind of dance that kind of stuff which is so fun and then and then there's the then we get our first uh uh cosmo brown song and make him laugh which looks like the most painful dance sequence next to that one the jump jive one with the uh nichols brothers or whatever they're like jumping down the stairs landing in splits this is just about as bad and so he severely he used to smoke four packs of cigarettes a day so this is really hardened and he was like in the hospital after doing this sequence and like something went wrong with the film so they had to do it again and he [ __ ] did it and it's so badass it's like jackie chan or something he's like destroying his body just to make you laugh and hopefully when you watch this in your dorm you did laugh because he [ __ ] deserves it because he did this like 80 years ago and it's still awesome and even the award-winning lotted musicals of nowadays look like a comedy joke like a satire about how to make a [ __ ] you know it looks like like we're not actually gonna dance but this would look this is roughly what it would look like if we had talent you know and this they're like throwing and he does the run up the wall in the backflip it looks like special effects and it's all real and they're not even like messing with the camera speed or anything anyway then there's the i got uh uh uh a uh i got a feeling you're foolin i gotta be you foolin what i gotta feel when you're foolin uh that's the one where it's like a kind of in uh beautiful girls is basically the scene yeah uh and it's like a fashion video video film or whatever showing how talking pictures are gonna evolve or whatever and one time i'll tell you one time when i was much younger i took magical mushrooms and don't do that but i did it i was forced at gunpoint i was much younger this is like at least 15 18 months ago and uh i watched this movie on a high resolution screen on blu-ray like this close to it and during that sequence where there's all that pink glitter in the background the guys yells to the bullhorn i was like movies are alive hey odie just entered i'll put on her camera odie going up so there you go odie's in here now you can all yay she's probably gonna make a little bed and lie down good for her okay so anyway um that one's awesome and then we talked about uh maybe we shouldn't go through all of these that may be the problem with doing psychedelic drugs is that you lose your brain a lot now i have no idea what i'm talking about okay uh life was a song you came along you were meant for me that whole seek that sequence is great that's the one on the sound stage i was talking about that's like la la land and then we go on to moses supposes which is so exuberant and then good morning that's their first of all three of them together it's so classic uh good morning that's when they realize hey wait we make it a musical um and then there's broadway melody i don't like that well i was singing in the rain obviously after that which is like the second plot point peak thing and it's like so hopeful for the future and then there's broadway melody which is another that's kind of a tangent the movie goes on i think it's probably one of the weaker parts of the movie although this movie is a 10 out of 10. that's the one part and then it's the shows like the dancing cavalier which is what the song the movie becomes uh when it becomes a musical the would you song and uh it's good that one's not super funny either this is the one like lull in the movie not that it's much of a low you know this i i to take one little point off this movie you know at some point but then they're singing the rainbow prize which is done you know whenever we reveal that kathy is doing the voice and then he sings you are my lucky star and it's good full circle because at the end they kiss in front of us singing the rain poster and then you're like is this the movie and it's like it's like inception that's great um i like when lena loman says i make more money than calvin coolidge combined that doesn't make any sense but i love it oh god make more money than cabbage school is combined uh okay so anyway that was my run through basically the plot and the songs and what i think it means i don't want to give you ad too much more because again if you have to write a paper and you just pick stanley donan which is not a bad idea or you pick musicals as a genre because we have two different kind of papers one where we focus on either a director who focused on a genre or a genre itself um you know musicals is a fun one to do because you get to see the contrast although in other ways it's not as fun because some of the movies really don't um hold up like the plots don't hold up the musical numbers are always pretty amazing but some of the plots here like or or it's like about a social um like a social what's the word like an aspect of society that's not as important like of the more rays of morals have changed i don't know whatever if i were like a teacher to college i wouldn't know but since i'm just a youtuber it doesn't matter okay here we go uh okay so if you're in the class you can now shut this off if you want uh that was the basic discussion of what i think of the movie what some of my favorite stuff is and tried to help kind of organize it for you um obviously we'll talk about it for a bit tomorrow um but we're gonna have to get right into the blues brother so uh hopefully you will watch this and i'm gonna send it out in an email today okay but now i play music and you can just leave because it has nothing to do with class um [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] dignity always dignity [Music] oh [Music] you
