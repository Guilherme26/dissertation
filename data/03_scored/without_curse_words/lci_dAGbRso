alright so I just got back from seeing this movie for a second time and,0.071705185
I just oh my god just want to sit down and just spew out my,0.24007043
thoughts and just one stream of consciousness because seriously this movie is special ok I,0.0913937
mean let's just jump right into the the plot twist at the end of the,0.1495795
film the the main revelation and the third act where we find out that all,0.08186561
these memories between Amy Adams and this little girl who eventually seems to die over,0.28261504
cancer or something like that we see these like heart heart achingly beautiful memories between,0.31089434
the two of them that are just so vivid and seriously at the in the,0.0850638
third act when Amy Adams she walks outside the giant alien ship hovering hovering in,0.15519287
the sky it sends out like a small single person pod you know Amy Adams,0.12335404
she gets in it to get sent back up to the mothership now I know,0.15081497
where brilliantly she's like covered in his gas was which I guess the gas that,0.23947677
surrounds her not only makes her levitate but uh makes her kind of be calm,0.260815
kind of a drug induced in front of the aliens you know the calm her,0.36425558
down so that when she's like she's like standing on the clouds talking to one,0.17783886
of the aliens um but you know she doesn't freak out or anything but anyways,0.17761996
when she and this giant alien or talking and essentially they've given her given her,0.24355157
the gift of being able to see into the future and then we realized that,0.05073866
this whole time okay well I saw this movie for the first time I was,0.0673422
like oh man you know it sucks that you know she had this daughter and,0.82268125
she she died and throughout the movie she keeps remembering her dead daughter that's up,0.35588008
but but like I realize that all those moments between her and her daughter took,0.15109323
place in the future they hadn't even happened yet I mean what the watching the,0.10937566
movie a second time was almost it was almost like watching the movie again for,0.06583457
the first time because I mean I had a completely different viewpoint of these memories,0.06308558
between mother and daughter oh my god I did not see that coming I mean,0.15965752
it it just totally mind me in what's interesting is that she seems to imply,0.14877579
at the end before she kisses jeremy renner and the present day that like she,0.06293176
had a flash-forward of her whole life you know cuz you know there's one flash,0.1351479
forward where you know she's written that book about the the alien languages and she's,0.11038319
at that party and that um that the chinese guy i'm not sure if he,0.18293081
was a the Chinese President or what or what but this guy he you know,0.14995094
he's talking to her about the phone call that she made it is so weird,0.25089997
oh my god ok the moment we're in the present day when Amy Adams she,0.049836937
grabs a phone and she's running through the tents and she calls this guy like,0.18746594
oh my god it's so weird because her future self did not I don't know,0.24023691
how to explain this it's almost as if like her past it's almost like the,0.10888065
future is out there happening as we speak it's already preordained right and her past,0.07513251
self is like affecting um the future self in real time like if the like,0.14017856
give her future self and events were a live stream it's almost as if like,0.10844547
her past self is you know affecting that live stream as is happening in real,0.15430357
time I don't know this is making sense but holy that just blows my mind,0.26527235
cuz her future self when that Chinese President or military guy whoever this guy when,0.26596928
he was like oh you told me my wife's last dying words you told that,0.1422648
to me over the phone it was crazy like her future self didn't even immediately,0.46414354
know what was happening her past self which was just updating her in the present,0.093007624
day oh my god I don't know someone's gonna be able to decipher what I'm,0.0975988
saying but it's what the just the way that the film deals with time paradoxes,0.038596235
from being able to see into the future like that oh my god and then,0.078965165
and there's still some things I don't fully understand like why the hell did they,0.49537387
place the the bombs inside the ships you know during this part where it explodes,0.34646142
and and jeremy renner and Amy Adams or levitated to safety which oh my god,0.11984761
that blew my mind and I just always brilliant that aliens landed all over the,0.17435847
world because it made so because I give one ship only a ride to earth,0.09906008
and landed in America you know may have been possible that the Americans could have,0.06621068
hid that ship for a long time so having multiple ships land around the world,0.08225428
makes it so that you know everyone is aware you know there's nothing to hide,0.09102249
and you know everyone is aware that they're here I'm saying so it forces the,0.056303885
world to talk together to communicate together to work together if aliens if aliens really,0.15507396
do show up that would be a great way to make us work together you,0.085931726
know Sam because they're everywhere but not just in one central location and what's crazy,0.32622033
is that you know there's like this is implied in the film but like you,0.063035876
know like through computer monitors and stuff but like in the world people are writing,0.08753202
religious people are going insane there's like protests people robbing each other's people talking about,0.713889
the military and the president people are going crazy and aliens haven't even done anything,0.69542736
they haven't they have not revealed themselves the public they arrived in spaceships that don't,0.09217783
make any sound that aren't damaging anything there's no clear signs of weapons on the,0.095318444
outside of the ships you know saying like it's it kind of blows your mind,0.36656502
because I feel like in real life our reaction to these exact same alien ships,0.18610679
would be very similar but sad because it means like what better way is it,0.08930129
for aliens to come in peace I mean my god they're in an egg-shaped ship,0.47625443
it's not like there's guns on the outside like I mean they I don't know,0.10691863
that aliens could could arrive in a more peaceful way honestly you know I just,0.11432338
thought that was so sad that humans are acting so hateful yet they came they,0.40313727
arrived in the most peaceful way plausible you know I mean and holy man that,0.07829025
plot twist just blew my mind at the end just the montage of future events,0.09145443
mesh with the present day events gave me goosebumps seriously when you see Amy Adams,0.09033956
future daughter kind of like she was skipping the way through the scene here like,0.14404914
I almost felt a tear come to my eyes because you realize that she is,0.19411826
perceiving herself having a child of the future her husband being Jeremy Renner but then,0.1853477
also she sees the whole of her life name sees our daughter dying from cancer,0.3473678
like oh my what but um I thought that the soundtrack was extraordinary extraordinary soundtrack,0.0935613
this this composer crafted it he's one my favorite composers of all time he created,0.14826776
this album right here this album literally changed my life but i'll have to get,0.0930118
i'll have to speak to that at some other time i think all the performances,0.08064892
are great even forest whitaker's Bazaarvoice which I just personally found to be fascinating I,0.114607155
don't know what accent to what was going on with for for this blue with,0.07815222
forest whitaker's voice but it was fascinating nonetheless I thought that Amy Adams and general,0.08511104
in her head great chemistry but Amy Adams carries is this film so well this,0.07282727
probably her best performance that I think I've ever seen from her seriously like and,0.13721038
there's one sequence where she was like riding on a big-ass dry erase board and,0.7444582
there's a question on there which was like what is your purpose on earth or,0.06747731
something like that Forest Whitaker was like we'll just go up there and and and,0.10336531
ask the aliens that question what's the issue and she's like well first off we,0.10206067
need to understand we need to find out we need to find out if they,0.07821705
even know what the a question is and we need to make sure that they,0.040817056
know the difference between you and your we need to find out if they even,0.16594571
know what the word what means and then we need that you know saying like,0.072865605
it was just I don't know I've never looked at it that way like if,0.06904485
we make first contact with alien so we need a community communicate with them I,0.1509155
never looked at it in such a I never looked at it like that I,0.08069678
mean it would be that complicated for real like we gotta be careful you know,0.08403163
them like I love this brilliant moment between jeremy renner and amy adams and the,0.06821231
helicopter which is the lighting the lighting in this film the cinematography is so perfect,0.0865351
it feels so natural like every scene seems to be naturally lit but anyways this,0.12618014
moment between them on the helicopter where Jeremy Renner he's just like oh well you,0.14953938
know let's ask him you know why are why are they here what do they,0.07470422
want from us how did they get here how long did take for them to,0.083484665
get here and he's just like listing off all these questions and Amy Adams is,0.07322572
just like why don't we just start with you know why would just talk to,0.07730771
them before throwing equations at them which I thought was great and just like her,0.22333094
act her acting in that scene right there like her look of disapproval when he,0.15474626
was bringing up that list of questions and then the smug look on her face,0.48014194
you know the small grin on her face after she kind of just told him,0.4976132
off you know she gives a very nuanced performance and it's is so convincing it,0.0923416
is so convincing every time she is perceiving future events and she seems to be,0.08234726
in pain and then confusion or hell even on this scene when she first sees,0.30666244
you know the first hippo pod or whatever they call those alien ships the look,0.32237232
of like what is that and then like the look of being startled and I,0.12780558
mean she was just great she was just great um again all of the cast,0.18897182
was sufficient but Amy Adams was what's the best out of the bunch I am,0.07291144
blown away by this movie I mean the first the first time I think it's,0.23992315
brilliant that we did not see the ships until she saw the ships like that,0.093309276
made the am the alien spaceship sound seemed very ominous in an eerie you know,0.11598238
when she's when she goes to class Amy Adams and they're all watching the ships,0.1522836
on TV except for us the viewer were not we're not seeing it we're just,0.057965025
saying their expressions of astonishment from what they're saying but we don't see what they,0.06557655
see that was so eerie have my imagination racing I was just like damn well,0.33446127
they look were they looking at what did what what are they saying like what,0.06666649
the you know and this shot right here honestly might become iconic one day this,0.26621532
the CGI in this film is impeccable it is my frontrunner to win Best Visual,0.07592267
Effects at the oscars there was never a time that the CGI was unconvincing the,0.056224037
CGI was always convincing I mean even on scenes were like like here where were,0.14978565
there floating into the and to the hallways like the the CGI was perfect it,0.09545784
looked perfect even when you know these two got blown back the way the lighting,0.24141183
was the way that the shadows fell on them looks so convincing holy I am,0.0981307
blown away by this movie impeccable CGI um really really immersive powerful sound design sound,0.15893817
effects and musical score the plot twist just like literally rattle my brain is very,0.15384485
is so interesting that the aliens the aliens refer to time as a weapon you,0.35888326
know the the gift of foresight that they give Amy Adams you know they consider,0.051635742
that a weapon or at least they called it that like why use the why,0.15373641
would you use the word weapon that's so weird to me oh man oh man,0.19500434
what would have happened if if you know all the nations banded together and because,0.081743605
you know when them before the explosion that the aliens has sent out a bunch,0.15759975
of symbols which formed this like weird mass of data and the computers that they,0.10815973
took that same mass of data and combine it with all the other Pods data,0.08331898
I'm not sure what would have happened but I don't know I'm trying to focus,0.10234561
on some questions that I still have about the film I know that on this,0.056976967
scene right here before Amy Adams gets in the car with Jeremy Renner she says,0.117367946
something to him but I don't remember what she said or when the Chinese President,0.16270082
or the Chinese military guy whoever this guy the last thing that his wife said,0.19149949
to him it wasn't translated like what does she say like I still have a,0.08378837
few questions maybe I'll add some more of them down below in the comments section,0.18523325
so no we're we're kind of the 15-minute mark but honestly I was blown the,0.110901356
away by this film like goosebumps inducing the smartest most emotionally powerful alien film that,0.2843305
I've that I think I've ever seen in terms of like a first contact alien,0.082702726
film for sure uh I think my favorite film of this kind has been Jodie,0.1911253
Foster's contact for the longest time but yeah this is my new favorite this is,0.02939799
like my new favorite alien film like where we first communicate with aliens like this,0.18244213
is my new favorite a holy yeah I'm feeling it tonight n it's a masterpiece,0.114797734
and I think in the future we will look back and realize that this was,0.035698205
one the smartest films about aliens ever created uh yeah I think I think that's,0.13672902
all I got I think I'm gonna dip out of here so I got some,0.14268729
other videos to make but I just I just had to give this to you,0.11245492
just an in one straight shot because I just I just needed to gush about,0.33829945
this film cuz honestly it just blew my mind it was even better the second,0.27311864
time god damn as I have lingering questions and things that uh certain things I,0.7993769
want to rewatch like that one scene with Amy Adams and Jerry Jeremy Renner on,0.13713412
that truck the cinematography was perfect the way that the ship looked in the background,0.08200404
was perfect it looked like it was actually there this moment where Amy Adams was,0.056678686
walking through the field in the way that the Sun is hitting her in the,0.16699176
way that the ship is eerily in the background I mean it looks so beautiful,0.1793556
the ship the ship looks so real out there holy this movie just blew my,0.18346162
