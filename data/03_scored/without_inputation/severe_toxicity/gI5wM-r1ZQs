what is up YouTube welcome back to my channel sabaidee Dyson I could just start,0.057021536
out by saying this is a ten out of ten instant classic just like I,0.061560087
was saying to my final trailer reaction like I loved the Irishman as far as,0.05739005
it being 3 hours and 29 minutes it does not feel like 3 hours and,0.0357789
29 minutes like you get every bit of what is going on and four 80s,0.191519
baby like myself who know who Jimmy Hoffa was know the circumstances around Jimmy Hoffa,0.045869067
this movie puts it in perspective from Frank Sheeran's point of view I love it,0.055162348
the de-aging CGI didn't bother me that much because I was just so in tune,0.03337559
with the story you know and I feel like Joe Pesci playing Russell Bufalino Bar,0.030572506
None deserves an Academy Award I love Robert De Niro ask Frank Sheeran I love,0.051581
Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa I love Harvey Keitel as Don Bruno and I just,0.028189152
feel like everyone gave a great performance but Joe Pesci is bar none the most,0.087635286
entertaining most it kept my my eyes glued to the screen every time Joe Pesci,0.06333081
talks every time he has something to say it was just like the way he,0.048522487
acted with people I love that because you would never think by looking at someone,0.10890054
like that that they're a Mafia don you know like and just the fact that,0.08691622
when I had you know what movies like these I do want to do my,0.027826628
research so when I saw Russell Bufalino as the Bufalino crime family and and here,0.080588326
is depicted as Russell Russell Bufalino like I'm not sure if he was a boss,0.033370934
but it was drawing that tell playing Bruno as the boss and Russell Bufalino was,0.02685679
just kind of like a concierge and turns out that Russell Bufalino was the one,0.11282379
that was he was the silent Donnellan he was the actual box you know I'm,0.033581797
saying I'm just kind of like God giant like dude you a piece like if,0.07070038
you have everyone you know just if you took a liking to you that he,0.027970972
protected you you look out to you one thing in particular that made me feel,0.055039957
like Dan you you you that dude was when Frank Sheeran bombed the laundry um,0.22046448
kinda like the laundry house or their like the industry with for the laundry try,0.036722127
and do that that job for that guy that was like hey you know this,0.05321469
you know it's in competition so Frank made so much money and bombed the laundry,0.10622783
Factory and then he sat down with Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci and Harvick Keitel,0.05638163
was just explaining to him like dude you know like what were you doing that,0.017591447
for who are you doing that for and you just kinda like yeah this ain't,0.032119058
the time for you to be silent like you better tell me cuz you know,0.08192402
in in in so many subtle ways he's basically saying that your life depends upon,0.076529376
it and Frank finally yeah you know the job I was doing affects your money,0.038788855
and he was just like oh yeah you know this is what I I'm sorry,0.046836246
that I did it you know I didn't mean to offend anybody you know just,0.03315142
something I did and you know Harvey Keitel is like man yeah I was a,0.050237328
silent partner and today you shouldn't did it it was unauthorized and just when he,0.042783946
was saying you know do you know how good of a friend you got in,0.018390331
Russell Bufalino and he was like friends like no you don't know and I was,0.07794223
like dang and Joe Pesci just kinda like staring at him like yeah I just,0.08885789
saved your life you know because you know Bruno is he wants your head for,0.09039846
that like you know Mike anybody else will get killed because you Russell's friend and,0.6341368
Russell delight don't do it cuz he didn't he really didn't know he got him,0.025837064
off the hook so I was just like man he was like man basically you,0.17945391
know I would have been sent you to another family you would probably got got,0.050203405
you like you know if it wasn't for him and I'm just like damn like,0.38815406
that's the pull that Russell Bufalino had and for the fact that when you fast,0.03786824
forward when JFK got shot and at that party giving Frank Sheeran their awards and,0.07752117
stuff like that and how Russell Bufalino was telling Frank Sheeran like man if you,0.11454662
can whack a president may you could definitely wack a union boss he ain't no,0.23524418
problem and you know here's Jimmy Hoffa Lima tango and dango do that like I'm,0.058368534
I'm a political figure you know Mike I'm in the media like you ain't gonna,0.054654814
do that like without having a heavy scrutiny you know like and Russell's like man,0.050460167
you don't know what we capable of you know and I just love that effect,0.04686086
because even with Joey Joey Gallo I remember watching that you know the document on,0.016162632
Joey Gallo and it was just crazy how that carried out so I'm not sure,0.08460404
if Frank was the one who really carried that hit out on crazy Joe Gallo,0.19281213
but I was really enthralled with watching that documentary about Joey Gallo and how he,0.035906613
was and I don't let that's a crazy dude boy and to say that Frank,0.20315507
got him I'm like man you were deep in the mob and crazy enough Russell,0.17069277
Bufalino I loved how they were showing that people hey this is new Angelo though,0.062428817
this is a Sally and it's showing how at the bottom of the screen it's,0.04118551
like yeah he got shot in the head eight times you know October 26 1980,0.5644675
and I might you've seen all these figure that they're running into talking to people,0.046693895
and how they're getting killed you know after the event you know and Russell died,0.43850997
which is very rare for mob boss to die of natural causes basically he lived,0.18629599
out his whole life not getting assassinated not getting contract killed nothing so you knew,0.32247943
that this dude was cool with every other Don that was in America probably even,0.05894392
in Sicily nobody won in his head he didn't he didn't crossover nobody's toes even,0.107793674
crossover but nobody's fingers and if he had to do a contract kill it was,0.41010937
for a reason like because he that I do to be like man look you,0.054243065
know we could talk things out but if you can't do that he meant business,0.029307326
too that is major respect that was probably before the Philly mob had carmine the,0.031098666
snake I forgot his last name but I really like I said I love mob,0.047130257
movies I love mob documentaries but this was all before carmine the snake came in,0.10906817
to Philly and made Philly a dangerous place to be fusing ma you know and,0.20718741
like I said I run that Jimmy Hoffa time there's there's a lot of speculation,0.03589996
to the theory of Frank sharing with a lot of other theories that who killed,0.35774937
Jimmy Hoffa but with this this put me at ease to know what happened to,0.02816321
Jimmy Hoffa this looks this looks and sounds a little bit more believable because who,0.08530647
else would have got really close to Jimmy Hoffa but at the same time when,0.01753025
I looked at the documents for Jimmy Hoffa they never once mentioned and Frank Sheeran,0.024443503
next to him many photos so I don't know how true or believable I feel,0.052573454
like this is but it feels very believable just by the I heard you pay,0.018728245
houses I love that I love that slogan I love the book I haven't read,0.056657016
it but I love it makes this makes me want to read it to understand,0.06552458
what else they were doing around that time a revolving around Frank Sharon's life and,0.08226792
it just shows how huge is a hardened criminal and it made his daughters kind,0.28518102
of look at him differently and you could tell that he was so into the,0.01948855
life that his his kids were like I can't you know I have no relationship,0.15397339
with you because he's a cold-hearted killer you know and Frank knew that Frank knew,0.27826965
that that's why I'm just like to live out his life the way he did,0.07318217
he knew that the whole time right you know I'm like he just was in,0.039208584
the life that's just what that's what it does to you you know it's just,0.029198902
like being in the war and as he mentioned frequently endless like it's just like,0.05743129
being that war it's like you know this is what it is so I loved,0.14522223
every minute of it this is like I said an instant classic I'm definitely gonna,0.06275409
check this out again whenever it's like a year or two three years down the,0.032710407
road this is going to be instant classic and if in his shock just like,0.052427113
Goodfellas and away you know and that's why I was like him somebody's getting the,0.042408783
wars for this Netflix got him one finally cuz then he plus was like yeah,0.08839825
we you know we only tell Netflix got them one with this definitely like I,0.014726501
said ten out of ten I love the performances I love the dialogue it's a,0.049022038
slow burn dialogue and I missed that and movies where it's not a lot of,0.04379303
action you don't need it you just need to pay attention to the dialogue into,0.029238813
the story like you have to pay attention to understand the next scene I've missed,0.02418009
that in movies and this movie carried it out to perfection awesome tacular if you're,0.048495214
Jeremy Jones fan Chris tuck me a plus five out of five wolves if you,0.25876996
