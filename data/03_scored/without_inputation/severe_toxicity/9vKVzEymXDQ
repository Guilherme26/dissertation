there that's 8th grade the movie there's a little bit okay so because I know,0.09110555
you've all been waiting for it this is my review of a crate so I,0.062436134
I know a lot now uh people been asking for this review but there's a,0.03579752
few interesting reasons why I thought well first of all I apologize because this is,0.022517132
one I did have a screener for like I could have saw I could have,0.037741188
seen it early but uh there's two reasons why not well one is that I,0.025306912
I think I was working that day or something like that but then the other,0.027898468
thing was you know I saw the trailer for this movie and I said you,0.05096238
know this looks good it kind of looks like I feel like I know what,0.03594586
this movie's gonna be though and we'll kind of get to that in a bit,0.090705104
it's one of the reasons why I'm doing this review so this is very much,0.035052516
truth in advertising uh this is definitely a movie about eighth grade or rather the,0.026944594
last week of eighth grade I should say but but it's very much that that,0.023669895
age of being around eighth grade and a lot of people's enjoyment of this movie,0.048712064
is going to come from how they enjoyed eighth grade and my guess is there's,0.04510943
uh there's three people they're gonna have a certain there's three main responses that I,0.022298286
think three people three responses that this film is going to get what its gonna,0.03684452
be people that see it is just it was the point of that nothing happened,0.040223654
screw it which I get there's not many twists and turns or anything like that,0.257638
in the movie by I mean watching the trailer I think you could figure out,0.030666297
that that's not the kind of movie it is there's others that's gonna see it,0.038910583
for kind of the awkward strange confused but very important time in you know a,0.038391072
child's life that will very much impact them as they become adults very much about,0.1208193
closing one door and opening another and they will say man this really connects with,0.021595187
me like this is so honest so truthful and this just really really holds a,0.026610006
deep place in my heart and then there's the third kind which a lot of,0.048402753
people have told me they don't want to see this movie for this very same,0.05387256
reason which is that they've gone through eighth grade and it wasn't fun that age,0.046121173
is an awkward age and it's uncomfortable and it's not something that a lot of,0.048690114
people want to relive I'm kind of one of those people and that's the reason,0.04599745
I kind of wasn't interested in seeing this movie because I said I'm sure this,0.043344032
is done well but I don't look it's specifically that Graem that's like the exact,0.02164175
grade I really don't like because we moved around a lot when I was a,0.029633932
kid because my dad was in the Navy and so like he kind of it,0.08675924
kind depended where we were if I fit in well or I didn't fit in,0.036243197
well if I was popular I was not popular and 8th grade was just like,0.021126233
just when we moved to a new place it from a place that we've loved,0.030016411
and we moved to a new place that we did love and we just have,0.023536857
we were all kind of miserable there we just we did not fit in or,0.23102568
at least I didn't fit in to the new school I was given to so,0.02638717
given to but then when high school started and you know things got better I,0.02300338
got to know people better and stuff like that but eighth grade was not a,0.019116713
happy time for me and this is a movie that is not it's not like,0.02889225
a miserable movie or anything it's not like welcome to the dollhouse but it is,0.15422083
a movie that definitely very well taps into the insecurities of that age and if,0.032474265
I'm guessing correctly again I'm not an eighth grader but it seems like it's connecting,0.038957812
it very well to like today's technology to the way kids talk now which I,0.029473621
don't think it's too different from you know like when I was growing up but,0.028984047
the but definitely the technological angle and the social media and and the putting videos,0.028479837
online and stuff like that and finding kind of different outlets for what you're going,0.041003916
through so I knew a lot of people I have a lot of friends they,0.034485117
were saying like well I don't want to see that movie cuz I hated eighth,0.08465726
grade I've knowed a lot of people that that said that so and they weren't,0.048825145
interested but I had this one friend who was telling me over and over you,0.032584686
gotta see this movie and on top of that Rotten Tomatoes was just praising the,0.15098804
hell out of him even had this thing this is why you should ignore the,0.1809825
are rating on eighth grade and I know if they're talking about I mean it's,0.035887323
like it's it's are for a good reason I mean don't get me wrong but,0.02906653
I mean it's like I can't remember they say that many swear words and there's,0.024818001
a see if they do talk about like sexual stuff you know easy freighters talking,0.29593766
about sexual stuff I think there's even a scene where like a woman's holding like,0.3552679
a dildo or something like that you're like yeah if an instruction no so so,0.5299475
this is very much this is very much kind of letting people out there who,0.049248867
aren't abating whether or not to see this movie like trying to help them figure,0.02784126
out what kind of movie this is you know is this something they would like,0.04145358
if some people say it's very depressing other people will say is very inspiring a,0.08526124
lot of people say it's both and my opinion is both but it's it's kind,0.044014536
of exactly what I thought it was gonna be so if you're looking at this,0.035149634
trailer and you're saying man that looks like a lot of uncomfortable awkwardness you know,0.064234786
and sort of like kids that you know are trying to figure things out but,0.05646345
talk like they had things figure down they're gonna embarrass themselves but it's also part,0.10984111
of growing up and they're not gonna be liked by a lot of other kids,0.11063334
or they're gonna be ignored but then they're also gonna be liked by a couple,0.046952654
other kids and they have a sweet moment with like you know me the parents,0.04272275
and stuff it's that kind of movie but it's not done like I don't know,0.043961987
like American Beauty or something where there's like clearly a three-act structure where this thing,0.08589383
that happened the beginning is gonna happen at the end there's a lot of things,0.036064927
that technically don't go anywhere there's a lot of stuff where like she'll meet a,0.039688848
new character and have a very unique scene with that character and then just you,0.0326093
never see that character again there's kind of stuff like that and and it's good,0.022489859
that's like that cuz a lot of a lot of film is very much building,0.032710407
up this very current you know time and place and personality and who you are,0.048116058
there's even like a weird thing where she like puts away a memory box like,0.084160365
from sixth grade and they opened in eighth grade it's like what is that something,0.036994852
that like only two years but but that's something a lot of it is you,0.03774851
know sort of like it's taking these steps and Serve going into you know the,0.03297382
next step you know it's it because you're going through tough stuff doesn't mean you,0.028706001
give up on it there's a lot of good things and yes a lot of,0.025547042
it I related to you know I think because we have moved around a lot,0.027269868
there's a lot of times where you know I I was kind of everything I,0.03592391
was the popular kid I was the total loser I you know ashamed to say,0.2244489
I made fun of kids but I was also made fun of at you know,0.105597906
some points it's one of those things where it's like depending on where I was,0.013400124
and how well I fit in you know that they were different experiences but that's,0.030333705
also part of growing up so I think it's also one of those things where,0.015786804
if you look at this I like let's say you say it's greats the best,0.05485836
time of your life let's just say you were the school jock you know we're,0.10270103
a sports team and you did awesome everybody loved you and stuff you still gotta,0.027894476
have something awkward like everybody goes through something awkward I think everybody can find something,0.067358494
in this that they can relate to in terms of like that confusion or even,0.00840393
if you were super successful you know at that age you may think I got,0.028717974
everything figured out and and of course you don't but but a lot of people,0.05269119
have a age you know I think they do have a lot of stuff figured,0.023632644
out or more things than they're aware of and this movie very cleverly ties that,0.041484177
in with her kind of video v logs that maybe two or three people watch,0.04542406
I mean nobody even watches them but she puts him out there to kind of,0.10739656
figure her own stuff out very clearly and one of the things I like most,0.0803309
is that the editing in this is very good is if she's invite to this,0.031055428
party that this girl has ever already made very clear does not want her at,0.18949153
the party is only inviting her because I think I think it's her mother because,0.08764992
she's like what's your name again it's kind of weird but um but but she,0.08776367
forces her to invited to this party and she does a v-log saying like you,0.04276266
know I I was having this party and my dad want me to invite this,0.043489706
friend and I didn't want to but I did anyway and you know when I,0.023788298
met up with her though I found out she was actually really nice and really,0.038611248
kind and I'm glad that you know he made me invite that person over so,0.039686188
she's clearly changing things too you know almost play it out how she wants it,0.02700313
to happen in her mind and they're playing this video while she's walking up to,0.07822959
the door of the party which is very clever because again it really taps into,0.027782725
kind of what the mindset is at that age where you're kind of playing in,0.05052868
what will happen what you want to happen you know hopefully making it what you,0.05032979
think will happen and you know if that's kind of what's going through your mind,0.08972596
and me very much taps into like you know this person that has kind of,0.055840172
social anxiety and she's not I like it because the the kid does not seem,0.10478771
like your stereotypical geek you know in a lot of these movies like the geeks,0.22587687
are making fun of super super all the time and it's just really you know,0.029556105
just constant and this kid just seems like a normal shy kid who wants an,0.078322046
identity and she's still trying to figure out her identity and the videos are kind,0.09922345
of her hobby in figuring it out but it's also not like it's clearly a,0.045768626
journal even though the videos are set up to like give advice and I also,0.012537382
like that there's kind of little victories in this like her going up and singing,0.077305645
karaoke at the party which you never hear her sing which again is very clever,0.057759225
uh is a victory to her to a point where it doesn't matter how she,0.08380516
sounds and nobody boos nobody rolls their eyes and obey or anything like that she,0.10898901
sings and that's it and a lot of the time the movie the reactions of,0.023051275
the other characters it's not as much about that as much as her reaction how,0.023943285
she feels about it there's this scene near the end where she finally tells off,0.09736626
I guess not really a bully but she very much you know let somebody know,0.18142152
how she feels about something she does the whole thing without looking up at them,0.08917984
I mean I get very clever and we don't see how the kids really react,0.067427
we see a little bit while she's talking but when she walks away she just,0.08201249
gets this little smile and it's like it's it's not she told the person off,0.10576686
in a really great way it was super odd and awkward and uncomfortable but she,0.07738879
was proud of it so it's it very much sort of hits those little victories,0.13633138
and I will say it does not end on again kind of like welcome to,0.038840737
the dollhouse a park Imperial a lot so that it doesn't really end on a,0.04039527
note like that you know when I operate it back to that again when I,0.030917736
first saw welcome to the dollhouse which s where this is now review of uh,0.029373845
I didn't really get I didn't see the point of it I'm like okay we're,0.021183439
just seeing a person get made fun of for a couple hours why is that,0.03947532
interesting why is that fun or anything and when I got a little older I,0.03827334
appreciate it a little bit more but it's still not really my thing I have,0.06920371
an appreciation for it but I don't really like it but I get why other,0.037214365
people enjoy it and I do get the comedy of it too and I admire,0.10409858
the harshness of it but with this film I feel like it's it's not quite,0.03912876
doing that it's just combining enough a new stuff with having this kid can be,0.07999964
someone that can disappear but it's not like you know what the hell's that drew,0.31078953
Barrymore comedy was it never been kissed or whatever where it's like in high school,0.07616419
I just disappeared and nobody noticed me yet nobody noticed Drew Barrymore weird no it's,0.07289748
not like you know just kind of a typical teen comedy I mean it's done,0.100377545
with a lot of heart and a lot of thought and watching this even though,0.019062167
hobbies I grew up a boy I'm watching this I'm saying okay well I recognize,0.06823387
that feeling I recognize that moment I recognize but something like that happened but I,0.020997187
also recognize the nice moments too so very much the reason I want to do,0.0300663
this review is anyone that's like if you see this movie and your thing it's,0.07433959
either gonna be all a downer or it's gonna be super sappy about and uplifting,0.05481113
and stuff uh it's something kind of in-between and ultimately ends on a positive note,0.040774427
but it is I'll even say half and half I'll say 70% of doubt or,0.016865732
70% a anxious uncomfortable awkward you know that's probably better way of putting it because,0.03280686
I mean there there's a lot of movies about childhood are much more aggressive and,0.041616548
this is not an aggressive movie this is very much focusing on sort of the,0.030215302
awkward stuff that can happen and how it can impact a person without necessarily having,0.064599976
to spell it out to you it can just sort of show what they're going,0.04563692
through when she goes to this party for example you know she she has this,0.037610814
one-piece suit and nobody else there is wearing a one-piece and it's something where it's,0.065120816
like she never says that she never mentions it but but you notice it it's,0.030515965
like oh well like all the other girls are wearing like bikinis and stuff like,0.24313043
that and she you know does not have you know the body's like what they,0.08266836
have in stuff is a clearly a different friend group but then like when they're,0.026300697
taking the picture you know taking the picture of all the girls together and they're,0.09541261
all game together and they say oh we can't see you you know main character,0.035395753
we can't see you come to the front and you're thinking like well Kay they're,0.029101785
gonna do the thing where everyone rolls their eyes or they push her off and,0.24678443
they play some sort of mean trick and then she turns into Kari and zaps,0.15791394
everybody no but you know what I mean like does some sir a mean trick,0.05230073
and they don't I mean they just let her be a part of the picture,0.059754778
okay whatever they they don't really like her but you know it's they're trying to,0.043941367
be more realistic like that's what people would do they just love being the picture,0.051600955
and be like whatever you know and that's kind of the feel it's like most,0.019820478
of it feels very legit very realistic there's one or two moments where they don't,0.016664846
sometimes the father does something like after he drops her off in them all he,0.19794136
does something that I thought was very odd and kind of out of character even,0.028652785
for him you know there there's another weird scene where like this this boy is,0.06743299
driving this girl home and I mean you can see it's coming a mile away,0.19800389
but he obviously tries to hit on her and tries to get with her and,0.060865633
the way he does it even for eighth grade actually think it's 8th grade I,0.029574065
think it's like ninth grade this kid is very odd and I don't know that,0.060943462
felt very like the way was done when it was very very strange but you,0.058123082
know it didn't seem like yeah that's that age like now that's just weird um,0.0460041
but you know once in a while they'll do a shtick that's like oh it's,0.119570084
that stick way like I've seen this in a comedy but it feels mostly pretty,0.079230025
genuine and when somebody actually does want to hang out with her or she actually,0.14591934
does get a friend that's really cool and she's super anxious and she practices how,0.03640816
to say hello and stuff you feel good that she actually like is connecting with,0.04318173
someone and then you feel just as bad when you know something really uncomfortable happens,0.031188466
and again a lot of it is kind of done through the performance and done,0.018843323
through you know just the various ways that they show what this person is going,0.03602568
through you know visually so yeah I guess what I'm trying to get across is,0.015726937
that this is a very genuine movie it feels very much like eighth grade and,0.021599177
even if you were super popular in eighth grade like everyone can find something in,0.04262763
this movie they can be like yeah I went through that yeah that's something I,0.041885283
can relate to but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get into the movie you either,0.008238965
say you want more twists and turns or a more traditional story or you'll say,0.027135503
that this is a little too real and I just that's not something I'm interested,0.020289432
in seeing for me I'm glad I saw it uh I don't know if I'd,0.050315157
see it again for all the people that were saying like yes this just a,0.033493992
movie that shows the genuine awkwardness of eighth grade yeah this and it does it,0.03128026
well but it isn't 100% downer it does bring up some positive things as and,0.011870203
you know genuine joyous stuff but like I said it's 70% awkward uncomfortable you know,0.035602625
stuff that maybe you'll really connect with um I think it's no reason really one,0.037236314
to talk about because it is a movie where I feel like there'll be a,0.020933995
lot of people there just like this is not the movie for me and I,0.044170856
I would kind of be in that category I just be like I remember eighth,0.021338426
grade fine hey you know I don't need I'm not someone that likes to go,0.075580165
back and watch all home movies of myself or anything like that I don't like,0.04126001
remembering how awkward I was and I acknowledge it I know I was but it's,0.08146305
one of those things where I'm just like I don't like reliving it um but,0.018806072
a movie like this very much can sort of take that feeling it can say,0.032337237
it's okay to you know everyone went through this you know everyone went through sort,0.072531626
of these different stages of awkwardness at that age you know that's really that age,0.030817958
and for some people maybe they forgot about it and this kind of brings it,0.027621085
back and it's very much about moving forward and you know again there are some,0.011151804
clever things even though I don't know why it was two years that that time,0.041119657
capsule memory box or whatever you know it's very much about that happen now you,0.054360136
know moving forward to the next step and they they do that in a very,0.029601337
clever way so this movie is a shot very clever it's edited very clever that,0.092495784
the sound design as well with where they put the audio of like her videos,0.06848731
explaining stuff and what she says and why and and so forth is really good,0.03074612
when she's upset when they have it go quiet you know maybe you have her,0.037120573
talk or just certain songs or whatever I mean it's stuff that you definitely recognize,0.034107957
and I'm glad it doesn't take place in the 80s or the 90s I mean,0.039854478
don't get me wrong I when something like that comes out it's like cool that's,0.06414499
when I grew up but it's really everywhere right now and I think if you're,0.016849767
gonna do something with that it's fine people want to do something with that but,0.03075144
they really have to have more to it you know just a coming-of-age story in,0.030976271
the blank decade it is getting a little old like you really really have to,0.11319297
put a different spin on it which I think people can do and are doing,0.03354521
but we're seeing a lot of kind of just ooh references the 80s the 90s,0.012446917
or whatever so I'm hoping that people kind of wake up more that there has,0.034692653
to be more to it than that and there is a lot to this and,0.020413822
like I said the fact that it's set now and it does address technology and,0.019451965
sort of the different hobbies that people have I mean people are on there they're,0.04879854
on their phones a lot you know in this and they're on their laptops and,0.016300324
everything you know I feel like it's there's gonna be a large peep a large,0.05305571
amount of people that really do connect with this movie and so I kind of,0.07530544
wanna make that clear to that is this is a very very good movie it's,0.046952654
a very very well-done movie and if you're looking at this and you say I,0.036237873
really want to relive what eighth grade is like or experience what eighth grade was,0.028574293
like this gets several elements even it's not exactly your childhood it gets several strong,0.07809256
elements of it but there are going to be people that just don't have an,0.029286705
interest in that I'm a me for me the stuff I like to I know,0.06005145
what's ironic the guy that plays in this now a critic but the stuff I,0.03351129
like to relive is you know things like movies and shows maybe see a toy,0.057564992
I grew up with or something like that or a place or an environment I,0.036193974
like seeing that because that sort of brings back a lot of emotions and a,0.026347259
