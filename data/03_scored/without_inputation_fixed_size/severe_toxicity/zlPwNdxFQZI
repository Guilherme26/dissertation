to listen to the soundtrack on for over a year it felt like I'd crossed,0.034783784
over into a circle of hell just during a preview before this movie hey that,0.27781135
movie chick here and today reviewing Koko and apparently also Olaf's frozen adventure I mean,0.16046558
fine the Olaf Shore is harmless it's stuffed with more songs than quest for Camelot,0.054624215
but harmless nonetheless just kind of wish it wasn't in front of the movie I,0.07021878
was about to watch although it did make it all the more apparent how good,0.029486926
Coco is it's a surprisingly dark and gothic yet heartwarming and sweet tale about what,0.07152454
it is to diverge on a different path separated from everyone else but to never,0.017003424
forget about those who have loved you and stood by you the title even symbolizes,0.022424005
to never take for granted or discard the memories of those who have passed on,0.020737765
and to never turn away those who still remain with you the story Falls Miguel,0.049107183
a young kid who dreams of being musician much to the chagrin of his family,0.07191434
who believed music had cursed them all and will only bring misery and shame to,0.68013155
their lineage desperate to prove himself as a true musician at a local competition Miguel,0.030589135
steals a guitar from the grave of famed singer ernesto de la cruz however in,0.30405676
a weird twist of fate miguel cruises himself to the afterlife now he must receive,0.066693306
a blessing from his family to re-enter the land of the living before the Sun,0.07272719
sets and he's stuck there for eternity the cast here is great there's not like,0.06359023
one bad apple in the bunch the kid who even plays Miguel usually when I,0.054385416
see this in a kid's movie they're whiny and bratty and very self-centered and just,0.42602435
kind of are rude to everyone but in this movie he's so sweet and good-natured,0.10242232
and he just wants to be himself and to love music and his family at,0.017400539
the same time he's a hopeless dreamer who feels in the end conflicted with the,0.07968102
strong wishes of his very controlling family especially the stubborn matriarch Abuelita if the movie,0.15384966
wanted me to hate her with every fiber of my being then mission accomplished oh,0.4145636
my god she was dreadful all her blind heating music because she was told to,0.16439615
and never fully understanding why or even questioning it just killed me I understand having,0.28687376
a strong sense of tradition and loyalty for your family but when you are asked,0.010847815
to enforce something so ludicrous you just got open your eyes you know my final,0.28630704
straw was when she destroyed something not only held dearly to Miguel's heart but something,0.09503944
that he made himself I legit almost cried when I saw the grief-stricken look on,0.045470625
Miguel's face it was more traumatic than the King Triton scene from the Little Mermaid,0.058191597
now most of this movie is spent in the afterlife and that's where the amazing,0.051786542
imagery comes in that had left me absolutely awestruck the attention to detail the use,0.03870238
of colour just simply gorgeous this is where we meet the rest of Miguel's family,0.047893222
who have been long since deceased mainly we focus on mama Imelda where the family,0.13148752
curse originated from at first I thought she was gonna come off as a black,0.67959917
character and merely just an obstacle for Miguel to face but really you end up,0.043314762
sympathizing her and really understanding how she came to hate music and that's the great,0.13478416
thing about this film the longer this film goes on more and more layers are,0.02476279
added you'll learn a lot about the characters and nothing is ever simply painted as,0.009983076
black and white and not everyone is as they seem Hector the Forgotten ghost and,0.12420376
he's definitely one of my favorites here at first he appears to be a trickster,0.23323724
and very roguish but really by the end I'm like crying tears of joy to,0.052699175
this guy it has revealed very very gradually how different he actually is and how,0.055290066
much heart he has you end up really feeling for him in his dilemma also,0.03640284
I still can't believe that Benjamin Bratt was in this movie he plays the deceased,0.0801247
singer de la Cruz even though it wasn't his voice singing all the parts I,0.35748345
was still thoroughly impressed that I couldn't recognize him speaking of singing the songs are,0.029091807
not too bad either and that's coming from someone who's not a huge fan of,0.038135644
musicals for one the songs feel out of place and they had a purpose and,0.036946297
meaning behind them they weren't just merely cluck and when you learn the true meaning,0.08234175
behind the lyrics towards the end it just ends up becoming even more heartwarming and,0.029502224
this film definitely gets you a little bit misty-eyed especially by the end I found,0.23744498
myself caring for the characters and rooting for them there's also a pretty good twist,0.015345122
for a kids movie that I didn't really see coming at first that happens in,0.037572235
the third act there's actually quite a few fresh twists and turns in the story,0.016783914
that kind of makes it difficult to thoroughly discuss without giving anything away and I,0.031663407
really would prefer not to give anything away for this movie I really think that,0.042054906
people should support it and go out and see it although can I say I,0.059648346
was not expecting this movie to be as dark and open about death as it,0.3069758
was they did not hold back and I applaud them for that I think it's,0.039364904
important to show children the meaning of death and that it is not something to,0.0890029
fear and that it is simply a part of life and it doesn't mean that,0.033813946
someone is gone because your memories of them still exist also there was a lot,0.09032795
of skeletal mat dismemberment in this movie til like a very gory degree if there,0.08435726
were blood it kind of gave looked like a Tim Burton - style to it,0.24392666
but without being as bleak and sarcastic oh and can I say the dog Dante,0.04989742
it all he did was make me miss my dog more who still back in,0.07441077
Jersey I wasn't able to take him with me on my trip he is currently,0.12013949
living with my parents and he's basically Dante just - the really long tongue I,0.02937451
kind of made me wish I had a another dog right now my place isn't,0.058415096
allowed pets so my only real complaint is the end they tie up the loose,0.10098685
ends a little too neatly and most of them off-screen also there was no retribution,0.046303432
for how cruel Miguel's grandmother was to him like she did some awful things to,0.110753745
him and they just kind of brush it off and it's I realized that's kind,0.0856424
of realistic especially with this type of family but I don't know I was kind,0.054687407
of hoping like to see some sort of groveling I mean I'm sorry I I,0.20892887
know there's tough love but then there's also being a stubborn asshat regardless I really,0.6208739
dug this movie I went through so many emotions my heart and throat felt sore,0.07896195
from trying not to cry during this film it probably didn't help that I am,0.023901379
spending my first Thanksgiving without my family so watching this movie really brought out those,0.038893953
fields however this movie did teach me it's okay to follow your dreams like I,0.13835487
did moving here to California as long as you never forget your family and those,0.06672856
who love you this is a genuine family film with a bit of a gothic,0.04940984
side and showcases a beautiful culture that should be taught and embraced by all ages,0.060282268
and yes well it has a similar premise to book of life it shares a,0.025524426
bare-bones likeness at best and sorry to say but Coco did it better in my,0.0948645
