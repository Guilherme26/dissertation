hey what's going on out there YouTube this is SEL zero three two zero representing,0.10796968
JVs unfortunately I will not be watching any of you guys as livestream comments I'm,0.22839239
just going to be getting straight to the point because I want to be able,0.16677773
to articulate what I really feel about Wonder Woman after reflecting on everything I saw,0.15519913
last night after the review after the discussions after it was all said and done,0.04629208
you know from my critical side from my critic side what did I truly think,0.101171345
about you know one woman because I think that it's so easy to get lost,0.34516168
in the sauce with you know being excited having a decent movie to having something,0.09294895
that actually works and then having your friends be there to really enjoy it with,0.11863675
you it's hard to sit there and critique something in that nature so this will,0.13327792
be my finite number review as well as my ultimate perspective on Wonder Woman that,0.13008112
I saw last night alright so here we go um looking at Wonder Woman in,0.14187217
the way that I would dissect it I think that it's a very well-done origin,0.1490966
story for one woman based on her mythos based on her character development and I,0.11388976
think that even from a written standpoint I think it was written very well I,0.09887654
think they took a lot of time engaging where they wanted to go with the,0.02614616
character and it wasn't like necessarily tied down to anything with the DCU in any,0.09428552
regard of what they were able to do before it I think that the other,0.076829135
thing about this that I actually really appreciate it is how the fact that when,0.06436619
they actually did commit to the somber moments or the sad moments that they were,0.0790094
able to push through them they not that they lingered on like you know this,0.1981519
doom and gloom kind of situation but when there was something serious that was actually,0.13793486
happening they stuck to their guns and actually did it very well I think the,0.15293849
other part of this is that um when I was looking at the film I,0.045076314
think that man-ho you guys you sorry I'm on my breakfast right now so for,0.17263542
me I think they were able to commit to those somber moments very well like,0.15214188
when there was moments of you know like man that was a weighty scene they,0.15076475
committed to it and I think that the credit goes to for me is definitely,0.06277918
in street Trevor character it was played by Chris Pine he committed to every single,0.042451423
every single line every single moment like he was the character actually rally behind even,0.08360221
just as much as I did for Diana Prince played by God to died but,0.16021091
when he had these moments of like this charismatic character this brave character he acted,0.11267458
them very well towards the third eye I think that he had one of the,0.09078512
strongest pushes to push her into who she need to be as Diana Prince as,0.24256955
Wonder Woman and moving forward and again this is going to be a non-spoiler review,0.08075566
um I now going through a lot of the positives I think that the score,0.09550796
was very well done they they did such a great job with the score that,0.04093272
I was really surprised that I was like I really want to buy the score,0.04515535
um I think that the set pieces where they went from London to the muscaria,0.1798137
that was I mean even if I compare it to you know Thor Thor the,0.058476023
dark world like this this rivaled that in so many different ways I think that,0.1537909
they did a really great job committing to how they wanted to showcase you know,0.07305761
the Amazonians and the scare I think that there there was some negative stand points,0.15419938
I think there were some moments where I wanted to go more in depth with,0.05908248
the lore of the Amazonians I think they could have went more in depth with,0.056824774
it but I think what they gave us was enough for be like alright I'm,0.0692159
hooked in when you make another Wonder Woman - which I'm guarantee at this point,0.091873646
they're going to I know that I'm gonna see more I know I'm gonna see,0.062814735
more history more richness of where things are going to go and at the same,0.05338701
time there's so much intriguing mystery that you don't know everything you know moving forward,0.08875871
and I think that that makes for a really good origin story as well but,0.057234127
at the same time I think that critically you know I could have been given,0.056123555
a little bit more I could have been like okay was this character pivotal so,0.08859144
I think even like you know Robin Wright's character is amazed easing as her character,0.037299357
actually wasn't this I didn't know much about her you know but from from a,0.07534747
compass and I know you know I think that they did a really good job,0.061284143
with her and with the mother but I think I would have benefited from seeing,0.079070464
so maybe some flashbacks I think that definitely would have worked a lot better in,0.06253608
terms of the film um the third act okay so for me I didn't have,0.060770597
a real problem third that I actually appreciated the fights you know the weight of,0.11880995
it in the way they ended I think it ended perfectly in a lot of,0.097964056
different ways from a superhero standpoint but I think that there were some moments where,0.03086628
I was like okay Wonder Woman you know what are you doing like you know,0.17253083
like okay this is I understand your perspective on it but I don't know and,0.14815499
I think that that could be kind of a negative critique but at the same,0.08742891
time the way the gal gadot character portrayed one woman her you know her vigour,0.22874889
her light everything about her represented this person that was new to the world that,0.13515738
understood right from wrong they had a lot of book knowledge but didn't have any,0.08057121
life experience as much as you know she's been around or Amazonians she has not,0.16520646
known what it means to see somebody suffer she's not known what it means to,0.3426481
see you know somebody weaker than her but at the same as that time have,0.18008631
as much life as her and I think that when you think of somebody has,0.08456901
a lesser being and not necessarily I'm not saying she did but just when she,0.15057252
was raised versus what she sees she used she was a lot of growth there's,0.068808556
a lot of character growth in this film for her that gal gadot displayed very,0.08260058
well like when she starts actually utilizing her powers I was like this is better,0.08095544
than you know when Henry Cavill was portraying you know in men still like the,0.08405209
evolution of his powers and he got it so quickly but this one was way,0.10107554
more believable in terms of her as an amazonian at the same time even more,0.06485547
so when she starts stepping into the fold as Wonder Woman I think that they,0.13218465
did a really good job taking the time with that and I think it's going,0.080545604
to pay off in the long term because a lot of people their critiques what,0.15938361
man still was that this happens here this happens here this doesn't make no sense,0.15397955
while he do this I mean this is a person that you know within a,0.10259551
day it became ed and super me and he had no experience like you know,0.20840825
they hadn't had experience she had fighting experience she has wisdom taught to her in,0.114845
a different way strategically you know but at the same is that time she's never,0.092992015
gone through anything and I think that they were able to unfold that in this,0.11644393
film so eloquently well um but what else can i really say without spoiling anything,0.17425254
and I don't want to ask any questions I really want to just articulate my,0.08183247
thoughts in a conducive way as to not fanboy out because the geek in me,0.27623743
I love the film I really enjoyed the film I gave the film initially a,0.0090662725
9.5 rating I must say this okay and I can't give this film anything less,0.1114927
than a 9 out of 10 I'll say that from a record like this is,0.07002209
uh this is all my my critical side this is on me as a critic,0.15325005
I can only drop one point off of a ten only because I don't know,0.16701823
any more negatives to actually go off on this I really legit don't um I,0.12813449
did not watch it in IMAX 3d I did not watch it in 3d at,0.09219981
all I just watched it as the film as is and it was a really,0.03497963
done well film I think that from the way that they paced it from the,0.06766676
way that they processed it the progression of it I think some people are gonna,0.087767676
be like this drives on a little too long but there was never a moment,0.07220644
that I didn't enjoy it what I mean by that is there's committed comedic relief,0.09876487
there is actual leaf there somber relief there's moments of just the quiet moments there's,0.050676744
moment where you literally see her in the mascara just looking out into the distance,0.13156001
and you're picturing your head like what's going on through your head but it's way,0.43960086
done so much better than you know some of the other superior feels like not,0.1175909
even DC Universe like some other superior friends that I was kind of like go,0.1315916
there for you know like they went there with it with her and I think,0.07917748
that they paid so much on watch not just to a superhero character but from,0.047077235
the first in my opinion best female superhero movie they've ever done I mean when,0.1963022
we gun compared to we got a super girl we got Catwoman and got electric,0.50833845
all of them technically we had two heroes versus Supergirl but this was one of,0.1508735
the best superhero films that I had seen I think I'd actually make comparison to,0.059460912
this one to spider-man 1 and Batman Begins in terms of superhero origin lore but,0.097817406
as far as it being a film critically actually assessed this was a well-done film,0.08159634
this distance period it is is a really good job with it was fun it,0.07318283
was entertaining I can take my mom to see it I could take my you,0.19295321
know my wife to see it I could go take a little kid to go,0.21514432
see it and specifically you know females like this caters to the female demographic not,0.46716103
just female empowerment but at the same time the preservation of life in and of,0.36099568
itself that was you know brought forth from women like they even addressed that in,0.35608712
the very early parts of some flashbacks of what you know the Amazonians and women,0.14089821
in general did for mankind and I think that the way that they portrayed Steve,0.06731824
Trevor in the way that he you know respects Diana as much as follows and,0.021322096
rallies behind her and when it's time for him to move he moves no matter,0.31089434
what he's brave he's endearing and he's respectful of her which I've not seen that,0.14002119
honestly and certain characters um and as I said like I don't have any real,0.114283495
big negatives I think that um the villains I don't think I didn't talk about,0.099669024
I'm not gonna not gonna go in there I think that there were some weak,0.18862051
moments towards the middle um but they were self-sufficient I don't think that they came,0.09847891
off kind of not cartoonish in the very beginning stages when I was kinda like,0.07911346
huh you know and that falls into that - one that I would say but,0.07812757
towards the end it all it all ultimately paid off and I actually really enjoyed,0.1559164
what they did for Wonder Woman I recommend you definitely go and check it out,0.15391359
for yourself don't go into this with a lot of high expectations like as much,0.1267274
as I you know nerd it out yesterday and enjoyed the film and I keep,0.24219082
doubt I legitimately did geek out um I would say go into it with low,0.23993047
expectations go into it trying to have a fun time take your daughter take your,0.3265692
mom go into it with somebody that's a fan of the superhero Laura are not,0.08252383
even just DC Lord just going there to see a good action pad fun superhero,0.05727007
film and I promise you you're gonna enjoy yourself you might rate it you know,0.17885722
a seven out of 10 you might ready to eight out of ten my rating,0.24003848
a ten out of ten but I promise you one thing that you're going to,0.13356753
actually appreciate and enjoy the way that they crafted this super your film and yes,0.08505928
this was written and helped by Zack Snyder and Geoff Johns and patty Jenkins did,0.090148814
direct the mess out of this film but as much as that they did a,0.15188296
great job um Chris Pine gal gadot stole the show for me personally and then,0.26265395
there were some other notable people as far as even their team their team was,0.0711451
really dope I just really personally thought that they did a really good job as,0.105810106
a film critic with this film and I give it a 9 out of 10,0.074343875
again if you didn't hear me before I can't get anything less than that I,0.101189524
was thinking about maybe as much as I could bash it or you know go,0.34570825
back and forth but even when I was comparing it to like man still man,0.18305051
still still is one of my favorite you know DCU films period you know um,0.09928955
but this either one equals and rivals it or is better let's just just flat,0.11705605
out but anyway my breakfast time is over I sacrifice my breakfast time to be,0.31089434
able to give you guys a critical retrospective on Wonder Woman and that's what I,0.11011256
have to say about it if you have anything more definitely go and see me,0.15843879
ran and kick out about one a woman again the soundtrack was amazing the score,0.47115207
was amazing the acting was done well was it perfect there are most definitely some,0.040212065
cheesy moments there were some moments towards the third act I was kind of like,0.0712646
this is unnecessary this doesn't make sense but at the same time sincerity of the,0.059411675
character one woman and what they were to bring to light for the character it,0.078716986
was represented very well and me basically knowing the Lord and being movie critic I,0.05566713
really could appreciate and rally behind Wonder Woman and I definitely will be seeing it,0.11232125
again if possible I'll try to see it on the 30th with that press screening,0.06777374

rivals that if not it's better as far as action I'll say that off the,0.07441475
off the gate if not the action this maybe pacifically better all right you guys,0.10104766
