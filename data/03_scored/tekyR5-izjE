[Applause] hey guys I've got a new review for you and this one is for,0.07639069
a pretty major awards contender this year Greta Gerwig solo feature directorial debut ladybird stars,0.076746844
Saoirse Ronan as Christine who now goes by the name ladybird she is finishing up,0.18798499
high school at a Catholic school in Sacramento and she is really eager to get,0.0936045
out of town and into college all the way on the East Coast far far,0.0780626
away from home the movie isn't based on girl wigs life but she has said,0.18431915
that the movie does contain certain ideas that have truth to her and you can,0.0906371
really feel it while you're watching the movie it works especially well with the way,0.10398118
that Lady Bird looks at Sacramento I personally didn't experience exactly this when choosing where,0.0979811
to go to college but I do very much understand and connect to the thought,0.054796867
that something special is out there and it's somewhere that you're not and that intense,0.19720288
pulling you might have towards it I did have that feeling a little while moving,0.11773437
to LA and girl work really captures that idea and feeling so beautifully in a,0.109752655
way that both well represents ladybirds current disdain for her hometown but also while conveying,0.15170184
what makes it a special place and that's a balance that's really important throughout the,0.050728608
entire film and then of course there's Saoirse Ronan performance and she is just something,0.115730576
else from Hanna to Brooklyn to this and so much more her range is incredible,0.053350605
and so is her ability to wholly become a character by the end of this,0.11425175
Lady Bird truly felt like a person I knew and I enjoyed getting to know,0.17312272
and that speaks to both how well-rounded the character is and also how well Gerwig,0.055729195
establishes the highs and lows of growing up how one moment one thing can seem,0.06802958
like the most important thing in the world but next it's not but then also,0.09093547
how all of that is deeply connected when it comes to who you become there,0.048991263
are so many key moments for Lady Bird in this movie and some do get,0.09025178
more screen time than others but all of them resonate and really mean something personal,0.10810029
favorites though include her relationship with Lucas hedges character Danny someone she falls for while,0.07584537
doing a play and also with beanie Feldstein who plays Julie her best friend but,0.05936862
while I might have liked those connections most the portions of the film that focus,0.046701785
on Timothy shall amaze eyal another guy who catches ladybirds eye and the queen bee,0.31089434
of the popular crowd Jenna played by O'Day Arush they're just as important because ultimately,0.05278558
you're a product of all your experiences and relationships and that's something that Lady Bird,0.25333184
highlights especially well but where it finds even more success with that concept though is,0.024886651
through ladybirds relationship with her mother played by Laurie Metcalf Gerwig penned the script here,0.30516234
as well and she nails the mother-daughter dynamic Metcalf and Ronan are so flawless in,0.2647893
their heated back and forth and also when they get those abrupt shifts of getting,0.09534925
over one issue and moving on to something else they disagree a good deal in,0.06430637
the movie but the love is always there kind of like it's always underneath the,0.08947731
surface and it gets to shine through every now and then but no matter what,0.09766631
you always feel it Metcalfe and Ronan really are fantastic but I also have to,0.13069238
mention Tracy Letts as ladybirds father they have a really beautiful connection that winds up,0.19176847
serving is a really effective assist to what's going on between Lady Bird and her,0.16240296
mother I'm gonna give ladybird four and a half Dewey's out of five on the,0.30878857
Dewey Decimal scale this is just a really special one and perhaps it's extra special,0.08933963
to me as someone who finds some similarities and ladybirds experience and also deeply values,0.1130772
my relationship with my mother but now that I've seen it I also do understand,0.15726598
why there's such widespread love for this movie it's fun touching a great mix of,0.1532924
comedy heart and nostalgia ladybirds journey is delightful and deeply moving for her and in,0.103005745
the end it also challenges you to consider who you've become and why and the,0.06538548
first thought I had walking out of the theater is just how grateful I was,0.09124945
that I got to experience this movie with my mom so there's my review of,0.19205081
Lady Bird but now I want to know your thoughts did you see it did,0.15289077
