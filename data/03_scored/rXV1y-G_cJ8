either guys how are you so before we dive into the movie review of get,0.080529176
out I first want to talk about a very sensitive subject racism because in one,0.2896982
way or another this one we does deal with racism and I want to give,0.37839887
you my quick thoughts on the subject in life people are people there's a lot,0.14926518
of cool people that you meet along the way that come in every shape in,0.1894898
color and there's a lot of nlgger heads that you meet along the way that,0.5611698
come in every shape and color and to wrap up my thoughts my motto is,0.14166027
people are like Sour Patch Kids they come in every color but no matter what,0.4031439
they're all delicious did I just compare sour patch kids to racism at six o'clock,0.46675524
in the morning let's talk about the movie get out a black guy meets his,0.63105655
white girlfriend's creepy and mysterious family the movie get out as a horror mystery thriller,0.55018336
so spent with a heavy dose of comedy and going into this movie I had,0.15365662
no idea how heavy-handed this movie was with a comedy throughout and at times it,0.11349072
is very subtle and I appreciate very subtle comedy because in my opinion that makes,0.09884815
things even funnier letting the film get out there's very intense serious situations where one,0.048511423
of the characters just makes an offhanded comment that's funny that relates and makes sense,0.052193888
during the situation but you as an audience laugh at it because it adds a,0.102941334
certain level of levity and I liked that about this movie but as far as,0.18005012
comedy goes the main characters best friend named rod is pretty much the main comedic,0.09163833
relief of the movie and there's three or four scenes where he references crazy white,0.4438723
people kidnapping them eating their heads and using them as sex slaves and I was,0.8060606
like yeah I that's funny so like I said before the main plot of this,0.10572463
movie is a white girlfriend takes her black boyfriend home to meet her white parents,0.37971318
and everyone in this family is very eccentric very weird and creepy and you just,0.43703154
get this vibe that something bad is looming it's a very suspenseful film I was,0.13595293
really on the edge of my seat at times wondering what's going to happen how's,0.06903287
this all going to turn out and along the way you're laughing at the sad,0.15037306
tires and the stereotypes that the movie is making fun of when it comes to,0.05642879
the writing of this film I thought the most clever thing it did was you'd,0.17101473
expect all these white old crusty people to be racist no one comes across truly,0.7231966
racist in this film yes they do stereotype things but no one really makes a,0.40318254
ray this remark the white family in the film actually goes so far as to,0.19171484
say that black people are genetically gifted and they're almost envious of that and when,0.66413325
it came to that approach I was actually surprised by that because I was expecting,0.07223372
a very cliched we're old white people we don't like black people and I thought,0.6466581
by flipping things around and making them envious of them for certain reasons which I,0.34415677
can't spoil I was like yeah that's pretty clever I like that two thumbs up,0.1676875
and I guess when it comes down to I'm just glad there's something slightly original,0.090419725
still left in Hollywood and this movie is a breath of fresh air it blends,0.086263575
a lot of different elements together to give you something unique and something that you,0.1135403
haven't quite seen before but still giving you the things that you want to see,0.0801203
in a film especially a horror film the thriller aspect the suspense with the sad,0.0872444
tire in the comedy it's all these great things blended together to make an entertaining,0.124146685
movie is it perfect no so let's talk about that for the first three forces,0.08220334
movie I was really on the edge of my seat I was buying into the,0.056771517
hype the suspense the build-up I enjoyed the characters in the story and I was,0.02735051
really getting hyped for the climax of the movie and maybe it's because I've seen,0.12315881
one too many movies in my life but just judging by the trailers of this,0.05962725
movie I essentially guessed how the movie would end and it's not like I guess,0.08844698
every single detail of the ending of the film but the general outcome just watching,0.048621003
the trailers I could watch those and be like yeah it's probably going to go,0.07634975
this direction and it does and is that necessarily a bad thing no but I,0.07575972
was just hoping that the movie might have a twist to where you couldn't guess,0.076395825
just watching the trailer like I said the first three fourths of the movie are,0.06851878
very clever I really enjoyed the build up but once you get the payoff to,0.08114919
everything I thought it came across a little bit silly it sort of has this,0.4031776
made-for-tv sci-fi channel vibe going on I thought I got a little bit too convoluted,0.31089434
for its own good and I almost feel like the movie took too much of,0.066210605
a physical approach to the ending of the film I thought if it was more,0.0529792
of a psychological approach with everything being inside of your head I thought that would,0.4437211
have been a little bit more interesting and believable as far as action goes I,0.08982401
thought the main actor who played Chris the main character of the film did a,0.046372894
great job with playing this very subtle down-to-earth guy who is just he felt like,0.18402117
a dude in this weird situation and I couldn't help but think hey if I,0.113773875
was just this guy in this situation that's probably the same kind of things I,0.077172965
would be doing too now my final flicking thoughts of the movie get out at,0.08568594
times this is a funny comedy satire film at other times it's a very creepy,0.2719366
thriller suspense aurifil and the biggest praise I can get this move is it blends,0.15208553
all those different genres together to give you something new and original and it's also,0.07631572
entertaining but as far as the overall writing and directing go I liked it this,0.07794039
movie's self-aware at times I like the Kombi aspect of it but one of my,0.09031121
favorite things about this movie is throughout this movie there's so many little intricate details,0.065041445
that characters and sayings and events that happen that don't make any sense until the,0.09698823
final conclusion of the film and I absolutely love when a movie gives you a,0.07766728
payoff like that to where all these little minor plot details finally add up into,0.10832751
something bigger and this is by far the best horror film I've seen on the,0.09540745
theatres of 2017 yeah so I'm going to give get out and the more I,0.11334021
