I want to be a little reserved and I don't like to get my hopes,0.08146637
up because disappointment always sucks especially with big movies I'm excited for and the DC,0.5036819

great one one that I want to watch over and over and over that's a,0.041695707
breath I've been holding since 2013 Wonder Woman is the first really really legitimately good,0.04205025
DC EU movie despite all of the hate that went her way when she got,0.13109705
cast gal gadot owns the role of Wonder Woman she reminded me of Christopher Reeve,0.03142926
in the first Superman movie full of joy hope and completely without cynicism this is,0.11087281
a fantastic casting choice she really nailed this role this movie was a total blast,0.079636455
from start to finish it has a lot of the things that I want to,0.042768646
see in a superhero movie it's extremely funny Chris Pine has amazing chemistry with gal,0.039694835
gadot and there's two fish-out-of-water stories in this movie the first act is Chris Pine,0.03950326
in this place and he's like I don't get any of this and everything is,0.035008617
surprising to him and he's learning a lot about Diana and her upbringing and then,0.09537669
we have another fish out of the water story and that's Diana going away from,0.015383037
her homeland and learning about the real world and what's going on there and world,0.032340564
war one and so we get to see two characters who sort of teach each,0.105101675
other things which I was really happy about because I didn't want to just go,0.026681181
to this movie and see a perfect character with no flaws from the very beginning,0.034798417
she has a lot to learn she's very naive and the film was wise to,0.070994385
understand that and it allows you to go on this journey with her and feel,0.040955357
like you're experiencing all of her ups and downs emotionally it's not just like she's,0.08180428
born she's a perfect fighter she's a superhero nobody can touch her she's not a,0.20817986
Mary Sue that term that describes someone who's just perfect at everything a lot of,0.043614097
people complain about ray in the force awakens that this very self-sufficient character that had,0.03131352
virtually no flaws that's very much so not the case in Wonder Woman this isn't,0.03075144
just about empowerment like this perfect person who hates men and doesn't like men and,0.3291338
men suck it's actually a very equal movie which is something I was really excited,0.67562366
about because I really didn't want to watch another Ghostbusters movie where the entire time,0.026057905
I'm just reminded about how horrible I am because I'm a man this actually it's,0.071688175
very much so the opposite of that which brings me to Chris Pine their chemistry,0.038484864
is amazing they both learn from each other and their relationship in the film went,0.017134465
to emotional Heights that I did not expect and I was genuinely touched by the,0.037458487
end of the film I was really into that aspect of the movie which was,0.04108307
a major surprise and I found myself really caring but he brings a lot to,0.019137334
the movie he's not just some guy that she's constantly saving because he's some weak,0.1540439
guy like he actually brings quite a bit to her character and her to him,0.058192927
they both really learn from each other and there's a lot of times in the,0.03696758
movie where patty Jenkins and the screenwriter they took the time to have smaller moments,0.058047917
there's a scene where he teaches her how to dance and it really means a,0.05093644
lot for their characters but it's also the type of quiet small moment you don't,0.015146897
normally get in movies like this and it makes their relationship so much more fleshed,0.032047216
out and there's a lot of scenes like that I won't get into any spoilers,0.045159984
but there's a lot of times where the movie does slow down and lets these,0.045262422
characters just be people it's not just a mindless series of action scenes there's quite,0.06905604
a bit of action in it and when the action is going down my god,0.089038156
it's satisfying there's a lot of tiny action moments but there's like three major set,0.021355055
pieces in each act there's an incredible sequence on her homeland an amazing world war,0.23704797
one sequence and of course the big epic finale that finale did get a little,0.03615938
CGI heavy and it reminded me of some of the doomsday stuff in the end,0.02530292
of VBS for some people that might be a turn-off but here I thought it,0.22173299
was handled considerably better in regards to the way it was all cut together there,0.017881466
is a lot of CGI and that's to be expected because Wonder Woman is not,0.07123452
normal so that kind of shit's going to happen but since I actually cared about,0.52512914
the characters this time around I didn't mind as much when it got CGI heavy,0.034355406
my biggest gripe with Wonder Woman is pretty much the same one I've had with,0.06265298
most superhero movies as of late whether it's Marvel or DC and that's the villain,0.0569936
characters they're pretty weak there's like two or three in this movie and some of,0.04799832
them are just so poorly underdeveloped and they feel very hammy which doesn't really fit,0.18226631
in with the rest of the movie and that was a major disappointment for me,0.045923613
the movie is really long but I think it works for this character you really,0.030577827
needed to see her upbringing her roots where she came from why she is the,0.17982242
way she is it wasn't just a bunch of padded scenes and they also wisely,0.06412769
understood which elements of her origin to poke fun at which things sounded silly enough,0.36918107
to make a joke out of it and so it wasn't just it was kind,0.039219227
of like the way they did it with for like Thor has some really silly,0.15294434
and cheesy origins and they found ways to poke fun at it and make it,0.17735192
entertaining enough so that you could at least get a joke out of it I,0.06792789
talked about it briefly but some of the action scenes are genuinely epic like the,0.015418292
very definition of epic the score is also really exciting and I'm looking forward to,0.021220023
buying it all in all Wonder Woman is pretty much exactly what I would want,0.07333783
out of a Wonder Woman movie I am so happy to say that this is,0.044136263
the first great DC EU movie and I had a blast with it the villain,0.23328924
characters could be better this isn't like the best DC movie since the Dark Knight,0.011509008
I would say The Dark Knight Rises is probably still a better film but this,0.017540893
is a blast it's really fun also colorful this is a really colorful movie it's,0.051135328
not be saturated and depressing there's a ton of colors in almost every scene which,0.08426147
oh my god just colors people they really matter I'm going to give Wonder Woman,0.07453981
