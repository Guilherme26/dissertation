bit later towards the end of the year so let's get into the film so,0.09578079
mouse Morales who is voiced by shameik Moore who you know from dope and Shaolin,0.45732436
fantastic from the get down so essentially he voices Miles Morales who is his young,0.15454485
teen he's a so um Latino and so basically he's going through a tough time,0.22363104
because he's feeling caught in between two different worlds as his Paris wants him to,0.09216927
go to this really bougie boarding school and so after just trying to rebell in,0.14940166
for a night he gets caught up with to a little song something and I'm,0.10073594
not gonna give it away cuz I'm gonna get the plot away to you guys,0.16063297
in case you don't know what is going on with this movie but essentially Myles,0.110995315
has to save the world okay because some stuff got messed up and not only,0.11757814
do we have Myles who is spider-man okay we have 15 million different spider people,0.18500835
running around because there's different timelines that have been impacted and all these different spire,0.059982963
people come together to defeat this evil threat it's okay and that's all I'm gonna,0.3221177
say so let's go ahead and get into what I liked about this film first,0.095306255
and foremost can we get on this soundtrack because when the music started playing there,0.048102606
was a certain song that was clear I was like oh so yeah really going,0.08037999
there like yeah really gonna do this with him music I really enjoyed this music,0.1016345
I'm definitely buffing this soundtrack when it comes out and I need to check it,0.07451376
out yes I can go ahead and start buffing this on the way to work,0.10489746
tomorrow but I love the music for this film I'm also to the animation what,0.07331732
I love about animated films and why this makes the most perfect spider-man movie the,0.17849912
bed spider-man movie out of all the spider-man movies it's just that there's no limit,0.18856114
to what you can do with animation as far as what spider-man can and cannot,0.18548298
do and so I have to say the animation is so top-notch that you truly,0.09768911
feel like you're watching a comic book literally I felt like I was going through,0.15533963
frame by frame by frame of reading a comic book and I was just like,0.08017214
wow you guys did a very great job hood says even from where Mouse is,0.055109523
talking to himself you see the little the boxes that you would see if you,0.114666894
were reading the comic to hear his inner thoughts and I just thought it was,0.07736898
so great even with the noises you see just how they perfectly drew this film,0.09877884
and turning into this animated film it was so beautifully well done it as I,0.14878358
said in my intro this movie has already been nominated for a Golden Globe I,0.13837647
truly believe that it has what it takes to take best animated films for the,0.072563
Golden Globes and to also earn an Oscar nomination and to actually win in that,0.043570656
category also - I didn't know all these people was in this you had should,0.07895387
make more who was playing Miles Morales then you had we had Jake Johnson who,0.08240394
was playing Peter B Parker you had zoe kravitz in this you had Chris Pine,0.0809136
in this Oscar Isaac Liev Schreiber I was just like dang how much are these,0.18174107
people to be in this movie because yeah I was just jamming yeah so John's,0.115791
gonna come for everybody's thoughts what everybody's voicing these characters in this film and I,0.0991889
love that the focus still remains on miles I have to say that was a,0.05179891
little weird because I was just like yeah kind of changing it up a little,0.10527555
bit especially with throwing so many different characters from different you know from different Spider,0.1508019
versus into the mix I really felt that for a moment I was worried that,0.061932877
the attention was gonna be taken away from Miles but I'm happy to say that,0.06854367
it wasn't we got to see a lot of his interactions with his family on,0.11893455
personal things that he was going through with his family betraying relationships with his father,0.16257277
and then also to relationships between him and his uncle who was voiced by my,0.1576542
Hershel I'll eat another I was like wow that you hair Brian Harry tyrita was,0.24929832
voicing his father I was just like y'all did that but to see the relationship,0.08989063
from the bottom between a black a young black man in his black father and,0.18687156
also to with the Latino aspect I thought it was so amazing to watch and,0.10301723
one of my favorite scenes of this movie is this scene where Merrill's is kind,0.0907005
of walking from school from home to his new school and kind of this code-switching,0.094819404
thing that he goes through and he's going through kind of like talking in slang,0.19065101
with his friends and then also to going through I'm him speaking Spanish as well,0.053703222
and so I thought that was so freaking cool I mean I also had a,0.24129482
chance to interview more at the Lennon red carpet premiere which I want to be,0.08067911
posting an interview after this video he actually I'm learning Spanish from The Voice coaches,0.06812751
and it was really important to make sure that they brought in Miles his culture,0.059632584
I'm from being afro Latino and I thought it was great to see on screen,0.40920356
I really loved this movie yah I'm not gonna give too much away about this,0.09045608
I love this film it was so freakin good and make sure y'all stay to,0.50167674

different ones and I was like that was cute you guys did a really great,0.11267487
job with that so much of a great job but I was just like why,0.06689087
couldn't you put this effort this energy into all the other spider-man movies that you,0.18724304
made so far I'm just wondering like what was y'all doing this whole time because,0.08746766
this this right here this is which I should have been doing for everything else,0.08896704
okay so let's be happy there Marvel got back the right kind of has it,0.113711715
