I've been seeing way too many good movies lately,0.10242882
I feel like I need to watch some bad ones to balance it out,0.113000795
you know I'm not complaining about all the good movies but I feel like my sample pools a little skewed your ghosts let the most is not so slowly becoming one of my favorite directors the lobster blew me away two years ago and ever since I've just been inhaling his work which is why I went and saw the favorite at the New York Film Festival which was its US premiere,0.14788584
now technically,0.04610932
I didn't see the US premiere that showing was at 6:30,0.062380098
and there was a Q&A with your ghost lamp the most and I think Emma Stone was there I cut a smaller showing with no QA about half an hour later,0.17058915
so technically I saw the second u.s. showing of this film and Wow for a period piece,0.089216225
I can already tell this film is gonna sweep the technical categories production design costume design hair and makeup all that good stuff,0.105353594
it's not just that they were impressive period sets and period costumes because I've kind of come to expect that a proper period piece will already have those I'm probably taking it for granted,0.06350607
but that's just an expectation of mine at this point,0.06777746
but there are so many little things that cater to the absurd nature of the film stuff like eggplant earrings,0.24102129
you know it's all these all these small things that really pushes the film above and beyond typical period piece attire and the sets aside from being impressive Palace sets have such a McCobb Eicher to them which is kind of ironic because the film wasn't nearly as dark as I expected it to be not that I was disappointed by that looking at his last three films the lobster is kind of a balance between seriously dark and comedic Lee dark the killing of a sacred deer has dark comedy but it's mostly serious,0.08562942
and then on the other end of the spectrum this film is a comedy not in a bad way though not that the tension is broken by the comedy,0.15507504
it's more like phantom thread where it uses comedy to convey,0.111287996
it's heavier more serious themes and the tension in this film is still incredibly powerful,0.067793064
I don't know how lanthum OHS does it year after year,0.11727001
he's been in such command of the films,0.19772844
he's released his direction is top-notch,0.07233397
this film is a little different,0.09728683
he's toned down the monotone delivery which I realize is an ironic but what I mean is the actors convey a lot more emotion in their their dialogue and their mannerisms than in lanthum OSes previous films that said it's still very much a your ghost lanthum of film it's still jam-packed with idiosyncrasies,0.30746722
and I think this film is actually a great example of the difference between a quirky film and an idiosyncratic film quirky,0.112976424
I think is more of an aesthetic term where is idiosyncratic implies that there is a meaning or theme hidden under all these small things looking at Wes Anderson for instance he's kind of a mixed bag of quirks and idiosyncrasies,0.17356099
but I think LAN themost is mostly idiosyncratic although I'd argued that the dialogue in the killing of a sacred deer is quirkier than it is idiosyncratic and just to be clear,0.15977558
there's nothing wrong,0.06903743
with quirkiness,0.15285929
I don't want this to become a thing where like pretentious people use idiosyncratic and only normies use quirky like I don't watch movies I watch films no they're just very similar words with slightly different meanings moving past that digression,0.18801613
let the Moe's approach this film with an aesthetic affinity for extremes,0.1247387
there are shots with extremely open exposure the highlights just dominating the frame he uses these crazy wide-angle lenses some of which are so extreme,0.36867398
you can see both ends of a hallway or a road within the same frame and sometimes he uses these crazy wide-angle lenses and opens the exposure up at the same time,0.3393726
the title design pushes the centering of text to its extreme,0.046215698
there are even shots that are really dark and have extreme noise that however I found to be a little distracting and I probably would have preferred if you used a little more light,0.114576556
and those scenes that said it didn't happen that often and mostly the shots were astonishing even the editing is extreme,0.08360471
we have these extreme J&L cuts cuts that begin before the scene is over or carry,0.059648808
on after the next scene has begun there,0.05498186
were scenes in this film that we hear the audio for as early as the previous scene begins the film is broken up into chapters,0.03738349
and the first chapter has a very clear first act structure this whole first act they're just setting up dominoes,0.08197775
and as soon as the first chapter ends and we see the title card for the second chapter it's like they put this elaborate domino setup into motion,0.04710666
and we see the rivalry but I'm a stone and raychel wisest characters develop and play out,0.04813991
I will say that the third act of this film could have been a bit shorter,0.14933275
they they dragged out some of the events just a little too much,0.09625195
that said I was having such a good time watching this movie that I didn't even mind all that much,0.10689526
the very last shot of this movie layers,0.1526279
so many different images over each other,0.073550545
I feel like the word trippy is probably selling it kind of short,0.12528694
there's so much information the film is giving us letting us ponder the conclusion of the film it's it's amazing,0.037866976
this is really a perfect companion piece to bury London which also criticizes 18th century English royalty naturally the sets and costumes have a lot of similarities,0.14391539
but where Barry Lyndon tried to recreate the era as authentically as possible and have chastised well characters within this authentic setting the favorite in addition to a lot of authenticity portrays this era in a sort of heightened reality layering on a decent amount of absurdism,0.15074436
there's a scene where Rachel Liza's character Sarah is dancing with some guy,0.10924469
I don't remember if it was Nicholas Hoult or not and the way the dance is framed and lens,0.080763794
and the actual choreography of the dance itself is so ridiculous,0.70337415
it's like your ghost lanthum oz is physically standing,0.33328062
there laughing in the face of 18th century royalty,0.14540668
so needless to say this film is far less subtle than Barry,0.23542751
Lyndon not that that's a bad thing,0.12972158
they're just different ways of approaching the subject matter,0.09603758
there's even a scene in this movie that almost directly recreates the recital scene from Barry London the three best performances this year are all in this movie I thought I'm a stone was pretty good in la-la land,0.06641864
I didn't think her role was very demanding nor her character all that complex,0.07818906
she did as much as she could with it,0.09384779
but this is the performance that makes her worthy of being an Academy Award winner,0.05871257
she's she's incredible here as is rachel wise and Olivia Colman does such an amazing job taking a character that could very easily be a caricature and breathing so much humanity into her not only are these the three strongest performances,0.1534073
but also the three strongest characters I've seen this year,0.035506476
they're each so dynamic on their own,0.090680234
but as a three-person group the dynamics among each other are so richly layered and complex,0.15156156
I haven't seen a pair of characters as diametrically opposed as Abigail and Sarah since there will be blood probably just such a strong understanding of who these people are by everyone working on the film so these two are certainly strong characters opposing each other,0.08242236
and then we have Olivia Coleman's character Queen Anne who's in the middle and she's really more of a vehicle or even more,0.15259928
so a MacGuffin for these two to fight over that said it's totally unclear which of any of the three of these people are the main character and probably has the most screen time,0.15087566
but it's Abigail and Sarah who were battling for her and even then they have equal screen time and development naturally,0.06945485
I'd say we want to view Sarah as the protagonist and Abigail is the antagonist but none of these characters are good or bad the film starts out and Sarah's being ruthlessly mean to Anne meanwhile we see Abigail is thrown in the mud she's jerked off - we see her sleeping on the,0.3254434
ground,0.07165285
she burns her hand she's got this messed-up backstory so immediately we have these associations with the characters but then we see how much of Sarah's rudeness is out of love and we see just how conniving Abigail can be but not all of Sarah's behaviors out of love she's equally as conniving as Abigail and we totally see where abigail is coming from going into this situation,0.24973129
so there's a lot of moral ambiguity going on which as you probably know I have a weakness for I can't help but love a good morally ambiguous story as I mentioned each of these characters is acted to perfection I almost feel bad for Nicholas Hoult because he's got a great character,0.07212974
and he gives a good performance but he's so out staged by the main three that it's easy to forget he's even in the movie at first,0.088461965
I was surprised to find that this was a Fox Searchlight film and not a 24 considering,0.16688725
it's your go slant the most and then I found out that your go slant the most didn't write the script for this film which was even more surprising because he's always written his own scripts but even more surprising than that is who the screenwriters are believe me when I tell you that this is the strongest script of the year stronger even than probably any film that came out last year and it was written by two people named Deborah Davis,0.11664204
and Toni McNamara,0.04479059
this is Davis's only IMDB credit and it looks like McNamara was mostly just a staff writer on some not very popular TV shows he also wrote and directed an Australian film called the rage and placid lake which received mixed reviews as well as a film called Ashby which received less than stellar reviews who are these people and how did they write such a phenomenal script,0.052348148
and if they are well-known people then how come I didn't know about them,0.13236432
and how come this is Davis's only IMDB credit it makes no sense it doesn't add up,0.07177068
I can't,0.05564296
I can't wrap my mind around it,0.15125227
the script is too good for nobodies to have written it doesn't make sense not only is the character writing in this film god-tier,0.10404125
but it's endlessly quotable there's a scene where this guy walks into a begins room and she asks him are you here to seduce me or rape me and he goes,0.8355208
I'm a gentleman,0.063002385
and she goes,0.07634443
so rape it is then that's the kind of humor that's persistent throughout the whole film it's so fresh and biting and there are,0.665314
so many great one-liners like that despite,0.10235233
the fact that Lant the most didn't write this script,0.11583479
I totally understand why he chose to direct it,0.05818192
it's thematically consistent with his other films and here I'm gonna get into a few spoilers so if you don't want to hear go to this time,0.21264388
so in the end abigail becomes a lady and Sarah's exiled from England and their final interaction totally changes the way we view this whole dispute Sarah's about to leave and she says to Abigail you really think you've won and Abigail says something like half an eye and Sarah says we're playing very different games,0.1294619
now at first I thought this meant that Sarah had some plan to win back ends affection and somehow defeat Abigail,0.07615953
but then I realized that no more had to be done,0.09181249
I watched the last shot his Abigail is rubbing Anne's legs and their faces are juxtaposed on top of each other as the shots of rabbits layer and layer,0.37023675
and then the movie ends my very initial reaction was oh it's over,0.093591735
but as the credits rolled the image suddenly made sense or maybe not the image,0.06627579
but the ending I realized that that moment was the film's logical conclusion Abigail thought she had won because she was now a lady,0.081630364
and thus untouchable was that really what the battle was over what now now that she's a lady keep faking love for the Queen,0.36906508
sara has that whole monologue about how she tells Anne when she looks like a badger because she loves her and Anne realizes now that Sarah's been exiled that she must up she lost her love and now she's stuck with Abigail who she now realizes has been using her this whole time and Abigail knows that Anne knows,0.29125443
and now they're stuck in this awkward relationship the rabbits serving as a constant reminder of Abigail's fake love,0.16520703
and this is the game that Sarah was talking about and really Sarah won because she's still the one that Queen Anne loves and Abigail may be a lady now but that doesn't mean anything other than a better bed to sleep in better clothes to wear and better food to eat which is heartbreaking,0.11416772
but you realize that Abigail put herself in this position by using the Queen and it's just such a beautiful conclusion juggling,0.10133807
so many different contradictory feelings the direction and performances are great in this movie but it's really the script above everything else that impressed me here's my prediction and there are many films I haven't seen yet this year this film is gonna win best production design and best costume design your ghost lanthum host will be nominated for Best Director,0.040888056
Robbie Ryan will be nominated for Best Cinematography the film will be nominated for best hair and makeup and best film editing nicholas hoult will be nominated for Best Supporting Actor any of these three actresses hopefully all three of them will be nominated for Best Lead Actress one of them will win,0.097236335
if any of them are nominated for Best Supporting Actress she will win the film will be nominated for Best Picture,0.042964466
now awards are arbitrary but I do believe that there's somewhat important in recognizing talented artists and while lanthum OHS has been snubbed in the past,0.105022825
the Academy has a certain affection for period pieces,0.08523044
and I think this will be the lanthum OHS film to catch their attention for me,0.10917722
it's a super super super strong 9 out of 10,0.15031679
but I'd like to watch it a few more times before I can confidently decide whether or not,0.053490475
it's worthy of being a 10 out of 10,0.21664122
it's a very close second to the lobster but all of his films are so good,0.15155451
it's really hard to compare see this movie if not for yourself then for me and if you have seen it then let me know what you think in the comments,0.07903481
thank you for watching,0.03569597
and I'll see you next,0.16106275
time,0.050087117
you,0.10154687
