hey guys,0.05914233
this is my honest review for cocoa and full disclosure I am a sucker for Pixar,0.5876557
okay,0.050967902
every time I go it's like an event at the movie theater,0.107135065
so this time,0.076399535
I was armed with a big old tub of buttered popcorn and essentially an entire box of Kleenex in my purse because I never don't cry it's usually just a matter of how many times will I cry,0.15190436
when I see a Pixar movie so suffice to say my expectations work for Coco were very very high,0.1146838
and thankfully it lived up to them Coco tells the story of Miguel a little boy growing up in a small Mexican village whose family has a long tradition of making shoes,0.054665457
but all he wants to be in life is a musician after an argument with his parents and his grandmother on Dia de los Muertos he is transported to the land of the dead where he meets his ancestors,0.31423733
and everyone is reminded about the true meaning of family like all Pixar films the animation in Coco is just next-level,0.05997581
it is vibrant and gorgeous and realistic looking but it still maintains,0.1113428
all of the magic of an animated film in fact it's so enthralling that you sort of forget that the movie is about death and that most of the characters are skeletons and it really does play on two levels,0.09951073
it is both a stunning representation of Mexican culture and the connection to departed family,0.23187333
but it's also a classic coming-of-age story about a kid who's finding his way by gaining a deeper understanding about where he came from this notion of the afterlife and a tradition that keeps memories alive is worth thinking about long after the movie ends and someone asked me on Twitter if I think that Coco is appropriate for a little kiddo who saw Moana and loved it and I would say that Coco is a little more complicated for young ones and again lots of skeletons but honestly they are beautiful and funny and the music is just so good that I think even the youngest members of your family can approach so my review for Coco absolutely worth seeing with your entire family,0.11424539
and while they don't usually recommend it,0.08733816
I will say that I saw Coco in 3d and I thought it totally worked,0.08235884
it doesn't make stuff jump out at you it just sort of makes you more immersed in the world of the movie so I hope that you love it as much as I did and don't forget bring your tissue [Applause] [Applause],0.13857822
