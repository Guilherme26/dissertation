you know to be straight up with you I almost drove like an hour on my way to go see this film because literally this film was showing and one theater near me which was by our our way and I can't believe yesterday was Christmas that's [ __ ] insane but yeah because the day after it was so busy movie it was it's chaos I've barely got a chance to see the film but I did the shape of water the new newest film from Guillermo del Toro yeah and I gotta say I really enjoyed this film I really did I there's a couple garage side I have with this film but other than that I really really liked this film this movie is it's very darkly cute and it's just so [ __ ] bizarrely weird and just so just randomly just violent as [ __ ] and just jarring you know for example the main character here let me bring up a quick quick image here the the main character here who was doo doo doo doo doo beautifully played by Sally Hawkins I'm not I'm not very familiar with her work but she is incredible in this role why this is probably one of the most impressive female performances that's seen all year okay she plays a mute she I mean she does speak but like she kind of really doesn't but we'll get to that but mostly she really never speaks in this [ __ ] film and she conveys so much to her body language in through sign language it's just impressive I thought she was just terrific I thought the whole cast was fine I don't know I mean I guess she would definitely be the stand performance her and Doug Jones listen Doug Jones but but like the whole cast well I take that back Doug Jones her and Michael Shannon those are definitely the stanza the standouts everyone else acting-wise was completely convincing and they were just fine but yeah she was incredible and Michael by the way by the way talking about the movie ban jarring right when it was show like her daily routine like when the first shows her again by completely naked getting into the bathtub and like like like most of her day is cleaning and masturbating and just kinda like this mundane life you know I was like what the [ __ ] what Del Toro's just one of the strangest like when Michael Shannon was just just [ __ ] the [ __ ] out of his chick right and he was like going to be quiet like whoa whoa just del toral he just he'll just go left in the car if the car was the plot it'll just go left abruptly just out of [ __ ] nowhere you know that one character was his name I think his real-life name is Michaels the old barge Burt I I don't know I probably still want another say his last name correctly before making the review but this guy right here he places scientists but he plays like such a respectable just straight-up honest good [ __ ] person I think it's character name is mr. Robert Hoffman or some [ __ ] but my god I I loved his character he was just like just such a good man [ __ ] rightfully so cared for this [ __ ] man played by Doug Jones who again Doug Jones good good God I mean Hellboy Pan's Labyrinth like one day he needs to receive him and Andy Serkis should receive some kind of Lifetime Achievement Award [ __ ] because honest to god he is just exceptional as his creature like the the the the blend of practical effects and CGI but mostly just practical effects on his body is incredible like and his body language as his creature so convincing like you just utterly believe that he is just this [ __ ] what they call amphibian man like he truly believe that he is his fish man like a hundred and ten percent back at the end creature looks real real as [ __ ] and it should because I was looking at some behind-the-scenes stuff and just look at this thing like the amount of practical effects with this creature is just mind-blowing it's insane but even when he blinks you know I'm just like is that CGI did they find a way to do that practical is it like a you know both worlds woven into each other like what the [ __ ] it's just masterful work when it comes to the creature design and the sets as well I mean cinematography is gorgeous it's definitely one of the best looking films of the year but actually paused on the Scimitar ephie my god the opening leagoo big here for a second because the opening tracking shot this opening moment right here which was done in one take for the record okay well we're sort of wandering through this underwater house I'll be honest with you I'll be straight up with you I'm not even entirely sure whether this was practical or CG I'm assuming that this this shot must be a combination of practical and CGI but I really don't [ __ ] know this whole goddamn sequence could be totally practically done it could be a hundred percent real fall I know I don't know I'm gonna say just because of how dreamlike it looks is a blend of CGI and practical effects but either way the opening first sequence that's done in one take or underwater going to zone house or interior of this room is extraordinary good god some of the best semi tog Rafi here and throughout the film I've seen all year it's it's very very impressive and also actually [ __ ] it we're gonna go big one more time here the set design is particularly fantastic as well like in this the place where Octavia Spencer and right Sally Hawkins right you have the place where they work at as cleaning the women is just utterly fantastic with the sense like the room that houses the amphibian man the [ __ ] fish guy where's that oh yeah there it is it is just the attention to detail is just remarkable you know it looks like just an actual place but I could go work at tomorrow like it's it's [ __ ] insane and I know that the film takes place I think in like out in 1962 or something like that but yeah really incredible sets Michael Shannon is goddamn fantastic in this film probably one of my favorite villains of the year he's just like this [ __ ] perfectionist bigoted just darkly hilarious Vilnius guy you know like there's one scene where he's [ __ ] in the bathroom taking a piss and this one [ __ ] literally it's just like literally taking a piss on the stall just like this talking to Octavia dispenser and Sally Hawkins you know saying I was like what a [ __ ] bat if you if you're just just openly conversating when someone taking a piss like that you are the man okay what the [ __ ] this man had his his fingers written ripped off tried to have them put back on and then later like we're Moo them from their attendance out what the [ __ ] this man is [ __ ] insane um he was just such a perfect villain he was so good there's one sequence where just general he was like he was talking to like some some head guy some general Michael Shannon he was just like well you know if I failed once you know me for 13 years if I failed one time I mean they really make me a failure you know what done for you and there's just like a certain look that Michael Shannon gave the general before the general started talking again and also Jesus Christ I've never even seen that kind of body language from Michael Shannon like this man is truly an exceptional actor it's just his acting it's very nuanced it's very subtle you know it could be easy for someone to be like I don't understand why is acting so great it's the little details and there's mannerisms that make him so good um another thing that really liked is there's a lot of small moments they actually meant something and it wasn't just random for example when he's just just going ham you know having sex was with his chick right it would be easy to dismiss that seeing us like the [ __ ] was that [ __ ] dealt or outside the leak some of his sexual fantasies and to the family that was was just Brandon [ __ ] but no because later on the film when he's talking to Sally Hawkins and he's like so uh you know I like some of you meets you know do you squawk you wanna know squawkers yeah I like living to be quiet you know you know there's there's that connection there you know or what what else there's just so many like when what's-his-name is it Richard Jenkins I think it's his name really great after yeah Richard drink is shout out to that man fantastic act I've been on been in all kinds of [ __ ] right there's a scene where he crashes his car into Michael Shannon's new Cadillac I think it was Cadillac but he crashes his car into the Michael Shannon's new new new vehicle that he just bought right and when I was first watching this I was like come on movie the dumbest thing you'll make the character do some of that dumb but that Carly crash into just so happen to be Michael Shannon's car that was like oh oh nice hey you sneaky movie you love [ __ ] that that's interested interested I just a little details well that's more like a whole list other ones that I couldn't think of but that type of stuff was cool um I guess oh and this scene right here has got to be one of the battleship it's gotta be one of the best scene transitions I've seen in a movie all goddamn here I've never seen no [ __ ] like this well she's like she's touching into the window and like we zoom in crazily to these [ __ ] water droplets I'm talking like zoom zoomed in right and the way that it the cross fades into the next scene is just brilliant a lot of really cool visual techniques going on in this film oh stop the stream but what else what else can't say this was a really fantastic film um I guess let's talk about let's talk about the flaws really quick cuz there's just two main ones that held me back from really really loving this film am I can people see me oh you can good alright so number one uh well this one might be a nitpick perhaps blood maybe I'll talk to sell to be a nitpick but I really didn't buy the fact that like just on site as soon as she first was in the presence of the creature like here and also during where's the sequence where she's standing before the creature for her for her for her very first time right here as well you mean to tell me that this guy damn character was never afraid what time that she's in this creatures presence she was she showed like no substantial acts of fear just as like the whole time she was like like I know it's like 1962 and maybe she's a maybe just as a weird person but like it's like anybody seeing this creature for the first time should be under to some goddammit sense like if I'm saying that goddamn thing like that for the first time I Billy hey family got some promise in there oh hey man hey what's that hey y'all what's that wait raise my paycheck what's that [ __ ] yeah I mean like I would be happy pissing myself with fear all right I just thought those kind of ridiculous um but I guess my biggest gripe in this film would be the relationship between her and the this fish man like I just don't think that they completely nailed this relationship between the creature and her for me personally it is sweet it is cute but I felt like you know by the time we get to the third act more she's trying to break the creature out I feel like by that time I should have been like like oh my god I hope they stayed together I hope nothing happens to him oh nothing happens to the fish man and that that never happened like during a sequence where Michael Shannon is torturing the speech of this fish man Oh like I felt bad but I wasn't really that bothered you know like when I was watching Peter Jackson's King Kong and when King Kong is being shot at in the third act I mean I was almost like I'm almost in tears every time I see that sequence and King Kong because Peter Jackson is such a masterful job and making King Kong's it's so incredibly sympathetic and just totally nail the chemistry and relationship between Cohn and Naomi Watts you know so by time I'm saying King Kong being hurt like it's literally torturous look at the screen I didn't get that when the fish guy who's being tortured I don't think that they really nailed the relationship personally you know like it's almost like by the time we get to the third act and when we got there like I kind of knew we were in the third act fish guy in her like this first weakest link in the third act like but God she like literally like has sex I mean it's implied but she like has sex with the fish guy you know saying in like I like it you know it's sweet but I just wish I had a deeper connection you know to watching them on screen I wish I had more of an emotional response to watching them on screen I'm saying because special dance third act when Michael Shannon just straight up literally shoots the fish guy and shoots her you know I'm saying it was shocking but it was it was just surprising because it was shocking and it wasn't shocking because I was like oh no I just saw two characters that I've grown to love for two hours he's shot it wasn't like that it's just like god damn I got bleep del Toro did that [ __ ] good you know so yeah and unfortunately that's like a big cog in the machine to not really like that much in the film you know the relationship between her and fish guys so that was only real main negative I think the relationship between the two could have been more better executed I suppose other than that I'm feeling like a 9 yeah I'm [ __ ] 9 9 10 I mean the film is gorgeous looking the acting is stellar across the boards the music was lovely you know I thought the writing was very good there was definitely strict attention paid to these characters because each character was very distinctive I just wish I could have nailed the relationship more see ya feelin like a 9 9 10 forth it's it's definitely probably del Toro's best film in a long long time because crimson peak was like yeah oh yeah I loved like the final like 10 15 minutes but everything else besides looking visually gorgeous was just laying yeah Pacific Rim was it just pure meant for me you know um yeah yeah this is definitely his best film this far bow would you think yeah would you think about this this thing let me know your thoughts down below and that's it I'm out I thought oh I'm not if we make sure to smash that like button comment subscribe all that jazz I'm gonna be
