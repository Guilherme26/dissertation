right now we are talking the favorite a movie I had to watch before I,0.05954184
made that top 10 best list and I'm glad I watched it let's talk about,0.055664733
the good so in eighteenth-century England the close relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill,0.053907283
is threatened by the arrival of Sarah's cousin Abigail Hill resulting in a bitter rivalry,0.11923289
between the two cousins to be the Queen's favorite and what a film this was,0.046963356
it is not going to be for everyone but this is the most audience friendly,0.0972332
movie that your ghost lanthum owes has done so far and I do believe the,0.15669914
favorite is his best movie I watch killing of a sacred deer I liked it,0.49518648
I didn't like it as much as a lot of people liked it I thought,0.07651495
it was a bit underwhelming enjoy the film style enjoyed the technical aspects but the,0.14857551
story did not grip me like the story for the favorite did and the performances,0.057003014
while they were great these performances are some of the best I've seen all year,0.03542492
Olivia Colman Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone all three are going to be considered for,0.12011829
Oscars should get nominated for Oscars and another performance that not a lot of people,0.097374305
have been talking about that I've heard of so far nicholas hoult gives possibly my,0.07132435
best performance that he has ever given other than of course our boy in Mad,0.24830458
Max and the beast in x-men I like those for other reasons but acting wise,0.25004342
I think he is brilliant in this film all the performances are top-notch they should,0.05966984
be nominated considered possibly winning level performances now I did just see Emily Blunt and,0.037970778
Mary Poppins that was a great performance but it's just going to be such a,0.05431331
great competition as it should be because the director just brought out so much in,0.056976967
these characters and the writing some of the best writing I have seen all year,0.023545438
the dialogue is so crisp it's funny it's witty its off-the-cuff it seems like and,0.09111834
it has that level of humor some of the humor is in your face in,0.36665905
a good way some of the humor is subtle it has the best balance of,0.04486427
two completely different styles of humor that I have seen all year and it's real,0.033401314
it's real dialogue it's not like these people were completely proper and they are completely,0.24083814
against humor no there's a bit of corn ball in here these characters are goofy,0.5516754
they are not afraid to be themselves they're not afraid to open up to the,0.07925272
world and that comes back to the plot in the direction that this movie goes,0.1124196
because it really does just open itself up and allow us to dissect what is,0.07650578
happening even though we may not completely know what some of these metaphors mean there's,0.07302584
a lot of things in here that you really need to dive deep into and,0.08146708
I should have watched this movie twice before I reviewed it just because there is,0.06156457
a lot happening in the background a lot to pay attention to a lot of,0.06878336
things especially towards the end that tie back to the beginning things that characters say,0.06647418
lines of dialogue in the first half come back to play in the second half,0.07600277
and the way that the movie ends is going to be interpreted in different ways,0.09747426
by a lot of different people I'm not saying it's an open-ended ending it's just,0.18307397
an ending that you can think about and oh maybe it meant this but maybe,0.12913957
it meant this not inception style you'll know when you'll see it it's hard to,0.13785331
explain it but it's something that people will be able to dissect and I think,0.14692748
that's going to make the movie even better in the long run and here's an,0.073936835
odd comparison I enjoyed a movie like the mule I had a good time in,0.18557236
the theater but once I walked out and started to think about it and dissect,0.06894792
the characters and some of the acting I really kind of cooled down on the,0.11197554
film I didn't like it as much as I did when I walked out with,0.07909285
the favorite I don't know if I sat there and I was on the edge,0.093184814
of my seat like oh my gosh what's going to happen next no I was,0.14371566
just invested in these people's lives so the entertainment factor while it was there it,0.09700843
wasn't super strong and I wasn't super like on the edge of my seat but,0.1054996
after I walked out and I started think about it and I started to dissect,0.08557407
the characters and what that ending actually meant and how some characters were just completely,0.040935237
treated in the wrong way and got completely screwed over if we're being honest I'm,0.38101584
not going to say who it really made me like this movie so much more,0.119045585
and those are the best movies in my opinion the ones where you can walk,0.10485187
out think about a little bit dissect to have conversations with your friends unfortunately I,0.3255539
saw this by myself so I couldn't have any conversations but I still really enjoy,0.10153743
just sitting and riding out my review on letterboxed and thinking about it and that,0.24013726
made the movie even better lanthum as always brings a distinct style in his films,0.15849422
killing of a sacred deer and the lobster they're all odd they're quirky and the,0.43698874
favorite is probably his most quirky film but like I said at the beginning of,0.062187333
this review it's also his most audience friendly you can get on board with these,0.06147993
characters you can understand this a bit better than something like the killing of a,0.33046883
sacred deer and you can get invested in these characters a little bit more and,0.106329195
I loved loved loved loved the technical aspects the film style using the fish eye,0.084500745
lens for certain situations close-ups and he always does this but I noticed it even,0.09262093
more in the favorite I love when we look up on a character usually we're,0.02468662
looking straight forward or down but having the camera lower and looking up at Emma,0.16073827
Stone's character and looking up at Olivia Komen's character it was an interesting choice and,0.06909733
it allowed us to really dive even deeper into the psyche of them it's something,0.08973296
we see on television a lot not as much in movies but I really like,0.071619846
the decisions just the mixing of different film styles makes this film even better than,0.05347126
I think it would have been and it elevates the material as well this movie,0.08219643
was funny the general audience that I was with we were all laughing invested it,0.058215383
takes some twists and turns that you definitely do not anticipate I had no clue,0.10230625
where this story was going and I loved how this thing this giant war this,0.11074304
peace treaty it's all going on in the background but that's not what we're focused,0.06929575
on we're focused on the interactions the jealousy within Rachel and Emma's characters you don't,0.05976244
know what's going to happen next between them you can see it build up and,0.091494896
then once it comes to a head and then once you get that reveal about,0.17322944
halfway through the movie or like oh I did not see this coming and it,0.07862148
continues to increase it continues to get a little bit more heated if you know,0.1536363
what I mean you know what I mean you've seen the movie but it just,0.09135338
it keeps elevating and once it comes to a head it really really hit in,0.4054315
terms of negatives I mean I don't have that many it wasn't the most entertaining,0.100645505
movie I've seen all year there's not a major event that happens but there doesn't,0.054890703
need to be that it's a story that sticks to its guns it does exactly,0.13594128
what it needs to do with really great dialogue a hilarious moments and a bit,0.11807974
of a seductive nature that I personally really enjoyed did not expect and if I,0.058157336
was there with my parents I would have been like oh they chose wrong movie,0.08751737
some of it may have been a bit too odd for people and some of,0.10084629
the dialogue might be a bit too much in certain scenes I have this complaint,0.10026303
more often than not carry on a bit too long I think this movie could,0.09429565
have been even shorter than it was and I would not have been bothered by,0.11703602
that but overall I think the favorite was worth every penny if you're going and,0.1488478
watching in a theatre and I do think you need to see it before you,0.15440467
guys at home make your top 10 lists for the end of the year because,0.07538086
if you are a fan of film and the technical aspects and the nature of,0.040202428
what makes a good script and I really do think you will enjoy the favorite,0.09388212
and that is why I am going to give this movie a 93 percent it,0.091805175
is on the cusp of being in my top 10 movies of the year I,0.07051909

too pretentious for you I understand that if you believe so but for me a,0.24045727
