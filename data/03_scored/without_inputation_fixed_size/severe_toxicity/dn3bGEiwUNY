wait I wish I could go tomorrow now to get into a few spoilers just,0.10174383
a few thoughts that I wanted to say about the movie that couldn't really say,0.0242353
you know without spoiling the movie so if you haven't seen it and you don't,0.04072587
want spoilers stop the video now you did do whatever you have to do mute,0.2435148
it and just watch me talk like this alright whatever you have to do here,0.03566781
come the spoilers the main motivation was that you know Miguel found out that his,0.047323827
great great grandfather or he knew that his great great grandfather was a musician and,0.018022485
that that was that the music was in his blood and that's part of the,0.08810291
reason why he wanted to go on to be a musician himself now he thought,0.023327991
that this musician because of the guitar in the picture was a musician de la,0.036195967
Cruz who has who's the greatest singer in Mexican history in the movie he has,0.059299793
the signature guitar that actually the end of the guitar replicates one of the the,0.028244363
skulls that you know that we see you know on the faces of people during,0.17259985
the festivals of the Adela's Muertos and so he's like okay then the Cruz is,0.15750085
is my great-great grandfather I know I'm destined to do the music de la Cruz's,0.057380736
key phrase was you know go in and get your destiny I'm sorry I can't,0.04236355
remember exactly what he said but basically go out and get your destiny you know,0.047421608
go out and take your what's yours go out and chase your dreams and accomplish,0.2060892
them and Miguel lived by that now once he reaches the land of the dead,0.13547397
he goes in there because he stole you know guitar and when you steal from,0.15603146
the dead you end up transferring into that realm so he goes into that realm,0.2386215
looking for the looking for de la Cruz so that he could get his blessings,0.17437124
to be a musician back you know in on earth in the physical realm he,0.07386132
sees all that he sees his great great grandmother and he sees a lot of,0.069368675
the family that he had pictures of and they are like no no no there's,0.044177506
no way that we're gonna give you our blessings to be a musician no music,0.036807273
in our family okay so he meets a man named Hector Hector has been forgotten,0.17269365
by pretty much all of his family and he's just hoping that his daughter can,0.07526287
maintain his memory in that if he could get back just one time to the,0.019813824
physical world during the holiday to see his daughter that would make his world he'd,0.052703165
be able to you know disappear and go off into the unknown regions and be,0.3196172
happy so he meets up with Miguel and they make a deal you know okay,0.040971987
I'll help you find a la Cruz I know I'm if I help you find,0.1174089
a la Cruz you have to take this picture of me back to my daughter,0.2601422
so that she could remember me forever now Darren there's a twist in the in,0.03142261
the film where he realizes that and this was such a great twist in the,0.016709413
story great excellent writing to where Hector actually ends up being his father and the,0.030705541
reason why he never returned after he left you know his Hector's empty left Miguel,0.06479022
his great great grandmother that he was murdered by de la Cruz who was Miguel's,0.4293744
hero so Miguel thinks his great great grandfather who was his hero is a murderer,0.5061411
who's not only a murderer but he's a faker he's a he's a total fraud,0.58208805
he's not actually the greatest musician he actually took all of these songs from Hector,0.065398194
he stole the songs from Hector and then murdered Hector so that he could take,0.4365313
these take this music and go off and become you know known as the greatest,0.054632198
singer in the world so at that point Miguel is totally crushed however once they,0.104147136
clarify the story he realizes that hold on Hector is the guy that left his,0.028419971
family and his daughter of course is Coco who of course is Miguel's great-great-great grandmother,0.11489451
and then he realized that Hector is his great great grandfather he ends up getting,0.03223746
you know the blessings of the entire family including his great-great grandmother they he gets,0.086445935
back to the physical world and this is the super touching part is gonna make,0.0854588
you cry tears of joy when Miguel starts playing remember me for his for his,0.11044975
great-grandmother Coco who's begins to remember her father who sang that to her when she,0.054754592
was just a young child just a young baby and she pulls out the picture,0.14988649
of him there it had his face torn off before she reattaches that portion and,0.3018077
now of course he'll be remembered ever we fast forward to the next year a,0.017084576
dia de los muertos and we see you know Hector and his wife and they're,0.21254547
all dancing together and happy and enjoying Tom and it was just a beautiful moment,0.018747536
made me drop a tear made the gentleman next to me he was crying everyone,0.10976129
in the theater is emotional and it's great I'm so happy you know that that,0.018585231
this film is doing so well especially from so much that I've heard from my,0.05405615
Mexican brothers and sisters you were right you steer me in the right direction this,0.08847009
was a great film one of the greatest picture our films of all time let,0.032220166
me know how you feel about it down in the comments I kind of already,0.046390574
