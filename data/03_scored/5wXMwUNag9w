hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing the black Klansmen this film is directed,0.31089434
by Spike Lee Spike Lee is somebody that is very famous of course some I,0.07857554
say infamous he's known for being a very outspoken auteur artists as well as an,0.3526991
activist he's made a career out of making very socially and politically charged films and,0.1409429
you have to admit whether you love it or you hate him he is never,0.44741654
boring for the most part a lot of the things he does whether he falls,0.21432279
flat on his face or he excels is he does it with gusto and he,0.50588286
does it with a lot of passion which you you have to admire he is,0.13351719
extremely hit or miss with me there are times when I watch some of his,0.334703
films like 25th hour for example it's one of my favorite movies ever or do,0.07081954
the right thing another classic one of the great masterpieces he ever made I watched,0.13531701
those and I just like want to kiss him on the forehead and just praise,0.57220435
him for these these wonderful works that he's given us and then at other times,0.08468423
I just want to be like you and that's how I feel about a lot,0.10099982
of things he's done in recent years but I had heard good things about black,0.31089434
Klansmen so you know I actually was interested this is based on a true story,0.057560157
that occurred in the 1970s in the Colorado Police Department Roth stallworth is the main,0.0456257
character and he is a black man who ends up becoming the first black police,0.66190207
officer in the police department first investigator and they of course referred to him as,0.10879234
the Jackie Robinson of the police department and one day he comes across an advertisement,0.13043007
in the newspaper for the Ku Klux Klan so he just on a whim calls,0.250125
the number and pretends to be a white man who wants to join and become,0.30680278
a member he does so because I mean it's a promising lead and he needs,0.124188825
something that's bold and something to get him noticed and maybe he could get some,0.12739117
good Intel along the way and he does a really good job but the one,0.057017855
problem is at the very end he has a slip he makes a mistake and,0.24795379
he actually gives his real name Ron stallworth naturally that's an issue so one of,0.099403486
his colleagues Adam driver poses as the the white version of Ron Stallworth as they,0.18461403
try to basically work from the inside out exposing the KKK for me the idea,0.30628344
of identity is very prominent theme throughout the movie and even with within this particular,0.054714005
story you've got both characters the Adam driver character and and the the Washington character,0.08285787
they both have the name Ron stallworth their identities are always up in the air,0.0863028
always in question and it's kind of asking what does your identity say about you,0.107229255
in relation to the society that you live in like for instance Ron talks about,0.18832938
being able to speak like a white man when he needs to but he can,0.4468881
also speak jive he knows that because certain parts of society expect him to be,0.15175232
one way and another side expects him to be another and how do you change,0.089624986
accordingly even with Adam driver he is playing a Jewish man in this movie he's,0.33828145
he's pretending that he's not Jewish you have multiple points of view going on in,0.44546026
this movie and there is a lot of stereotyping and kind of cartoonish portrayals of,0.10329582
the different types of characters but I will say I think that there's a lot,0.051466852
of truth in it as well having a black man working from inside the KKK,0.654557
is of course a really compelling idea but even just the idea that a black,0.44321308
man the only black man in the police force is working within the department this,0.53490317
is brought up to him saying that you are a police officer you are betraying,0.49236345
your own people for being a pig as they say a pig or a cop,0.8268494
so we've been using that kind of rhetoric against cops you know they they are,0.13586555
real people too even though they do have a bit of a reputation at times,0.12853214
and in the film there is a character that kind of represents that he's like,0.042503174
that one bad cop or that that racist cop but the rest of the cuffs,0.5521176
defend him because ultimately they're a family and they have to stick together and you,0.13701344
can kind of understand why they do that they have their own family that they've,0.08323244
worked to build just like the Klan members have their own family just like the,0.18644199
black activists are their own family so everybody has their reasons for why they're defending,0.55079466
themselves and if I'm gonna quote rules of the game yet again this movie has,0.075113885
a really frenzied quality to it but my favorite scenes tend to be the more,0.043500077
quiet scenes I know shocker there but yeah my favorite scene honestly it's a very,0.07699564
small one and not necessarily that important but it's worth flip or the the Adam,0.07747688
driver character is talking about his Jewish identity and he talks about how you know,0.3339145
it never meant anything to him really it he didn't use it as something that,0.07651639
to define him until the moment he is harassed by a Klan member who's trying,0.31099012
to get him to prove that he's not Jewish and now all of a sudden,0.50808847
it's all that he can think about his Jewish identity it's a really quiet moment,0.44163552
it's a really reflective moment and I think an intelligent one of a poignant one,0.24048465
I like the juxtaposition between all the chaos and then the column and I do,0.19062223
think that this movie I like that it's as ambitious as it is as I,0.11422405
said there is a lot going on it is messy at times but with Spike,0.121380754
Lee I don't sometimes I'm able to excuse the messiness like I don't think that,0.09061526
that necessarily detract from it for some reason that just kind of contributes to the,0.071899965
authenticity of the work a lot of the time he's using a lot of subgenres,0.17158401
staples like blaxploitation tropes and things like that and all of that just it has,0.16565813
a certain quality to it it's got kind of a funky and cool sort of,0.40345144
thing but at times cheap as well those kinds of films they are culturally distinct,0.10529258
and I think that he kind of wants the same thing with his own films,0.31089434
and this is after all a pastiche work so he's using a lot of different,0.08487765
film clips as well especially ones from like old movies old Hollywood movie such as,0.09373684
Gone with the Wind and lots of clips from clips from Birth of a Nation,0.13113643
and he does very strange things like he adds weird sound effects and weird voiceovers,0.16448812
to them that definitely were not there originally I think he just wants you to,0.13882372
always be aware that you are watching a movie when you watch this particular film,0.15918124
because movies film is an extremely powerful medium I think it's a lot more powerful,0.10286735
than people give it credit for the way that you view people is often personified,0.07419678
in the art that you're creating the way people are treated the way people are,0.090278685
portrayed I think it says a lot about how society feels about these sorts of,0.111119114
people's in ways that they feel like they can disguise under the the kind of,0.11065387
the masks of entertainment a film like Birth of a Nation for instance is a,0.1532327
very important film a controversial one but just important in terms of film history and,0.030264404
you know it also is kind of known for helping to revive the the Ku,0.06994216
Klux Klan but at the same time I mean there is something to be said,0.26498324
for the film I mean for those of you who have seen it you know,0.14256807
it's it's an incredible piece of work very very very ambitious he's very aware of,0.1194861
these cultural effects and so he wants to make a movie that is very accessible,0.13343556
and one that is just on a basic level entertaining like this one is it's,0.07767851
very funny it's got attitude and energy and it's got a theatrical quality to it,0.11222233
as well and it's accessibility is part of its appeal so he can convey his,0.1038186
perspective through that palatability I have to say I thought that I mean there's a,0.0595018
lot of very funny performances in this movie but Topher Grace was wonderful as David,0.08054225
Duke and I never thought I would say that about Topher Grace and I also,0.24234399
never thought I'd see Topher Grace playing David Duke he is so deadpan and in,0.37005344
his delivery in this movie and part of that is very very humorous but also,0.09613283
eerie and especially what he's talking about the rhetoric he's using but how that's contrasted,0.08225538
with this kind of matter-of-fact way speaking it's a really good performance and a lot,0.074659236
of the performance is as hammy as they are worked for me in this context,0.09754902
and again it's it's all just part of Leigh's style which has always been very,0.046364445
just in-your-face yeah I did say that this movie is a little bit all over,0.261639
the place at times and I think that it could have done with a little,0.051000763
bit more focus here in there but at the same time the frenzied nature of,0.08636449
it kind of contributes to the overall feeling because this is a movie that is,0.06350675
about chaos about racism in a very divided world I wasn't too keen about how,0.2100977
they ended this movie I feel like it kind of fizzles and we're left with,0.110388845
footage that's coming from the modern day basically and I I don't know something about,0.15198922
that rubs me the wrong way I don't know if I feel like it was,0.16763264
necessary on one hand it does feel a little bit on the nose and it,0.1891493
feels preachy but on the other hand it does contribute to that whole pastiche filmmaking,0.07236791
that I mentioned adding the information from the modern day but I don't know I,0.06310297
just wish it came together a little bit more gracefully in a more kind of,0.11902611
clean manner but you know I gotta say when I when I watched the movie,0.08047283
at first I didn't know how I felt about it walking out I didn't really,0.06894846
feel like talking about it I just kind of wanted to let the the juices,0.06443893
marinate up here a little bit and it took almost 24 hours before I kind,0.25306147
of started think you know I this movie won me over the more I thought,0.07089274
about it the more I think I I actually really liked it it's definitely one,0.09269926
of Lee's better movies that he's made in a long time for wants to see,0.095869035
him have that energy that he used to have is really nice for me this,0.09943119
is one of the better movies that he's made in a long time the one,0.116316326
thing that I've always loved and admired about him is that he's he is so,0.12826064
bold he is so confident in his style and that color and all that passion,0.24214847
just radiates from him and I just feel like the lights have dimmed for a,0.109555274
long time so to see this kind of this this movie kind of pop the,0.13221796
way that it does just kind of invigorated me it gave me hope for Spike,0.25004977
Lee and that's my review thank you all for listening all my social media informations,0.08097515
