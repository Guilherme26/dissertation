what's up guys welcome to found flakes on this inning explained I'll be looking at,0.079140574
the new alien film arrival not to be confused with the mid-90s powerhouse the arrival,0.079235196
starring Charlie Sheen this has nothing to do with that and despite this movie featuring,0.1103208
Lois Lane and Hawkeye teaming up to deal with aliens there are no giant aliens,0.15629274
with laser cannons or anything like that bummer a rival is kind of like the,0.25714973
antithesis of the Independence Day sequel whereas that was an overblown spectacle this movie is,0.0831676
a much more subdued dramatic take on humanity's first contact with alien life so there's,0.27306965
a huge question at the core of this movie why are they here it's even,0.06305991
right there on the poster so we'll answer that but in addition to the ending,0.072354384
itself there is a theme throughout the movie that helps explain the movies concepts further,0.061858363
and gives a better grasp of what the ending means I'll get to that as,0.09139597
well so let's get going shall we our story begins introducing linguist teacher dr. banks,0.08748608
and her daughter Hannah we see several scenes as Hannah grows up to be a,0.10393034
teenager and then unfortunately succumbs to cancer these appear to all be in flashback and,0.5050616
take place before the main story we also get our first clue to the core,0.053154584
of their idea with Amy's daughter's name Hannah her name is a palindrome which means,0.07865653
it said the same four words as well as backwards in a sense there is,0.122369535
no beginning or end as both ways are correct now we catch up with dr.,0.05735316
banks in present day where during a class the world is shocked to learn that,0.06301075
12 shell-like spaceships have descended from the sky and planted themselves at random locations around,0.0976863
the globe a few days pass as everyone anxiously awaits to find out what the,0.08335793
ships are doing here are they here to attack or to help colonel weber then,0.1400727
enlist banks to help them decode the alien language playing our tape of strange noises,0.10881779
heard from the aliens so at this point the government already has been able to,0.07694772
communicate in some form with the aliens but they can't translate the sounds and they,0.079522885
need dr. banks along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly to help them understand what the,0.0750396
aliens are actually telling them every 18 hours an area at the bottom of the,0.23906463
ship opens up allowing the team to temporarily access inside the vessel and interact directly,0.05388904
with the aliens the aliens are known as hepta pods due to their seven tendrils,0.2784107
or legs they kind of look like a hand cross with an octopus and the,0.27838442
way they tend to communicate is via inky circles shot from the end of their,0.18588115
tendrils a majority of the movie is dedicated to the team learning more about how,0.060952626
to communicate with the aliens on each and understanding more about their intentions along the,0.14890559
way they do have two languages via the sounds they make and the circles but,0.0637786
most of the focus again is on the circles the way their language works is,0.041946523
within each circular shape they form there are distinct patterns and shapes and each of,0.03777223
these has a related meaning in our language like this one here might mean technology,0.076956004
this one weapon and this one cetera we are also told their language is nonlinear,0.11217506
which is well represented by the circles they create again there is no beginning or,0.050544724
into a circle just an infinite loop independent of the linear structure of our own,0.05644688
language and as dr. banks understands more of the aliens language she starts having more,0.090443686
and more of what are essentially visions of her deceased daughter and what we don't,0.24193515
see Hannah's father there is mention of him being a scientist hmm wonder who the,0.07688884
father is let's look at the cast here government guy don't think so Forest Whitaker,0.2786813
no that's a white baby what about Ritter well yeah obviously since he's the only,0.55181944
scientist with any lines in the movie but how is that possible if they haven't,0.050891932
even met each other before the arrival guess we don't have that one figured out,0.06036248
quite yet once they're able to communicate back and forth more successfully they translate a,0.040001802
message that seems to indicate that the aliens are here to give them a gift,0.1358551
or perhaps weapon of some kind now fearing an attack from the aliens the government,0.2989389
sends our team home and now it's up to the military to sort out these,0.086577415
alien buggers but dr. banks isn't willing to give up yet and has another interaction,0.5876557
with the alien now revealing their purpose for coming to our planet essentially in three,0.110496946
thousand years they need humanity's help and in order for us to help we have,0.07258604
to understand their language as you learn more of their language your brain is essentially,0.6540895
rewired and once you can totally understand their language you unlock its true power which,0.0896521
is the ability to travel through time yep that is one powerful language but this,0.054693293
isn't time-travel in the traditional sense this is all mentally so the traveling seems to,0.24435589
be more of her accessing visions from a sort of unconscious astral plane of time,0.15158749
which now upon understanding the language she is allowed to see also potentially her brain,0.40258846
rewiring has unlocked a dormant part of her mind allowing her access to these future,0.09154296
visions and now that dr. banks fully understands the language she is even able to,0.100762084
manipulate the ink herself to make words she has now fully tapped into the time,0.17885794
travel abilities from their language with almost no time remaining before China launches its offensive,0.18732122
on their respective ship dr. banks flashes to herself at a gala she runs into,0.075265534
the military leader of China general Shang the man who has his finger on the,0.30934593
trigger back in present day he says to her he is appreciative for what she's,0.2698616
done and knew that he could trust her when she told him what she did,0.07891909
on the phone his wife's dying words which he now whispers into her ear cut,0.26746225
back to present time and dr. banks is able to use this information to call,0.0795654
The Dictator and get him to stand down from his attack saving the ships from,0.49230975
destruction so that scene at the gala and in fact all of the scenes that,0.19515221
appeared to be flashbacks are actually taking place in the future after the events of,0.06257976
the arrival so Louisa in the future got the last words of the dictators wife,0.26309028
which she's able to use in the past to stop him from attacking but how,0.1315105
does she get to that point in the future without already having the information in,0.07065451
the past well that's because this is one of those pesky time travelling paradoxes but,0.096251756
also because of the way time travel is treated in the movie there is an,0.053123977
explanation in this case as we've seen throughout the film there is the concept of,0.01480687
the circle or that things are the same forwards as well as backwards and even,0.14515242
their language itself is nonlinear so that to me means that even if something is,0.077683166
happening in the future time is an eternal circle so the concept of the future,0.060014963
or the past is meaningless time to them is handled in a totally different way,0.07391914
conceptually that it would be normally considered to us puny humans so that's why it,0.31206807
might seem like a paradox but in this case there is an explanation for how,0.09552747
it can still make sense it's also interesting because the aliens even knowing about the,0.08061825
future threat is another paradox due to the power of their language they are aware,0.102186315
that the threat is impending and have to go through this process in our present,0.10185947
time to teach their language to humans as they're doing what they are supposed to,0.10583221
do in order to make the events in the future happen but how do they,0.044142433
know in the present about the future just like with the general it's all due,0.0317364
to the circular nature of how they consider time and not really a paradox in,0.08657249
this universe the other side of their version of time-travel is nothing can be changed,0.06744052
things are always going to happen in one way no matter what we do this,0.104702845
is applied directly to dr. banks and our unborn in the present daughter she is,0.06656979
already aware of exactly what is going to happen to Hana dying at an early,0.09060082
age so now she knows about it but again has no control over this inevitability,0.14890994
though she does choose to appreciate the time she has rather than dwelling on the,0.079728685
depressing outcome which is quite noble of her and without sounding too sappy a pretty,0.31089434
powerful overall message what you have because it won't last forever it's also clear now,0.053584266
that dr. banks is special in the sense that she is the only one that,0.0876213
can first unlock the languages code the aliens already know this due to their powers,0.083016634
that she is the one that will translate the code in the present leading to,0.06890835
teaching the others and helping them in the future and even before dr. banks meets,0.06517632
the aliens she is already having future visions of her daughter and they are sort,0.24372008
of subtly guiding her on the path to further understanding their language and now the,0.0807636
ships have left our planet dr. banks and Rin er will go on to have,0.08423798
Hannah unfortunately Ritter does eventually leave before the child's death I have a feeling that,0.12465163
dr. banks eventually revealed she knew what was going to happen to their daughter the,0.09339486
whole time and didn't share it with him until way later down the line it's,0.075444706
a pretty miserable way for things to turn out honestly one thing I really am,0.43324506
curious about though at the end dr. banks publishes a book about the aliens language,0.05900642
so now everyone around the world can understand it too but does that mean that,0.066114835
everyone would be able to access the same time travel ability of dr. banks I'm,0.060613997
not really sure but it does seem to be the direction they're implying so apparently,0.04841385
the entire human race needs to understand their language for that threat coming thousands of,0.33282357
years in the future we don't know what the threat is exactly but it is,0.07397981
still bizarre to consider everyone around the world fluttering in and out of different time,0.10201461
periods in their life all the time there you go folks the quite confusing ending,0.19763151
of arrival explained whatever time-travel is on the table it's always going to get complicated,0.06461253
but what did you guys think of arrival any other lingering questions you have that,0.06563313
I missed and if there's any other movie endings you want me to explain let,0.05638821
