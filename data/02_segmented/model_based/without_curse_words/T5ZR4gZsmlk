I have always heard about the Marx Brothers
"I've always seen little parodies of them in a lot of Tv shows I love, like Animaniacs and Pinky in their brain"
"They're just a part of American culture and I had very limited exposure to them, and now that I saw a Night at the Opera, I'm quite sad that I didn't grow up with him because they are so fun and there's a knee and their comedy"
You find bits of it here and there that are dated bits that you know
"I just didn't get jokes that were over my head or referenced things that aren't part of our culture anymore, but by and large, I would say 99 percent of their humor is still just as good today as it was back then"
And especially they come from the Depression era
and you know where we've just come out of this really really big recession
"I think a lot of their their jokes about money, and and things like that really really play to us now in a very similar way to the way it did to them to people back then"
So one of the first things that you should know about the Marx Brothers is their movies are not for everyone
"This is, however, one of the first movies that they did that really had some meat to it before their act was very vaudeville"
Different little scenarios that they would put together and travel around with
This was one of the first movies they did that actually had a significant plot
Real story to it
"If you've ever seen Looney Tunes, Animaniacs Tiny to any of those types of shows you've seen references to this movie"
Probably a lot of them
Almost Every bit of humor in all of those cartoons comes right out of this movie
They do everything you could even think to do with the Opera House as their playground
"They go up the fly system, they fly on the backdrops"
They do all sorts of crazy stunts on the set
One of my favorite moments as they replace the music and all the musicians stands
"One of the things that I love about this movie and about the Marx Brothers in general, Is they each fill their own niche"
Groucho has a really sarcastic sense of humor
"Do you follow me? Yes, well, stop following me"
"All, Have your essence"
"Chico really has all of his own, his own little language, his own little accent that he does, and he can do puns"
He can do just different plays on words and things
It's all right
That's in every contract
That's what they call a sanity clause
"Hahahahaha, You can't fool me"
There ain't no sanity clause
Harpo does the physical comedy because he never actually speaks
"Everything he does is over the top, physical, overly comedic"
It's amazing
"something I love about the Marx Brothers is the speeches that usually Groucho miss, although really, any time he or Chico give a speech it is hilarious"
"Come on, I tell you how we fly to America The first time I we started"
"we get a half way of course when we run outta gasoline and we got to go back, but joy be unconfined, Let me be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons and necking in the parlor"
But one of the other truly significant things about these brothers is that they're all super talented musically
they all do really great things
"They don't always utilize that in their movies, But they are amazing when you sit them down with their instrument that they're really good at"
"There's a song that Harpo plays and I'm not a hard player, but I've never seen the harp used the way he used it"
It was really really neat
"There's a little gag number they do on the piano that again, it was just it was musical humor"
It's in a way I'd never seen
"It's very, very smart, but it's also incredibly impressive"
They're not phoning it in
They're not giving it half of their effort
They are totally bringing intense talent to every minute of those musical numbers And it's it's fabulous
One of my favorite scenes is the contract scene
"Groucho and Chico are talking about contracts for their clients and what to include, and what not to include"
And that's really where you get to see how well they're different types of humor
Connect how well they can play off of each other
While Groucho is being very dry and very sarcastic
"You have Chico, who is doing the play on words and that scene"
I've never seen anything quite like it where two people were doing two different styles of comedy and it was working so well
It was connecting so well
A big favorite of most
everybody who's seen this movie is the stateroom scene
"It's called that because he has this little tiny cabin on a cruise ship and it's a statement, and so grouchos in there, and both of the other Marx Brothers and this one other guy in the story, they, they snuck in in his giant suitcase, So they're in there and he orders dinner"
"So then you get waiters coming in and you get somebody coming in to check the temperature, and then you get the assistant to come in and check the temperature, and you get somebody coming in to give a manicure, and every single person that comes you keep thinking Groucho is going to say no"
"No, we're full, but you keep saying, come on in"
come on in
"come on in, and by the time it's all said and done, there's absolute chaos in the room"
I think they said there were more than 15 people in that room all at the same time
"Overall, I would give a Night at the Opera five stars"
It's really great fun
It has a really nice little story
A really happy ending ties up nicely
"I think overall, I think anybody can enjoy this movie as great as this movie is"
It's not perfect
It's got its flaws
Some of the more technical flaws
"You'll see blips in the film from time to time just because that's the way movies were made back then, and I guess they didn't have enough coverage"
so there are several of those that happen throughout
"But as far as the content of the film, it is just it's fantastic"
I would give it between four and five stars
"I'm gonna say four stars, just because there's a few places right in the middle where it kind of was a little a little slow, and the story kind of disappeared for a few minutes, But because of tomorrow's brothers, the fact I had a story, it all was amazing, so I give it 4 stars, but I really want to give it 5"
They went and they toured this show as a vaudeville act
"first to see how audiences would react to it, and then they made revisions to the script as they went to see what, what plate and what didn't play"
"And as you hear about scenes that were cut and scenes that were kept, it becomes apparent how effective that was as a way to sort of preview the show"
"I, in fact, the State Room scene, which is again, it's one of the most classic scenes in the movie"
If not in all cinema was going to be cut
It just wasn't playing
"Wasn't playing, wasn't playing with the audiences, And then one night Groucho Ad lived the entire scene, his part of the entire scene, and the audience just was dying"
And that ultimately is the version that ended up in the movie
They wrote down what he said
This film is considered a classic even by our government
It's in the National Film registry
It was actually adopted in in 1993
"In case you don't believe me, that this movie is amazing"
"even by today's standards, it currently has a ninety-seven percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes"
That's better than probably most anything you've seen in years
"the two leads in this movie who are actually the opera singers that the whole film kind of revolves around are not actually singers, but they sing for themselves, which was kind of unique for the day to get two people to sing such intense music who weren't actual professional singers"
One story that I heard before I ever saw this movie
That really kind of sold me on the Marx Brothers humor
"Was they made a movie called A night in Casablanca, and over a Warner Brothers"
"they heard they were doing this and they wanted to sue them because Casablanca, and so they sent them this letter"
"The cease-and-desist letter, and Gruff Joe sent them back a letter and he said, I would just like to congratulate Warner Brothers on their acquisition of the town of Casablanca"
I didn't realize you owned the rights to the whole city
Consequently we'd like to counter sue you because we were the Marx Brothers before you were the Warner Brothers
"and we'd like to sue you for using part of our name in your studio, and consequently Warner Brothers did not send any reply and the suit was dropped"
Many of you who enjoy the Marx Brothers sense of humor on the screen might like to know that they had kind of a similar personality off the screen
"When they were called in to their producers office for a meeting and he was running late, they ended up taking off all of their clothes and piling up all of his office furniture up by his fireplace, like as they were burning it to keep warm"
"he ended up being about three hours late for that meeting, but he was never late again"
"If you really enjoyed a night at the opera, some other movies, you could check out our duck Soup, which is one of the other classic Marx Brothers movies, and a movie that we will be reviewing soon called Double Dynamite, which stars Groucho Marx and Frank Sinatra"
