follow up a massive critical success in a directorial debut with another movie that accomplishes,0.023030654
the same if not more feats than that one but I think that could be,0.025302256
what Jordan Peele is sitting on with this movie because simply put I thought this,0.04786994
movie was awesome it was creepy it was intelligent it was just twisted and loads,0.12296651
of fun it was a perfect blend of horror and psychological thriller with dark comedy,0.17531979
and together these elements just really fit nicely into one fluid narrative that took me,0.05179652
on a very haunting ride with endless amounts of sinister appeal I think the plotline,0.09546782
in concept is very grounded it isn't hard to put yourself in the position of,0.020556835
this family to imagine what you would really do in their situation I thought it,0.04333339
was just absolutely compelling to see how things unfolded the first act in particular the,0.020442424
opening scene do a great job of setting the stage for this plotline it gives,0.035347193
us this section of a flashback for this haunting night with this little girl it,0.34297365
gives the viewer something to think about in the back of their mind as the,0.07148529
tone then shifts to meeting the seemingly normal family the dynamics between them are all,0.037962697
common to many other families their personalities were as well which I thought just made,0.0139755085
them very easy to connect with the dialogue was naturally charming with a great sense,0.022722673
of humor it landed some solid laughs to keep me entertained and as things kind,0.10063164
of built up but all the while you can just feel that something very dark,0.023747722
and looming is foreboding in the backdrop of the story I thought it was very,0.024202706
effective in creating subtle uneasiness and I was constantly on edge waiting for something dark,0.06959617
to happen despite the atmosphere of the movie early on being kind of light and,0.026018659
I enjoyed the contrast between both feelings it doesn't take long to learn enough about,0.04343383
the characters to get a sense of they were and how their family dynamics were,0.010366222
all structured then the story really does take a turn the mood drops into a,0.034056738
much darker territory the atmosphere instantly switches to that of being very ominous as the,0.048958845
family's tethered twins make their appearance and from that minute the tension really does shoot,0.26212874
up and it doesn't waver for the rest of the runtime the scenes that progress,0.023445727
from there where I thought equally as frightening as they were just steeped in a,0.06491527
lot of just natural curiosity as to what was actually happening and I thought that,0.011288166
is where Pele really shined with his writing and his direction by weaving a story,0.012608556
that was just very haunting and eerie but at the same time thought-provoking and honestly,0.019073475
fascinating it was unpredictable and it took some appealing terms during the progression it created,0.02676566
some suspenseful home invasion sequences as well as some just pier flights for survival the,0.055262793
character tropes are all at first kind of delivered and a seemingly routine package but,0.019932227
I thought throughout this story their arcs were swapped up just enough to create some,0.030535255
fun certain members of the family I relied on four things to keep them all,0.13394803
alive and it was kind of a breath of fresh air to see some of,0.0463194
the character tropes switched up a bit this added a ton of enjoyment to the,0.027809333
already unique premise and it gave just the entire film a fresh vibe to it,0.02160716
and I don't want to go into a lot of spoilers by speaking too much,0.036185324
on the doppelgangers in this movie but I will say that the concept and then,0.049320042
on paper was absolutely inventive they fit perfectly into the story to hit with pure,0.103106126
frightening impact and it could not have been done without the excellent cast performances all,0.04311521
the headlining actors had to play basically two versions of the roles that they took,0.034091327
on and I thought each one of them knocked it out of the park with,0.1465679
their performances I thought Lupita Nyong'o was amazing she captured both sides of her role,0.041359123
to absolute perfection as this normal mother protecting her kids I thought she capably hit,0.23360677
all the emotion and intensity needed to just root for her success and then as,0.022512475
her dark and twisted twin she was even better with a haunting performance that I,0.429872
think is award worthy I think she made this movie she was eerie and unpredictable,0.15416762
and just what this story needed to create just a great demented protagonist the easily,0.09439555
the other bright spots in the cast were the performances of young Evan Alex and,0.012492149
Shahadah right Joseph I thought these roles really required a lot of range from them,0.029201562
and it was a pressive to see both of them pull off every needed angle,0.06612059
of these characters I thought Jordan peels Direction was excellent it was an artistic it,0.041587282
was ambitious I think he showed a very inspired eye behind the camera to really,0.030010425
craft a fantastic horror film the production design and his methodical camerawork really blended together,0.057279628
with a strong use of lighting in the movie and different angles to really build,0.028604228
imposing scenes without the need for the usual jump scares I think in this movie,0.03507447
the horror was in the writing just as much as it was in the visual,0.060996674
appeal and together the result was a success it really plants the seeds for some,0.027053684
ideas early on and then the final act it explores these concepts more to create,0.062430147
just a world of thought I will be honest and say I think some of,0.044012543
these layers could have been built a little sooner in the film but it was,0.023922
still well structured enough in the closing act to not feel rushed but it was,0.040934738
very close despite that though I'm still gonna give us a solid 90 percent on,0.022451943
the entertainment meter I had a great time during this movie it was very entertaining,0.034986664
it was a blend of genres but the focus was always on the horror it,0.037906155
was a movie that really did a good job of making you think about the,0.02824902
big picture of the storylines actual setting the second act did linger just a little,0.037560258
bit but it was very minor also some of the attempts at humor kind of,0.039294392
just felt missed timed but I would have to say nothing to the extent of,0.019945532
being distracting because I think everything else in this movie shined it was filled with,0.034518376
natural characters that were able to really accomplish pulling off evil versions of themselves and,0.06729863
with Jordan Peele riding and directing the tone of the story never lost its intention,0.04170369
of just being subtly horrific and it accomplishes that thank you guys so much for,0.034576245
