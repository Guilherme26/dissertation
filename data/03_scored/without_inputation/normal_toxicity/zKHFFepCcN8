hey yeah,0.070977956
hey Jimbo son son Carsten,
what do you want hey what are your thoughts,0.088029064
on eighth grade,0.108337834
a few nights ago I got the chance to see one of my most anticipated films of the year eighth grade following the screening there was a Q&A with Bo Burnham,0.050369788
I almost got the chance to ask him a question,0.049407247
but they cut it off,0.11931351
but regardless I had a really fun time now as for the movie it's uh it's pretty good,0.07364028
I don't want to say it's this year's Lady Bird because they're two completely different movies but if I had to compare it to anything it would be that,0.11601133
and even that's a stretch,0.056684833
my point is is that this movie kind of stands in its own little box,0.079718776
it takes a lot of mainstream concepts and puts their own little a24 bo burnham style on them it's also super original in terms of its general concept,0.1516643
I mean don't get me wrong,0.12853672
there's tons of movies and TV shows about middle school and whatnot but they never seem to take themselves as seriously as they should,0.09964623
and with that being said we end up with films,0.07810146
like die of a Wimpy Kid and nothing with the real substance to it and that sucks because eighth grade really is a terrible terrible year and it's like that for a bunch of different reasons and and it's very complicated and no film has seemed to addressed it it really is like the last year or maybe even the year where people start to realize things about life,0.53490317
and with all that being said I thought that this film addressed that incredibly well given the subject matter,0.061217826
and the fact that Bo Burnham wrote and directed it I was kind of expecting it to be pretty funny and boy oh boy did it blow me out of the water,0.27439848
in that aspect,0.12486121
the jokes are perfectly timed,0.07401559
they aren't corny like a lot of Bo Burnham's actual comedy in my opinion,0.30388713
I'm sorry if you enjoy it I understand if you enjoy it,0.13883674
it's just not really my thing,0.15338415
there's a lot of visual comedy in this thing as and there's a lot of jokes that could only be told through film through editing and sound which is super,0.093783155
nice to see coming from a comedian you see what this film does super well with its humor is taking one idea and using it to its fullest potential no spoilers,0.09981735
but there are certain ideas in here where I'm like are they are they gonna go there,0.053634007
and and oh boy oh boy do they go,0.10942215
there,0.016601471
I just think that this film does humor exactly I want a film to do humor,0.07701266
and I know that's of course pretty subjective,0.056778204
that's just kind of what I enjoy in a movie but I can't really see you watching this and not smiling at least,0.10749285
once I ended up running out of time for the QA and I never got to ask him a question,0.07253846
but I was going to ask him how he was able to accurately depict eighth grade in 2018 without going through it himself,0.081867546
that's a part of this film that worked super super,0.08023619
well that really blew me out of the water since basically ninth grade I've had this fascination with middle school and and and how bad it is I just think it's a super interesting concept with loads of potential and the small details that made it what it is are all in this film this movie paid such attention to detail and I'm so glad it did because for the first time since that period of time in my life,0.07250272
I really felt like I was back in middle school,0.08462037
now don't get me wrong this film is not a straight up comedy by any means it has a very very heavy dramatic side to it I won't get into it,0.18084385
but all say is that it kind of delivered the exact amount of substance that I wanted this is where I compared to Lady Bird not because it's a coming-of-age film not because it's a 24 not because it's an artsy school movie but because it blended comedy and drama flawlessly this film a film about 8th grade told a certain subject,0.10039535
in one of the most impactful ways,0.15449391
I've ever seen is one of the first times that I felt like a foam grabbed me by the throat and forced me to understand every single inch of a topic,0.41285038
now before I wrap things up,0.086501084
I can't really talk about this film's greatness without bringing up Elsie Fisher,0.083513916
she absolutely blew me away with this performance the amount of depth and different sides to her character,0.24650422
and her acting was amazing,0.09758159
it was so exciting to watch her on screen to be honest,0.14005361
I don't even know if there are that many professional adult actors that could have pulled off the performance that she gave in this thing but put it pretty nicely in his Q&A when he described her job as performing a performance within itself and she did it amazingly to summarize 8th grade is funny it's heartbreaking,0.062131714
it's accurate it's entertaining it's incredibly rewatchable it's colorful,0.104374364
it's well shot,0.3133756
it's well acted and it's significant my best way of putting it is that this movie is a movie that I didn't know,0.07795918
I needed in my life until now and I cannot wait to see it again,0.31089434
I'm gonna give eighth grade a 5 out of 5,0.20213182
thank you guys,0.045313165
so much for watching make sure to check out eighth grade and theaters July 13th and I'll see you guys in the next one,0.09966813
