i cannot believe it is finally time to review a quiet place part two to,0.09044424
recap how this all went down for me a quiet place too was actually one,0.1336306
of the very last movies that i got to see before lockdown started i did,0.18531322
take meticulous notes back then but there was just absolutely no way i was reviewing,0.05057402
a movie over a year after seeing it good news though one i did get,0.09911018
to see the movie again and even better news now the movie's still excellent you,0.07115616
all know how it can be with sequels especially when you have an original movie,0.08344221
that winds up being such a hit and success like that 2018 film you worry,0.11559154
that making a sequel could maybe be pushing it too far and it can't possibly,0.13832732
be as good as that first one right in this case though i really think,0.10104812
it is the bulk of the story here takes place immediately after the events of,0.05134403
that first film with the remaining members of the abbott family hitting the road after,0.16611095
lee's death while out there they wind up with killian murphy's character emmett and you,0.47026587
know what i'm just going to leave it at that that's really all you need,0.15330392
and i don't want to come anywhere close to spoilers on this one focusing on,0.11475144
story structure first here i kind of can't get over how well krazynski made it,0.09095526
work and in so many ways too for example part two very much felt like,0.055504654
a major step forward for the main characters and also a big step forward in,0.055986587
the world building department and in how it fleshes out the state of the world,0.120266005
it is also very well worth noting here that krazynski opts to spend a good,0.089504555
chunk of time in the past and with that material i'll just tell you that,0.06151216
i jotted down a particular sequence in the film as a potential contender for one,0.055609778
of the best set pieces of the year and it doesn't feel like a a,0.08805338
hold on let me remind you what happened kind of moment it is exceptionally well,0.09405746
shot first of all and also perfectly paired with what we're dealing with and what,0.3590307
the characters are going through in the present the other thing i really appreciated about,0.0479822
how everything plays out here is how evelyn regan and marcus are are all on,0.057306938
their own journeys in a sense even more so than in the first film it,0.11084422
is a lot for one movie to handle but krazynski pulls it all off via,0.08103369
the script and then also in editing and i'll just tease that the editing really,0.06769312
shines in the third act there is one particular scene where you could just feel,0.059338246
the structural choice that they made making all the difference in that moment just bringing,0.04586681
together the themes of the film and the character growth and dare i say that,0.029691145
particular beat is kind of perfect i think it's perfect and then we've also got,0.1549013
to talk about the sound design here again i mean this movie better earn another,0.052596208
academy award sound nomination if you saw the first film this won't come as a,0.088031195
surprise at all the design enhances all of the scares and also bolsters every single,0.12951902
character's experience it is just endlessly exciting to me when you can hear every single,0.052157093
stitch of sound in a movie used with such purpose i will continue risk sounding,0.1157061
like a broken record here by telling you that hey the cast is stellar yet,0.10784501
again emily blunt no surprise is wonderful but by design this is millicent simmons and,0.14865991
noah jups movie the two of them went through so much in that first film,0.087193735
but jupe in particular has some really gut-wrenching moments in this one and i felt,0.14815
for him he is such an incredibly expressive actor who's giving so much every single,0.31138
second he's on screen and obviously that ability well supports what marcus is building towards,0.07111867
in these two films and then i just can't give millicent simmons enough credit for,0.14658554
how good she is in both of these movies but here in part two she,0.10176557
is just a damn star i don't want to take away from the quality of,0.7155324
her work in that first film at all because she certainly wowed me there but,0.08291757
part two gives her even more to do that elevates her from being a very,0.11706471
important part of an incredible ensemble to really being a significant force driving the whole,0.07891567
thing forward as for the aliens you do see them more in this one and,0.116051294
while i think the design is really solid admittedly again i did have that moment,0.049010243
of going oh they kind of look like a demogorgon but i think that fades,0.18949665
in a flash because you do have some really solid vfx here and also a,0.103215195
movie loaded with super rich characters with an intensely powerful emotional core if those characters,0.08755208
believed in them so did i and that made a bit of a nitpick admittedly,0.13970546
like similarities and character design just a fleeting thought for me i'm going to go,0.06569443
ahead and give a quiet place part two four and a half dewey's out of,0.15108971
five on the dewey decima movie scale i think i am uh fully obsessed with,0.18497656
this series yet again i walked away from this movie appropriately exhausted some of the,0.063889824
scenes in part two are probably the most stress inducing scares i've seen in a,0.06690695
good while and you guys know me i do love my scares and my sky,0.20361571
high tension but the real standout quality of a quiet place part two and something,0.089089185
that i do think all sequels need is is how it takes a step forward,0.077689804
thematically and also with such purpose that first movie largely focuses on the immediate family,0.011620434
raising kids and giving them everything you've got and now this one shows the results,0.118226364
of a strong parent-child relationship and what a kid can do with the values passed,0.065745674
down by a parent or a guardian figure and then maybe how they can use,0.06599766
those values and those qualities to benefit others as well clearly i think this movie,0.10440585
was incredibly well done i highly recommend you see it and when you do hit,0.19245183
the comment section below tell me what you thought of it again i i hope,0.08289682

too tell me about it in the comments i love hearing what you guys think,0.08877226
about these movies whether you agree with me or not but again i can't say,0.099687785
