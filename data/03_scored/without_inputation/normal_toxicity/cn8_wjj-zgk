but Jen what gel Denise long time no see I'm Denise the pharmacist filmmaker today I'm gonna be doing a review on the movie The Farewell,0.10494666
so this was actually if you've looked at my January 2020 Mandarin study plan if you haven't like go check it out but if you looked at that and watch that you know that one of my ways to motivate myself to continue speaking and learning Mandarin was I was going to go to a screening of this movie that I had looked up but called the farewell,0.054733578
so it was screening at a university near me,0.10848328
and I was like cool,0.056867402
you know I'll go check it out,0.09503902
and I had found it because I was looking up specifically like I googled Chinese movies near me and that one came up and so at the time I knew it was supposed to be a movie that was done in Mandarin,0.08103362
and also in English about a grandmother who's terminally ill and her family keeps it a secret from her so that's all I know about the movie I thought it was a small movie that nobody knew about like just a little film,0.31089434
and then like so I was good I was going to watch it a specific day like and within that two weeks like before I was supposed to watch it the Golden Globes happen and I'm Aquafina one the best aquafina is the lead actress in in the farewell,0.051418863
she won Best Actress let me look at my notes to get this right,0.07538801
she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a motion picture comedy or musical,0.061150346
and she's the first woman of Asian descent to win a Golden Globe as a lead actress in any category,0.29158324
what like it was a big deal,0.0984302
this is a very big deal movie,0.08475293
I thought it was just like,0.05139001
oh you know like something that has some Mandarin in it but it was awesome,0.10106949
and I did watch it,0.07119008
and I enjoyed it,0.06940003
so after I found that out I was like oh that's cool,0.046251606
so people are gonna be watching this film now that it's won like an award and let's get into like why are we still having firsts like why is she the first Asian actress to win in a lead category we should be on like,0.15173663
number 300 think it's 2020 let's knock it off with the first like let's just you know evolve,0.24035823
and let that happen I don't like that in my day and age so we're still having first stuff like people of color winning things and doing things like no no let's like let's let's let's fast forward it,0.35780782
but I'm very happy,0.04890857
and I'm very proud of her that's that's very awesome,0.068345964
alright,0.048265677
so let's get into it,0.11544536
so it really was what I thought it was that two-sentence description that I had read about the the film it was exactly what it was,0.036951266
so there's this grandma a9i who's awkwafina's grandma and she's terminally ill her whole family's not gonna tell her because so like as an American I'm hearing that and I don't speak for all Americans I'm just telling you where my perspective is coming from as an American I hear that and I'm like so doctors and people are gonna lie to you about your health,0.39560795
that's disgusting,0.47442046
that's disrespectful,0.15692572
that is infringing on your rights as a patient,0.18743986
that is you know messing up HIPPA laws where you have like the right to privacy of your information and you know like it's everything should be between you and your doctor not like your doctor tells the truth to your family and lies,0.31726205
- you know I was totally like judgmental about the entire premise of the film because I'm just like that's not,0.06607519
right,0.04255815
nope,0.029779838
nope,0.029779838
nope and,0.044969052
nope,0.029779838
no I need to know if I'm,0.050422344
dying I want to know so that I can prepare anything I need to prepare you know like fight for my,0.28400856
life you,0.14877361
know but in the movie basically one of the characters explained that I think it was awkwafina's mom said it's not the cancer that kills,0.2420712
you it's the fear like from after you know you have the cancer um whatever sort of cancer it is so if we don't tell you about the cancer you won't have fear and you won't,0.38914797
die she didn't say that,0.3334876
part but I guess that's the logic behind,0.087731645
it she just said it's not the cancer that kills you it's the,0.46810377
fear and so I still didn't accept that because I was like no it's disrespectful,0.1492572
and that's that that's my American viewpoint period,0.11600407
so it does show her the movie that this is common practice for families to keep secrets the specific secrets of people being terminally ill from the patient and then it seemed like they can tell you like when you're like on your death,0.46595237
but now they'll be like oh by the way the reason you've been feeling horrible,0.256167
and now you're dying is because you've been dying well here,0.49342233
so it turns out though that 9'i the grandma she did do the same thing to her husband so once I found that I was like okay,0.13757803
so now that like she was complicit in doing it to him,0.15499978
I guess that means she would be okay with them doing it to her she would at least understand what they were trying to do,0.12926297
and then her nice sister does say that when he was like it the time was coming that she did tell him and so night night sister said when the time really really comes for a night night,0.18608867
she will tell her own sister like hey you're dying,0.628116
how would you know,0.05415973
when the time is though like I don't know who are you to know,0.15810218
but I guess you know medical professionals can know and that's when they tell you okay hospice or you know move to hospice care and move to like okay,0.05526266
you need to set up put your affairs in order like I guess so but I don't know like things can happen or not like it's not up to just like us,0.20932965
I feel like you know,0.07183334
but that's like my religious viewpoint come in through that it's up to God who knows you know God knows not us,0.097172014
so yeah so like I said I judged it very harshly spoiler alert,0.15338607
so like stop watching right now thanks for watching,0.12632287
if you don't want to hear a spoiler come back again after you've watched it,0.12934667
and so like six years later 9i is alive and well chillin healthy,0.05857839
so once I saw that that like she is like she had this horrible diagnosis that was legit and then they don't tell her because it's the fear that's gonna get her then six years later,0.24123769
she's bear I'm like hold on do,0.14932886
I have it wrong,0.09580751
and they have it right with their lies and deception,0.51055783
and my truth is what's killing me what so when it showed that I was like ah let's let me rethink this,0.36766562
let me get,0.07071535
my judgemental viewpoint out of here,0.13844992
let me put my judgments to a side,0.16847576
and see what's like working,0.07092687
you know let's just go by the facts and the facts show that 9,0.112188034
I beat cancer by being lied to,0.2076611
so I guess lies are the cure for cancer,0.31089434
we dance,0.054313663
not Western medicine though that's Eastern but it works,0.055598594
so I guess we go with it,0.041303303
and there was a doctor who I don't I think he was trained like out and maybe in England or something,0.09661923
and then he was a Chinese young man who night,0.09266575
I was trying to set up you know with Aquafina,0.063766636
and he spoke both English and and Mandarin and he was there during nine eyes appointment where you know they're all talking in English around her like literally around her discussing her her fatal / terminally terminal diagnosis and 9ice like oh does he ask him like you know is is he single young man are you single like she's asking asking in,0.11610539
Mandarin and then Aquafina is like how bad is my grandma and then he's just,0.2761259
like,0.02861636
oh you know like he,0.08931602
just he lies,0.31089434
tonight I like they all talked about,0.05699942
it when the doctor in front of my name,0.051782567
like oh yeah it's,0.085945085
bad and then he's like,0.2656436
9 I you know you had pneumonia like it's just the pneumonia a little bit like of a cold is still left like no no it's her lungs and it's not,0.27896056
pneumonia it's terminal which in pneumonia can can kill you too sometimes but you know what I,0.7093121
mean so with that I'm saying I wanted to bring that point up because like the actual doctor who was trained in like Western medicine and Western ways was also complicit in this whole lies and shenanigans and,0.22656463
deception,0.20615764
so aquafina sort of calls him out on it and she's like don't you think this is wrong,0.19245516
and then he is just like you know,0.0844901
in China a lot of people do those been,0.05666414
she's like what if it was your grandma and he's like well,0.44245833
actually when it was my grandma we lied man,0.3407729
she was just like oh okay,0.15178986
that's that you know on good movie,0.0955809
it was a good movie,0.08030702
I really enjoyed it a lot of strong women a lot of different generations of women aquafina was not successful in her career,0.3494903
I like that that she was just like a young smart woman trying to make it who's having some upsets in her career like very realistic,0.29889175
and then she's you know an American going back to China or going to China,0.15548109
I mean and her mandarins a little funky even though it's great like I was so with her speaking Mandarin the whole time I was like get it aquafina come through with the Mandarin but I could hear with my little baby,0.20052993
I can hear that maybe she had an American accent when she spoke like obviously I am still learning Mandarin,0.10540317
I had not like talked about anybody's anything with Mandarin,0.14578575
but yeah it sounded like she sounded different than the native speakers and then sometimes like her mom would come through with like these vicious statements let's clap backs and but it wasn't even a clap back like it was just like a like it wasn't a defence,0.24240774
it was like offense I'm gonna say something like rude,0.18512373
so some people sometimes would be like you know aquafina uncle Mina's mandarin isn't even good,0.20425226
and then Aquafina was thinking of staying in China and not going back to New York where she's from because all these different because is and then her mom was like what so your grandma can see your long like sad,0.19074194
face,0.058078207
nobody wants to see her face,0.6220454
that's not good for anybody like,0.15045854
it was so funny but mean but I was here for it like you know mom's,0.20524752
sometimes they just can be mean,0.06370503
so yeah good roles for women very nice way to introduce a foreign concept in in a very like relatable way from awkwafina's point of view as an American as a chinese-american dealing with something because her herself she also thought it was not okay or thought it was weird and didn't approve,0.25225046
so I really enjoyed the movie awesome awesome movie end guys it was directed by a woman luang go girls,0.35427502
I loved it,0.06651262
so I hope that you know with award season it like keeps picking up Awards a great movie you should totally watch it my rating one thumb up totally worth seeing right,0.090747476
now as I watched it in January 2020,0.038403116
it was available on Amazon Prime,0.03883083
and however you have it's one of those that you have to pay for,0.11361044
it's not like included with Amazon Prime,0.06808987
I think I paid $4.99 so it was worth it it was definitely worth it,0.08480424
and I was happy to support a female director who did her thing,0.17642118
and Miss Aquafina who also did her thing I'm here for it don't girls,0.18189578
yeah so that's all,0.057227116
