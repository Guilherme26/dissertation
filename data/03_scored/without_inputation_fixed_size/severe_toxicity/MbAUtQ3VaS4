what's up everybody and welcome back to another movie review I'm chase Lee in the,0.017050652
movie I want to take a look at right now is the fair well now,0.028024187
this one comes from a 24 and it is written and directed by Lulu Wang,0.03472857
and this one stars Aquafina yes that Aquafina from crazy rich Asians and she stars,0.3297076
as Billie and her and her and her family live in the United States and,0.067823455
her dad gets a call from his aunt his mother's sister and she says hey,0.10991029
your mother's got stage 4 cancer she's not gonna last long just letting you know,0.49594975
and so this really kind of puts him into you know like a downward spiral,0.10209571
a little bit he's like well we gotta go we gotta go see her and,0.08890312
so you know going from the u.s. to China is not a cheap flight and,0.107157096
so they they spend a lot of money to go over there rightfully so it's,0.023424443
you know one of the family members getting sick but they what they do is,0.048417386
they staged a wedding from for Billy's cousin and they that's how they bring everyone,0.05920933
together from all over the world to go to this wedding so they could basically,0.04565621
be around her grandmother you know before she passes and just spend as much time,0.11620891
with her as possible before the day eventually comes and you know we've all been,0.027880507
there we've it's it's not it's not fun but spending as much time as you,0.04193717
can with loved one before they go he's very important and that's what they do,0.030412197
here they just do it in a very funny way and so you know going,0.03140931
into this I heard a lot about this movie from Sundance this is where I,0.03797467
heard the most pop from and I I was like oh wow with the farewell,0.04189127
aquafina drama well what is this I have to see this pronto so you know,0.06565828
from Sundance until now which is like seven months you know I've been hearing nothing,0.04003341
but great things and I solved the trailer to it and I was like this,0.031315517
looks like a really great movie like just a a solid straightforward good movie so,0.0442254
I walked out of the movie and I hate a 24 because every time when,0.07263606
I see a good movie I have to reorganize my top 10 list yet again,0.024640398
it gets a little annoying you know for first firstworldproblems indeed do not feel sorry,0.17275284
for me no this is a wonderful film it is absolutely touching it's heartbreaking it's,0.055458356
funny poignant it's just it's a really well-balanced movie and it's it's so straightforward so,0.02115151
simple its bare-bones type of filmmaking but it resonates with not only like me but,0.074474625
I think it'll resonate with like everyone else that watches this movie it's it's just,0.04541874
it's a wholesome movie that everyone can go and join everyone can appreciate with that,0.027831284
being said it is a 24 first-ever pg-rated film I know kind of weird right,0.04359547
if you saw midsummer like that's borderline nc-17 is just really funny to go from,0.048300315
that one to this one and this one is a film that while everyone can,0.03538644
enjoy it which is fantastic I love movies like that that was just pure crowd-pleasers,0.074485935
that um everyone can kind of a kind of grasp onto it and so what,0.057303574
I really appreciated about Lulu Wang's kind of writing and directing is that she doesn't,0.04387352
have to make a flashy movie she doesn't have to make something and hold our,0.06807024
attention for every three seconds with like an explosion or like a fast cut or,0.0749183
anything absurd like that it is such a straightforward story and it's really just down,0.06616781
to its simplicity that makes it so beautiful you have a film that opens up,0.026589386
with Billie and her parents they hear about the news and then they're Amelie in,0.07415534
China and from that point on all we do is just see the interactions between,0.0687148
each family member and then the movie ends it is one of the it's probably,0.043981943
the simplest movie I've seen all year the reason why resonates so well is because,0.03252482
she knows that it's a simple story and you have to elevate it with great,0.050772138
writing and great characters to start with the writing the writing is sharp it's it's,0.017081251
on point in the the comedy work she never would think a movie about death,0.09518645
there would be as much comedy either as there is but listen there's a lot,0.03768066
of goofy families out there and I appreciate that this family has enough personality to,0.24627192
wear even in its darkest times in this movie people can still be a little,0.05602842
lighter in the next scene and just enjoy each other's company and that's where the,0.0134500135
comedy comes from it feels very realistic doesn't even feel like I'm watching actors those,0.03245697
look I'm watching there's a real family go through this real struggle and Aquafina is,0.02209208
you know you know kind of sharp comedic timing does work in some scenes because,0.031122612
it once again it shows that she has personality and the whole family has personality,0.08179697
as well that they're able to kind of bounce off of her her improv and,0.23102678
her jokes and everyone else's you know might crack a joke whatever it's just it,0.092693344
felt so natural and so organic and then while it while it is you know,0.03123769
got a lot of heart and a lot of humor to it it does have,0.01718369
a lot of somberness it does have a lot of subtlety and a lot of,0.04335268
nuance in its storytelling its character development and acting with its characters this isn't a,0.015144236
movie that like feels like it was made under a Hollywood microscope where we have,0.028835045
to write every single character you know crying in hysteria because their grandmother is just,0.043843586
it's going what Lulu does fantastically and balances so well is that she she captures,0.06317249
what it is like in the final moments of someone that's about to pass everyone,0.035831448
in this movie breaks down at different moments no one breaks down at the same,0.0224719
moment and that's what I love about it at first you know Billie is like,0.03564054
kind of hesitant to go because like her grandmother's about to die but as the,0.26132062
movie coming keeps going she has her moments where she breaks her cousin has his,0.08336879
moment when he breaks at the most unfortunate situation which can apply to the comedy,0.030033708
area her dad has a nice moment her uncle has a nice moment and Anton,0.08365483
cause it's just everyone has their moment to shine and they are they're all kind,0.04542406
of coping with it in there either own speed and that's where I found once,0.040654693
again very realistic about it very very grounded and just kind of honest to how,0.021391641
humans react to this stuff and just once again there's nuance to the way they,0.03571637
are written it they're the times that they kind of kind of break down or,0.06762656
unexpected I I don't really know well like how the movie is gonna kind of,0.043981943
treat these characters how they're gonna kind of weaving out their emotions and that's what,0.04618636
is kind of so beautiful about it is because everyone's human in this movie everyone,0.225569
feels like a real human just kind of coping with this thing in different ways,0.19634625
and I really love the kind of grieving process that each of these family members,0.022753272
kind of go through and on top of all that their connection is wonderful once,0.07039239
again it feels like a real family uncles aunts cousins the parents the grandparents grandparents,0.046183035
siblings it's just like everyone was bouncing bouncing off of each other so well that,0.1518581
once again goes back to Lulu lanes direction and what I was saying with the,0.017918717
writing is that balance it's all about balance ping-pong hanging back and forth showing what,0.046755094
she excuse-me needs to show excuse me I don't know what that was showing what,0.09102373
she needs to show and doing it in such a meaningful manner nothing ever feels,0.052274123
wasted this is such an airtight movie and is well edited you know for its,0.05988382
hour-and-a-half runtime it's a short movie but short sweet into the point and that is,0.040530305
the best way to describe it going to the nuance of the acting this is,0.0197054
it's really funny when I saw last year aquafina and crazy rich Asians I was,0.38255584
like alright she's got some like Melissa McCarthy vibes she's she's an interesting supporting character,0.060840357
and she's got so much personality it's so bubbly and inviting you she's the type,0.23069367
of person that you want to go hang out with I have a drink with,0.23718278
and discuss life with she does a complete 180 in this movie and I absolutely,0.057725303
love it her her subtlety in her her emotional stakes in this movie are so,0.21252817
high she picks the right moments to explode her character with where you know she's,0.22419043
talking with her mom and she's she's had enough in what she has to yell,0.23478292
at her you know um one scene where she's talking in English to one of,0.049033348
the doctors in the hospital and her grandmother can't hear but you can tell that,0.046735138
her eyes are like tearing up because she's hearing like the the news in an,0.10116645
honest way because the doctor is keeping everything hidden from her I I didn't look,0.026578743
into it I don't know if that's a cultural thing in China where if people,0.1707287
are dying if they ever struck with an illness and they only have like a,0.17807099
few months to live or something I don't know if it is culture to keep,0.07193761
them in the dark like that and just let them die peacefully you know I'm,0.68263924
not opposed to it I think that's fantastic and it kind of keeps them less,0.031065406
paranoid and just kind of lets them go peacefully I guess yeah you know I,0.34694073
I see no issue with it but if that's a cultural thing please let me,0.028511766
know down below but um yeah it's just uh they they keep up this lie,0.121129945
you know pretty well and it just takes a lot of it takes a lot,0.04768768
of toll on these these actors and these actresses and everyone is just it's so,0.076240025
somber and so kind of beautiful and poetic with their performances I really enjoyed and,0.052090533
Aquafina is fantastic everything you've heard about her and this movie is very warranted she,0.039939623
is outstanding a couple couple things and I'll go and wrap this up the second,0.033040337
thing is speaking of the cultural thing it doesn't matter if you're from China if,0.056429524
you're from Japan Taiwan any Asian territory any European territory American territory whatever everyone can,0.07634113
enjoy this you don't have to be Chinese to enjoy this film this is a,0.06652036
film about family it's about love it's about compassion it's about the grieving process it,0.02827496
is once again a human thing everyone that is a human being can enjoy this,0.057329517
movie it is a universally made movie that's what I love about it everyone can,0.03819285
watch this movie and be like I've been there I've done that so yeah I,0.052993186
mean you know I adds a grandmother that passed last year and so I kind,0.08920046
of did everything that was done in this movie like I lied to myself about,0.047814067
it I'm sure everyone else lied to themselves about it and you know when the,0.042010337
day came it hit you or maybe a hit you a day later they day,0.4216295
or two later you know it's just it's it's interesting how people people cope with,0.019633561
it and just watch this movie brought brought a lot of those memories back and,0.026651248
it's it's you know death is uh it's inevitable but it's a it's an interesting,0.2487728
process that's all I'll say and the last thing I want to say before I,0.030057654
wrap this up is that Lulu Wang while making a simplistic story did not skimp,0.08267833
on the visual aesthetic of the film the one thing I really appreciate about the,0.031779815
cinematography is not only is it clean it's you know it's clear it's it's just,0.03600905
really nice cinematography excuse me she plays with the framing a little bit if you,0.13560833
are making a movie you know typically if you have a shot like this you,0.15435188
want to have about that much Headroom between your head in the top of the,0.15874009
frame if you want to make it a shot interesting if you have them over,0.22783552
here and like the third right there or excuse me right right there like there's,0.04000015
a third there's a third and there's a third you can have their faces right,0.046648663
there you could have you know extreme close-ups and see like their face there's many,0.07898124
ways you can frame a scene and she could have easily made this visually boring,0.05799736
but what I love about it it's just it's just subtle things like this small,0.053647727
little things matter folks she has most of her her characters like this we're like,0.051696077
the top of their head is hitting the halfway point in the frame and so,0.15117829
it's mainly just like their head in like a little bit of their their chest,0.29624072
area in the bottom half of the frame and so I was thinking myself like,0.0732294
why is she doing this and I came up to the conclusion that I think,0.03758221
she did it this way because the situation that this family is going through with,0.042160004
you know the grandmother experiencing this and them experiencing the the grief and the inevitability,0.039255146
of her death is that the situation weighs on them so if the situation is,0.0721252
weighing on them it's just kind of like pushing them down a little bit and,0.26898924
like their bodies are sinking with it and that's that's how I interpret it it,0.050395645
could be something completely different she could be like I just did it cuz it,0.032512847
looked good what you does it adds a little bit of uniqueness to the film,0.029379167
but that's what I got him is that the situation is weighing on them so,0.016823824
much that's actually pushing them down in the frame once again just adding a nice,0.068305045
little extra layer to the film guys this is a wonderful film it's a it's,0.055451706
an honest film about family and about death it's a funny film it's wholeheartedly just,0.074112765
fantastic I have nothing bad to say about this movie it is a straightforward movie,0.04632472
it's airtight everything about it works for me I love the farewell quite a bit,0.04702516
I know my fiancee did too so I'm going to give the farewell an A,0.03596182
it deserves an A I have no issues with it it's gonna make the top,0.24779125
ten eventually I just need to figure out that list but thank you a 24,0.014969293
for three great ones in a row you can stop now cuz it's getting ridiculous,0.14941421
no keep coming yeah so if you've seen the farewell please comment down below and,0.040844936
let me know but until that until that let me know anything else down below,0.09949418
and that will do it for this review guys I'm chase Lee and tune in,0.02272733
