Wow,0.05193042
I I knew that Logan was going to be brutal I hoped it would be brutal but I was not prepared that the deepest cuts would be emotional,0.071015276
I mean this is a tour-de-force they swear a lot in the movie I mean it's earned it fits but boy there's a lot of swearing in here,0.11105868
so I say with the utmost respect this is a tour,0.077659875
de force for Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart and James Mangold and congrats non-callable greeters you finally get to meet Wolverine,0.074657395
this is the first time that I've seen a comic book character accurately portrayed on the silver screen as they are in the comics like wasting special things done with comic book characters on the big screen before but never have I watched a movie and said I feel like I'm reading one of those comic book stories I had that feeling a little bit with the first Avengers but that's a whole different type of story,0.05205019
Wolverine comics tend to be a little bit a little more drama a little more storing them,0.40023282
you know it's not like 90% fighting,0.14434975
so to have that transposed to the big screen is incredibly satisfying,0.14714734
and also for all of you who like to still write up comic books as well as the funny pages right or like a lesser form of storytelling,0.40609303
well I'm telling you this is what this is what we're reading you're getting it right here,0.10333168
and this is from the very first scene the first scene I felt like again,0.05911587
I was reading a Wolverine story it was perfect on every level,0.096561074
and that of course includes the fighting it was a thrill to finally see a Wolverine fight done correctly brought to life on the big screen it was just as magical,0.058229
as I'd hoped it would be I was like that's exactly how he would do it,0.07233607
and it wasn't overly gory,0.091756485
I mean it was just it was just right,0.075279735
you know like they didn't err on the side of caution,0.072282866
they didn't go for overt overkill,0.08780816
uh but it looked like it hurt it looks like I hurt everyone involved,0.16396144
and I loved it,0.05867915
and we're not just talking fight choreography and visual effects here we're talking camerawork and also the score I thought the music was used and ibly well here and they say Johnny Cash just for the credits,0.041619003
so the score here it's not just cheats with you know songs the score is incredibly well done but you know what else is good no scripts,0.24098152
I mean it would have to be to be telling a Wolverine story the way I just said but I think we have to talk about the script in its own special section because that's very rare for comic book movies still unfortunately and had amazing one-liners and had a did a great job exploring relationships,0.060777232
but it also did a great job,0.05787383
and what it chose to leave unsaid both emotionally and in terms of story points,0.10784421
it's very sophisticated,0.07475359
you know it asks you to fill in a lot of the blanks but without directly asking you to do,0.07048993
so you had to really pay close attention,0.1126769
I think and if that's one way that this movie will benefit from repeat viewings,0.05276641
I don't know how many recent doings it's going to get we're going to talk about some of its very few flaws,0.12454218
at the end of the reveal this is no spoiler,0.056324486
so so don't worry about that,0.096873134
but I think on the screenwriting front it's definitely worth at least one more visit to try and pick up on some of the things that work,0.06199635
I think even by the end of the movie still not clarified which I which I thought was great,0.10623229
I really liked that choice,0.059318315
I mean they need to be clarified you got the overall idea,0.2777853
and you've got the same idea that the characters were getting,0.07351065
I think I was part of the experience,0.042882163
I think the magic ingredients in the script might be James Mangold because the other team screenwriters is all due respect to them,0.058507815
I mean they did contribute to the script so yeh Ovid Scott Frank worked on the last Wolverine and Michael Greene helped out with Green Lantern,0.047370825
so I'm thinking that mangle is the one that may use the special sauce here,0.0668041
and it goes to show how important it is who you hire to write these movies we've talked so much about the directors and I think that the writer should be just as important to conversation not just amongst us,0.11130335
I mean of course we would take it seriously or I hope that the studio executives would realise that as well particularly when you get results like this the movie also to my surprise reminded me of a terminator movie t2 in particular but not like hey you ripped off terminator,0.257655
but like hey here are two great movies that have a surprising amount of overlap that had not I had not seen before,0.06812828
and this movie makes it very clear,0.06464562
it also makes you miss Terminator movies I'd also like to point out on that note that there are a lot of surprises in store for you when you see this movie this year you know last year was the year like did you show too much in the trailer and people have been worried about this this year,0.06792309
so far like cure for wellness,0.09648037
they had like a ton of stuff,0.11792724
they didn't show here,0.06705921
I was amazed at how much had not been revealed about the movie and I was very very impressed with that so beware spoilers and they're just really,0.07149113
it's really great because some of you might be like how is it like a tournament,0.16910137
you'll see all right natural performance is,0.09037556
Hugh Jackman,0.085138425
this has been his signature role for 17 years,0.052319493
I can't believe he's been playing,0.114338905
this character for 17 years and with this movie he walks that down forever this is forever his I was just it was so impressive he also made me cry this movie made me cry a lot you'll want to have like,0.0818729
tissues coming out of your fists,0.68526584
like Wolverines claws like like we're not talking like,0.2293043
oh I'm teary-eyed we're talking like a single tear down my cheek you know bottom line you know I had - a 3d,0.5154597
glasses I had my regular glasses on we watch this in,0.15388435
2d and it was great just a single,0.06818372
tear I was like oh my god and then Patrick Stewart also made me cry the the subtleties and the rawness of both their performances is something to behold,0.12894765
indeed,0.047731698
and there isn't a single ounce of vanity in either of their performances and a lot of love the characters they're playing this leader,0.088760026
this is the antithesis of the paycheck gig and it was so fabulous to be able to experience that that Boyd Holbrook he makes one heck of an introduction for himself his first his first scene is one of the best conversations in a movie that is full of great conversations like this is one of those movies you know we talk about people fast forward from action sequence to action sequence or this is a movie where you will stop for some of the conversations as well and want to see them play out again,0.081173174
they're just that good,0.055712674
it's so nice to have a good script,0.07167527
it's such it was so wonderful,0.070628494
but if the film goes on the movie needs Boyd Holbrook's character less and less,0.062371638
so he kind of stayed since the background little bit,0.16864714
that's for Daphne keen she knocks her fighting scenes out of the park and she has a hundred and ten percent believable as a baby Wolverine however she doesn't have Hugh Jackman,0.18206312
and Patrick Stewart's likability factor part of that is built into the story and you'll see that when you watch the movie but part of it unfortunately is just the actress and maybe what the child is hard like what do,0.08857911
we go out for do,0.08242263
we go for someone who can sell the fight scenes or we go for someone can sell the emotional things,0.1942898
and of course you go with the fight scene that's the most important in a movie like this,0.10032588
and even if she was a bit a little bit more personable,0.26735434
I think that the script doesn't give her a moment to call her own outside of the action sequences anyway,0.080139734
so I think that also hurts your character but I felt I never really got to know x-23,0.13475418
but then also in addition to that as far as flaws,0.05823018
go,0.07473926
Moises moves perfect absolutely perfect,0.06921084
but the third act I actually kind of resent the movie a little bit for the third act and we'll talk about that in a spoiler review closer to when the film is released because I don't want to give away spoilers but I'm talking I I resent the choices that were made in the third act,0.07169726
both story wise and also in terms of message,0.030752262
and I think speaking of message one problem this film is going to potentially have is it's going to come across as being political,0.11515687
now,0.031218953
I don't know if that's intentional or if it ended up being amped up more than they intended by the way things have developed particularly here in the United States,0.100017875
but I know that there are certain things that are a problem there are like I'm a real hot-button sensitive issue across the globe,0.100778595
and this movie kind of taps into that let me just say if the Budweiser Super Bowl commercial annoy you this movie is going to make your head explode,0.5476603
and so I feel kind of bad that because of the third act choices that this movie makes in a number of areas it might hurt the film's commercial prospects,0.07109626
so I won't be curious to see how it does at the box-office long-term you know it's going to be huge,0.058608115
the first weekend I do worry about repeat business word of mouth a little bit because of that particularly in red states let's say all right all right well,0.117682375
so finally this for most part,0.051947955
and this is the only thing that keeps us from being them being equal,0.1234518
but this is very very very close to the dark night in terms of quality when it comes to comic book movies and while Marvel Studios formula has been incredibly successful they should be a little bit nervous because now Fox is two for two because what Fox are starting to do with their Marvel movies is awe-inspiring,0.130464
and it's the kind of work that we hope to see with the genre the comic book genre post Nolan but they didn't materialize and now it is materializing over at Fox which is crazy when you think about it considering what they've had to go through,0.17715126
but maybe that was part of the process but they have come out on on the other end making movies of the quality just shy,0.0915701
just shy of the quality of the Dark Knight,0.04141822
I'm not impressed so we will be discussing this for sure more as you know in much more details to get closer to the film's release,0.047552012
but I'm so happy to tell you you should definitely buy your Logan tickets and bring tissues alright alright your thought your thoughts down below,0.20315479
if you have by any chance seen the film do not spoil it for anyone,0.05685726
uh and you can check out some other videos,0.107084945
right,0.04255815
now,0.031218953
