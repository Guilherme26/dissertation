welcome back to my channel I just watched the brand new Bradley Cooper directed movie,0.019255737
a star is born and I feel like I'm like the last one of my,0.018188782
youtube critic friends to watch this movie there have been so many early screenings it's,0.046662632
kind of early it's Wednesday I guess but I finally got to see this film,0.043258224
that I was also excited for if you guys don't know how my reviews work,0.068497285
I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score,0.052135766
so many reviews coming out this weekend but right now we are talking a star,0.021716915
is born let's get right into it so a musician helps a young singer and,0.03084257
actress find fame even as age and alcoholism sins his own career into a downward,0.1157047
spiral and that's actually the first time I've read that synopsis pretty accurate and if,0.018748201
you hear that premise and you haven't heard any buzz about this film you're gonna,0.06600152
say Austin hold on okay this is a movie that I have heard before I've,0.033111513
seen it before what can you do different what can you do to impress me,0.037749838
what can you make me do to want to seek this film and watch it,0.08807231
more than any other movie in theaters right now especially with a little movie coming,0.026517546
out called venom it's going to be hard to top that so it all comes,0.058449686
down to is this movie going to appeal to the mass audience and I can,0.07070436
1000% say I absolutely think it will this thing is a crowd-pleaser if I have,0.046424497
ever seen one but it's not just that right this is some beautiful filmmaking on,0.040639393
top of technical goodness on top of great and I mean great cinematography and it,0.031543672
all comes down to Bradley Cooper I mean this guy he has been one of,0.15375388
my favorite actors for a long time he can do blockbusters he can do psychological,0.07993512
films he can do independent movies but now I think the guy has proven that,0.034570258
he can literally do anything he trained himself how to play the guitar he learned,0.05441535
how to sing I'm sure he already knew how to sing but he perfected that,0.035893973
and my goodness he steals the show in terms of his performance he was so,0.08197923
good in the role but the big factor here was he brought in Lady gaga,0.09565141
right and we have never really seen her act now she was on American Horror,0.054801818
Story I heard she did well but I didn't get a chance to check her,0.027764766
out and she is 100% in her element here she is a singer a star,0.041962445
in real life and she gets to portray those things on screen and that's one,0.04044117
of the reasons why I think she works so well is because yes she is,0.030849222
in her element I want to see her expand from this I would like to,0.066779114
see her in a different role something you wouldn't expect from her but that being,0.029499564
said I do think she did a very very very good job she conveyed emotion,0.04919166
better than I thought she would she is definitely going to get nominated for an,0.023636635
Oscar now for me should she win I don't know if I'm ready to say,0.06200443
that it's definitely not the best female performance I have seen all year but she,0.052534875
was very good she was in her element she deserves to be nominated for that,0.042086836
fact and her performances in this movie were so powerful that's one thing she can,0.03505917
do she can sing the lights out and she literally sang the lights out in,0.044863977
our theater because it was dark she was great Bradley Cooper was great Sam Elliott,0.037872232
Dave Chappelle had a supporting role now it was very very very minor like I,0.022827772
said the look at the film the shot selection the sound the sound design in,0.036059607
the theater and it may just been the theater that I was in but my,0.013918968
goodness guys I felt like I was in a concert the first third of this,0.1175752
movie there are so many performances on stage just the way that it's filmed the,0.020101849
way that it follows Bradley Cooper around right down to the conversations that people have,0.034301527
how the camera tracks them I love the way this thing was filmed and that,0.037971344
once again we are bringing this back to Bradley Cooper the man has given us,0.046874825
one of the best first directing jobs I have seen in I want to say,0.03562657
decades it got such an emotional response out of the audience I was sitting there,0.01925374
I'm not gonna lie at times I was so emotionally invested in these characters okay,0.062675595
what's going to happen next I think I know what's going to happen next which,0.036421467
I'll get into that a little bit later but I still really enjoyed it for,0.060804438
what it was and I hope I'm not selling this the wrong way guys I,0.05532066
didn't just enjoy this movie I thought this movie was phenomenal I'm just telling you,0.036174018
that it takes all of these cliche things that we have seen before and it,0.029566083
reinvents them so well I'm still sitting here trying to collect my thoughts like okay,0.07521165
what did I like about this and why was this done so well because it,0.030908423
is it's not my genre right it's not the kind of film that I see,0.030590465
myself going back to over and over but a star is born is absolutely an,0.019364161
exception just because of how well it was made but the biggest thing for me,0.023721114
when reviewing a film is all I can tell you is how I felt while,0.05402555
I was watching the movie how invested was I in these characters did I buy,0.022086093
the relationship because if you don't buy the relationship you're not going to buy the,0.018378358
rest of the film and the relationship was awesome you know when he first discovers,0.011991931
her in that bar from there on out and there's a lot of humor in,0.04775819
here too I just reminded myself of how funny some of those scenes were in,0.04242608
the bar the first I will say the first half of the film is full,0.03394166
of some great realistic humor and that's one thing I'm going to keep saying about,0.041745596
this movie is it's realistic when you're talking about the story the way that it,0.02234884
goes some things that are happening in their personal lives it's a very down-to-earth and,0.03678399
grounded story it's not we're gonna put some Nicholas Sparks in here and we're gonna,0.036463372
talk like this to let you know there even though that doesn't make any sense,0.03056652
and we're gonna do this even though that's not realistic no this is not a,0.01698613
Nicholas Sparks movie I want people to understand that people who do not want to,0.06920837
see a star is born trust me when I first saw the trailer I'm like,0.021216698
oh it's a great trailer I just don't know if there's movies for me this,0.04741562
movie is for everyone even if you don't like a good romantic comedy this isn't,0.037862252
really a romantic comedy but you know what I mean in terms of negatives I,0.043927398
mean I don't have very many there are some things that are foreshadowed in the,0.031596225
beginning and it's very obvious that Bradley Cooper was foreshadowing those things so I can't,0.031199109
say that it's necessarily a negative even though they hinted very strongly towards what was,0.024075657
going to happen at the end if you pay close attention you'll know what I'm,0.044933155
talking about especially there's a scene at the beginning just pay attention to that scene,0.04103651
but yeah I kind of knew what was going to happen but in this case,0.0313082
that doesn't really matter predictability wasn't an issue for me because the journey to that,0.011381958
destination was so well done and if you can do that I can forgive the,0.023974549
fact that the plot was a little predictable and it's also predictable because this is,0.01137065
a remake this has been done before now I have never seen those other movies,0.04559568
so I don't really have anything to compare this to and maybe that's why I,0.02493973
love this movie so much maybe I am completely wrong and the other films are,0.039257143
a lot stronger than this one but I've never seen those movies and like I,0.038329877
said Lady Gaga was fantastic she is in her element and I'm not taking anything,0.100572444
away from her do not misquote me because I thought she was worthy of a,0.13899146
nomination I just don't think she's going to win this year because it's not the,0.045024287
strongest performance I have seen and there are still many movies to come but getting,0.015728932
a home run your very first time at bat okay I'll take it and maybe,0.1308822
one or two of the scenes that were supposed to knock me out with that,0.07721917
emotional punch did not knock me out like I think he'd intended to especially towards,0.25600988
the end the other eight or nine that we're supposed to and did that definitely,0.017166395
overshadows the ones that didn't so I definitely think this movie will get you emotionally,0.111207396
invested even if you're going in with a little bit of hesitation I see y'all,0.042733394
out there just like oh I don't want gonna see the stars born you should,0.05733617
go see this when you bring us something that is this old yet well-known and,0.047842003
spin it in a completely new and fresh and just all-around different version of what,0.017540893
we thought that we have seen before I think you have accomplished a task that,0.03299045
people can rarely accomplish in Hollywood and a star is born did all of those,0.061318625
things I think this movie on a technical level on a filmmaking level is almost,0.09459843
flawless on a story level it's not perfect it's something that we have seen like,0.029651226
I said before but it just hits all of those emotional beats all of the,0.09612436
beats that it needed to hit combined with I think one of the best concert,0.08159475
experiences I have ever had first of all in the movie theater they felt like,0.037703276
I was watching a concert and III just loved every second of the guys this,0.08069742
is one of my favorite movies of the year I'm going to give a star,0.029468967
is born right now a 95 percent I just think this movie is everything that,0.022784535
you want in a crowd-pleasing emotional gut punch of a film and those are my,0.3424708
thoughts on a star is born but the most important question that I have for,0.011844926
