hello,0.054463096
everybody today,0.029480575
I'm going to be reviewing Logan directed by James Mangold as you may have heard this is Hugh Jackman's last time playing the grizzly chiseled comic book character Wolverine,0.10733968
and as his last outing he and Matt gold together they both decided,0.0647181
they wanted to have a different take on the x-men Wolverine canon with this villain,0.31935817
they took a really bold risk here,0.059108205
I think because this is not like a typical superhero movie at all,0.12124374
and I don't mean that it takes risks in terms of the narrative because there's it's very familiar,0.03140401
there's nothing there that we haven't seen before in terms of the narrative but it's more in the execution of it the style of the film that really stands out to me,0.07163482
and I think that it really paid off this film is like a rusty pipe of a villain,0.43939164
it's very gritty it's extremely violent and it feels very warm,0.24734443
you feel every stab in the film the sting of all of the wounds,0.36430973
it's very physical a physical film,0.09316955
and it's nothing like a lot of those glossy cgi more soulless true superhero films that we've grown so accustomed accustomed to seeing in the past,0.105448
and I find that refreshing quite honestly I think that this is a film with soul,0.07203687
it has a moral compass and it tries to strip away,0.20714924
all of those more obvious tropes the film starts with a brawl between Wolverine and several men and Wolverine gets knocked to the ground,0.15125737
while he's on the ground the camera is right next to him and you see in the corner of the frame Logan the name of the film,0.07069655
and I feel like that image,0.06635729
you know with the title of the film in it is a perfect metaphor for so much of what the film is is about what it's trying to say that this is not about Logan in his in his prime,0.06317287
this is about a man who is growing much older who is being beaten down offense,0.27289012
he's very weary and hurting both mentally and physically realizing that mortality is starting to eat away at him quite literally the film takes place in 2029,0.31089434
I believe and it's a far more cynical world very kind of dystopian that really reflects a lot of the social consciousness the darkness that we're experiencing right,0.1399495
now Logan is caring,0.052592076
for Charles Xavier of course the professor Eck's and he also was very very old and he keeps trying to lose his mind,0.1716841
they both come across a young girl who is a mutant that is being pursued by the antagonist the film this these corporate forces who want to turn her into a weapon,0.3515184
so I said it's a familiar story,0.0365534
this is nothing,0.10848688
we haven't seen before,0.06809379
but she is that representation of the next generation they'd be the youth that could use her power for good,0.06350724
it's a chase movie basically and I think that,0.057863064
it's something that the director men gold is very comfortable directing,0.11374454
I mean we've seen him do films like that,0.12820096
in the past,0.029212361
he's a very classical director he likes to kind of borrow from lots of genre pieces of the past,0.104521364
I mean we saw that in his remake for 3:10 to Yuma which I thought was a really solid movie there are a lot of kind of callbacks to a lot of those nostalgic narratives that you see echo in this film morally visually,0.09853708
there are call out to films like Shane which is of course a classic film as well and that someone really helps to shape the symbolism and the themes in this one this would be kind of reminds me of the Last of Us which is a video game but I think it could have easily been a film as well they're both similar stories similar ideas in terms of the tone but Naughty Dog's a company who made that film well art started this video game they wanted to make a game that was different from games,0.09356096
we had seen in the past,0.03296149
they wanted it to be a more cinematic experience one that really draw on emotion,0.08024238
so they really tried to develop great complex characters that you're playing and there's a real ensemble,0.09512687
and I think that this movie does the same thing in a lot of ways,0.15143403
it takes a genre that in my opinion has become very stale and increasingly more uninteresting as time goes on,0.15028149
but if instead it's doing something more bold,0.12901224
I think it's stripping back the story and focusing much more on the pay,0.054291084
so we see the characters arcs and we get to see them explored much more than we have in any of the other x-men films that I've seen at least,0.102589145
yeah it does resort to certain cliches here and there that I think that some could have done without but overall,0.13332078
I was I was very convinced by it I know I have criticized superhero films in the past,0.066400446
I have talked about how I think that they are too literal and too realistic and they sacrifice a lot of their artfulness in the fantasy aspect of what makes a comic book film or sorry a comic book or a graphic novel so special but I actually think it works in this instance because of how well they sell it,0.09321919
it takes the gloves off and goes all in to the point,0.10292638
it doesn't even feel like a comic-book movie at all,0.15399623
I think that somebody could just walk in and see this and they probably wouldn't really need much context,0.06920842
I mean it even includes the x-men comic book within the movie at kind of a fable to contract that fantasy from reality,0.15432717
so we can look at the situation and see that it's very separate from what people believe the idealism of it all,0.04097293
and it really does succeed in terms of just being a dramatic work because of the the core themes of the story they're very intact,0.06000472
they're very resonant,0.1640034
and they're consistent all the way through,0.06607049
I've seen a couple people here in their describe this film as a nihilistic film and I don't see it that way at all,0.07421167
I really disagree to me,0.099965334
this is the opposite of a nihilistic film it's a film that masks itself and nihilism,0.23733689
but it begins to peel back those layers of hardened calluses to reveal what is important which is love vulnerability,0.08264376
the need to connect and how that leads us to the feeling of hope that yes morality is real that people like Charles Xavier and Logan are both aging rapidly and Logan seems to be rotting from the inside and in some way but the fact is that were all rotting technically from the day we're born we're slowly getting closer to our imminent fate,0.15362029
so we must choose how we spend our life whether it's learning to love or running away from that vulnerability in those emotions,0.09081336
and that's really the main conflict,0.11721962
here in terms of what Logan is struggling with he's realizing that he does have responsibilities as a man and she can either of course be the loner that he's always been or he can learn to take his legacy and pass it on to the next generation and it's done in a way that is very kind of emotionally gut wrenching,0.15154819
I would say I was very moved by the film and I think a lot of people are going to be as well especially the hardcore x-men film fans,0.08571701
there is a lot to admire about this movie,0.077239804
so yeah thumbs up,0.09269195
and that's my review,0.073247805
