what is up guys Stu here so this week I was lucky enough to get,0.13716151
my booty over to a very advanced screening of a film which I was incredibly,0.48042393
excited for it's been released over across the pond in the States for a little,0.06655155
while now and it's doing great over there doesn't actually come out over here in,0.06489381
the UK until mid February next year but I got myself over to the screening,0.049069557
of it that film was moonlight so that's all about that so moonlights directed by,0.08672441
Barry Jenkins it's basically telling the story of this kid called Tyrone and we see,0.10645126
him in three stages of his life and the fact that we see him as,0.15267639
a kid nicknamed little as he's trying to deal with growing up in a troubled,0.18522859
environment you know his mum's a crack addict he doesn't really have a father figure,0.65116394
in his life let me go through to the second up we see him as,0.18985133
a young man in school and he's dealing with sort of discovering himself and his,0.13661033
place in the world in that sense before we move through into the final act,0.15777244
were seen as a full grown man and adult so sort of like a coming-of-age,0.07767481
film told over three parts as we sort of see this main character's life in,0.053597484
these three stages and you guys know coming-of-age films are one of my favorite genres,0.13234283
or films I love a good coming of age film that's I was excited for,0.07480362
this one and it did not disappoint at all this film absolutely blew me away,0.23989129
I love basically everything about it I'm fully expecting it to rake in all the,0.11912022
awards ever it's just so good so phone's got a really great cast of people,0.097318776
we've seen before mixed in with a bunch of newcomers who I've not seen acting,0.10644941
anything before and they were just fantastic across the board I mean the serratus we,0.11045862
played shyrone in the respective parts of his life that we're seeing in each act,0.109890364
just did a fantastic job I mean we're lucky enough to get a Q&A with,0.059135657
the director Barry Jenkins afterwards in which he explained that the three actors playing the,0.08056224
central character never actually met or kind of discussed the character with each other they,0.00994692
just sort of did it in their own ways and I mean it's a really,0.0799829
interesting character to see performed by three different people because they each bring their own,0.04429042
different things to it but there are also really interesting things that are similar throughout,0.025590992
all their performances which are unintentional or perhaps are intentional but which weren't actually discussed,0.13324042
between the actors playing the character which means that we do get a very kind,0.12450547
of interestingly well-rounded character to look at doesn't feel like we're watching three different actors,0.069252074
giving a different interpretation of a character it feels like we're just watching a progression,0.053702064
of one character which is exactly what you need in the performances they give are,0.06460906
my favorite part of this film particularly Trayvon Rhodes who plays black or sort of,0.14817375
the old adult version of genre and as we see him in the film I,0.077734515
think he does a fantastic job is the way he uses silences and the tension,0.13472022
in his face in certain scenes in the final acts is just stunning to watch,0.24088949
I think he blew it out of the park he was amazing but alongside the,0.1489427
guys playing showroom we've got other actors who as I said I'm all recognizable such,0.1312826
as Naomi Harris playing his mom in the film and Naomi Harris gives the best,0.08660302
performance I've seen from Naomi Harris yeah she's just fantastic in the film completely unrecognizable,0.15220071
to a certain point again with the chance to chat to her and Brad Jenkins,0.07623288
in the Q&A afterwards it turns out she was only on set for three days,0.05125414
on this film because a scheduling conflicts with Spector and sorting out visa problems with,0.07204721
her working in the States but three days she was on this film for three,0.07000261
days and gives all the best female performances I've seen all year but also Muhammad,0.15497881
Ali is in the film as well okay Remmy from house of cards if that's,0.057400465
where you know him from that's where I know him from I just that's all,0.047054105
I see is but he's fantastic in his own way as well everyone on the,0.12512873
cast side of things giving great performances here that really do help suck you into,0.7444275
a world which feels incredibly real and authentic and that sounds of the performances being,0.05977867
so great but it's also down to the incredible direction from Mary Jenkins I've not,0.08444036
seen any of his work before this but oh my god did this guy blow,0.35605094
me away there's just so much about this film from a directing standpoint which completely,0.10312279
took me off guard and really floored me that's not being a sort of fluidity,0.14504038
and a movement in the direction of this film it's a film which could get,0.09065723
a little bit dizzying to some there's a little bit of shaky-cam here and there,0.09570924
but I already loved his decision to move to a more kinetic style of filmmaking,0.0816776
as opposed to the usual sort of over-the-shoulder style of dialogue the way he moves,0.09577483
his camera around different characters in each scene is really wonderful to watch and there,0.07263481
are certain moments between characters which are just fantastically directed particularly just everything in the,0.04830353
final act of this film there's also a couple of moments between Shiro and his,0.09563482
mother which are just fantastically elevated by the direction for Mary Jenkins but he also,0.1502319
helped write the film as well he helped on the screenplay side of things which,0.038119063
is another reason I love this film the dialogue between characters which I say he's,0.07997885
the lack of dialogue between characters and certain scenes were just beautiful to watch the,0.09379243
main character of shyrone is that character that really doesn't say a huge amount instead,0.11593823
we understand a lot about his character and what he's going through for a lot,0.06712933
of his facial expressions his emotions which are seen through his eyes and just the,0.22275415
way he kind of navigates the world it's not really so much about the dialogue,0.12281196
as much as it is about the silence and what we can see in things,0.111070976
he isn't saying which can sound a little bit pretentious to say sometimes but it,0.16154532
is clearly an intention of beara Jenkins to get that across through this film there's,0.09820314
one particular and I think it's a very final scene of the film which just,0.050293673
blew me away just there's just a very long shot of a certain characters face,0.34903848
in the moment and you just completely understand what he's going through and see exactly,0.05484278
what his emotions are in that point without him saying a single word cinema like,0.07905972
that and filmmakers that can get such subtle emotions across without saying anything are just,0.06119881
amazing in my books it also allows for really interesting moments from a score and,0.068087325
soundtrack perspective because the Saturn in this film really is beautiful as well it's an,0.13939519
incredible juxtaposition of the sort of harsh hood reality that we're seeing in the film,0.08866703
lining up against a lot of classical music again something to Barry Jenkins said in,0.10283283
Q&A was that it was a clear intention of his to use a soundtrack which,0.06898348
you wouldn't necessarily assume would go with a film like this at least in the,0.06449087
past of cinema seeing a little stories about black neighborhoods or a story like this,0.2967849
has been a tendency to go towards sort of the more kind of urban hip-hop,0.112115845
style of things and getting in a load of tracks in that sense but I,0.09791627
really admired the use of classical music here to juxtapose that let me say this,0.10719185
being played is just stunning to listen to as well how does he can't really,0.08183178
think of a lot wrong with this film I was expecting it to be good,0.14549172
I wasn't expecting to be blown away quite as much as I was genuinely a,0.118997715
very stunning film here a story which deals with stuff and gives a different look,0.067878395
on things and we would usually get in traditional cinema and I appreciate that as,0.049167275
well just seeing a story which is so refreshingly done it's just wonderful to see,0.05173808
I love this film I haven't been able to stop thinking about ever since I,0.16928759
saw it and I cannot wait to see it again it's just a shame I,0.18629815
gotta wait three months I I don't want to do that so I'm gonna go,0.11237614
ahead and give moonlight a very well-deserved five stars it is simply stunning the level,0.06854599
of filmmaking on display here is just beautiful but what about you guys what do,0.15168512
you think of moonlight have you seen it already I know it's already out in,0.08751401
the States and has been for a little while so if you're over there and,0.09260779
you've seen it let me know what you thought in the comments below if like,0.105690986
me you live over here in gray rainy Britain then you probably gotta wait until,0.09745174
February but you may have got a chance to see it early like me if,0.082303576
you have let me know in comments below I'd love to know and as you've,0.1609689
liked reviewed on the steam you talk about more going click subscribe but until next,0.050793692
