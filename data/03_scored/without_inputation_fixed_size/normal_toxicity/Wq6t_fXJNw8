me for some reason i don't know why but i really like this one this,0.10943563
movie creeped me out black and white silent movies always creeped me out i don't,0.18288986

go watch it the cabinet of dr caligari is about a man named francis and,0.10998594
um this is actually one of the very first movies that has ever came out,0.061040897
to have the the frame story effect where it's like um you've all seen movies,0.06140743
where in the beginning there's like there'll be like two people talking or whatever and,0.083316036
they'll say i'm gonna tell you a story and then the whole movie ends up,0.100734785
being that story the person is telling the other person to and at the very,0.056761313
end you know it goes back to them telling the story if that's what a,0.07918994
frame story is and this is one of the very first movies like to have,0.047135215
that and believe it or not this is one of the very first movies to,0.057779826
ever come out with the twist ending and a very good one too i did,0.10590228
not expect that twist any coming and i guess i could say it's one of,0.07862442
the greatest twist endings in cinema history but yeah this film is about a man,0.11766448
named francis and um he's talking to this like guy next to him and then,0.24430665
like this lady in white just like kind of walks past them like looking very,0.2314539
weird i don't know and then um dr francis tells the man he's talked into,0.18911801
he tells them a story about the cabinet of dr caligari or dr caligari and,0.054729387
um basically what happens is um what's his name francis and alan are two they're,0.07670973
kind of two friends who are both competing each other to marry a woman named,0.11968587
jane james or can't talk right now jane is a woman that they're both planning,0.28848317
on marrying but like you know they're gonna find out later on and um you,0.15829092
know francis and now they're both friends they're both gonna be friends no matter what,0.16338405
no matter who marries who but um basically the film takes place at this carnival,0.116245106
where um there's a man in the name of dr caligari basically he's like running,0.0960239
this big event thing where he's telling people to come be a son ambulance which,0.15102524
we know as today as a sleepwalker and that's just what they called him back,0.18052357
then but he's telling people to meet this sleepwalker who apparently is hypnotized and he's,0.1606779
been awake for 23 years and that's how old he is and um this somnambulist,0.09561545
his name is caesar or as they would pronounce it probably back then cesar and,0.07538016
um cesar he's again he's like a sleepwalker he's been asleep all his life and,0.5154597
um you know at this main event he's like a crowd of people alan and,0.15142639
um allen and francis are one of those people and basically dr caligari keeps this,0.10011326
man named cesar in a cabinet not let's not not necessarily a cabinet but like,0.06829486
in this uh i want to see like kind of like a closet i guess,0.30257487
i don't know where he keeps them he keeps him hidden that's the point but,0.076161675
and then he opens it up and for the very first time cesar wakes up,0.066379726
dr caligari does like this weird thing where he makes him wake up and he's,0.19074026
woken up for the first time and um he says to ask he tells the,0.05409959
audience to ask cesar all these different questions so um allen goes up to the,0.06374745
sleepwalker and he tells him when will i die and basically cesar tells him you,0.5837759
will die by tomorrow at dawn and at that point i was like this just,0.42957252
got a little interesting and then you know what happens is it shows allen sleeping,0.061781533
at night and then just like a shadowy figure slowly going up to him and,0.10153939
killing him and stabbing him with the knife which is a very frightening scene by,0.83849746
the way francis and jane get married the next day and um they soon find,0.090796284
out that allen is uh murdered and um they find out that this dr caligari,0.442334
and this man named cesar are up to something that isn't very good and that,0.12734422
they're killing random people in this town and that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much,0.5553277
sums up the story of the cabinet of dr caligari now the cabinet of dr,0.052154697
caligari is again a very very creepy movie um a lot better than i thought,0.31089434
it was gonna be honestly i really really like this movie a lot and um,0.11522638
yeah it really surprised me again that swiss standing was just fantastic i loved every,0.18059821
second of this movie well some parts got a little slow here and there because,0.13607526
you know it's a silent film and you know it's just it gets very slow,0.18639007
but the movie is actually only 71 minutes long or at least the version i,0.0966166
saw was 71 minutes long so it's definitely not very long you could easily like,0.1523385
sit through the whole thing and watch it the film is very creepy what makes,0.16268308
it creepy is like just there's no sound it's just all very eerie music and,0.14705117
there's just the whole thing is just music playing and it's just so very eerie,0.07050549
and it's kind of disturbing in a way that really makes the movie very good,0.11791658
the movie has also this very strange and creepy atmosphere to it that not a,0.112506114
lot of movies have nowadays and it's just very creepy i don't know why but,0.16616826
for some reason the scene where um i don't know what to call them caesar,0.1498659
or cesar i probably have been pronouncing it wrong this whole time i don't know,0.10840109
but the part where he rakes up just really disturbs me for some reason i,0.19109969
