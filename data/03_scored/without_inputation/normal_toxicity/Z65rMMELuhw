I like the movie so much I want to see more horror movies from Jordan appeal alright so get out is basically about an interracial relationship,0.35685766
it's a white girl dating a black guy,0.555418
and it's the first black guy she's ever dated and now it's time to meet her parents and how they may or may not be able to handle the fact that she is in an interracial relationship,0.5029901
and it's very prominent like the first half of the movie the the racism and and the rate in the interracial relationship is very prominent in the first half of the movie seeing how he's nervous about it,0.19368877
she's kind of like it's gonna be fun,0.1736348
but they're like they're like awkward,0.28354475
you know about this sure enough they get to her family's house and it's not like just the house it's in a state and they have hired help who are black and immediately when I was watching this movie I was like well that's just really hitting it on the nose with the undertone of the racism that's there,0.51346606
and it reminds you subtly throughout the movie of that's what it is,0.05795504
and as it unravels from that into a thriller it just really pulls you in every single time the help that they have,0.11828191
there's something not right with them you see that in the trailer,0.10651074
so I really don't feel like I'm spoiling it right,0.12870897
now they play an important role in the movie I would say my favorite part of seeing this movie is actually seeing the performances of the team,0.060503796
the two leaves Alice and Williams and Daniel I'm gonna butcher his last name but I'm gonna attempt it I think it's clue yah,0.2512173

panther makes me really excited because I get to see him perform a lot more,0.20014358
there are some jump scares in the movie but the movie does not rely on it to be scary,0.06685259
it's really the undertone when the thriller and psychologically it really it really gets you thinking and it makes you slightly uncomfortable and towards the end of the movie I am on the edge of my seat wondering what is gonna happen,0.115532994
it really went down,0.085176945

I don't know 94 or something like that,0.14308296
but I'm so happy to see that it's still at a hundred percent,0.054018606
I really enjoy the script I thought it explored the relationship of the two leads really really well and explored the relationship between her and her parents and her parents interaction with him really really well it had your standard Jordan peels a humor,0.075880654
it's definitely in there,0.031192796
but it doesn't take you out of the movie and it's it's not in those funny lines that are in there it's not in there to be like,0.09966625
oh ha ha,0.015933098
he's Jordan Peele a comedian,0.16158493
so he has to have those funny lines in the movie it is natural and it is welcoming too because it comes at the right time there's another character who plays the leads best friend and I loved him in the movie and he's gets his own shining moment which was great,0.07236429
