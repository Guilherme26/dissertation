hey guys,0.05914231
I meant to get this review up during the week and so I apologize for that but hey better late than ever right iliza honey,0.15038863
he's coming for you,0.101255156
so the shape of water is a new romantic fancy drum that is directed by Guillermo de Torres also Corinne by him that features in some will cast that includes Sally Hawkins Richard Jenkins,0.058510426
Michael Stolberg Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer and in the ship of water,0.07887058
we follow ELISA play by selling Hawkins a mute person that communicates through sign language that works at this government lab with her friend play by Octavia Spencer and the scientists bring in this creature played by Doug Jones who forms a relationship with ELISA amongst other things that happened in this movie alrighty guys so let's get into the shape of water,0.16600573
so I was looking forward to this movie for two specific reasons,0.13489401
and one of them of course was because it was directed by Guillermo del Toro who has one of the best directors working today another reason why is because when I watched the trailer it gave me the vibe of beating the beast means Bioshock so with all those reasons combined I was hyped and I gotta tell you guys the shape of water was damn excellent,0.5013876
so I have won the acting in this movie every single performance in this movie is oscar-worthy,0.15384342
there is a single hormon to this movie that is lower than good or even subpar everywhere in this movie is giving it there a game from sally hawkins to richard jenkins to michael chan to Michael Stoler to Octavia Spencer even to Doug Jones who plays the creature,0.17084336
everybody in this movie is oscar-worthy,0.1926666
but if any actors in this movie have high chances of getting an Oscar nomination it's easily Sally Hawkins Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon but if I were to single any actor to get a nomination to possibly win the nos ker,0.07433593
it's Sally Hawkins in this movie Sally Hawkins in this movie is magnetic despite Sally Hawkins not saying a single word throughout this movie she's able to give one of the best performances that only had this year but her for a career I'm saying that without a doubt there is a moment in which she conveys her sign language that had me,0.0901583
cheering and laughing,0.07839486
this moment was absolutely incredible,0.04613106
I hope that sally hawkins gets nominated for Best Lead Actress I mean God she was greatest film but if I were to sing a lot somebody else it would easily be,0.12631604
Michael Shannon this dude,0.18612212
I don't know is about him but he plays a villain,0.2640871
so damn well and film and yours thing despite how filthy he is you understand intentions you see where his goals come from and you honestly see his point of view,0.71518975
despite him treating this creature so terribly and Doug Jones in this movie as the creature Pam and Sally Hawkins romance in her body in this movie it's just so damn sweet despite this movie being a creature in human romance Jim,0.6047862
Aldo Toro is able to make this romance,0.061081365
so just he's able to make the romance elma in this movies so fresh and he's able to make this romance,0.103166535
I know I said pathetic brain is able to make it just so sweet another thing I love about ELISA and the creatures romance was the fact that it was a romance that made these two complete you can totally tell that before this creature came along ELISA wasn't feeling complete her life,0.60451466
you know like that the life,0.10209967
no joke or the Dark Knight saying,0.09137245
you complete me you can clue too but that's how Lisa feels about this creature,0.29672596
once that creature comes up when you see her brighten up it,0.2302503
only elevates this movie so much more the romance part this movie was my favorite part of this movie and I wanted to see more of it,0.10401976
now if there is one thing that I always look forward to when I come to Newt Gilmore the horror film it's the look of the film and it's the production design and my god does demote or knock it out of the park again because with a I doubt the shape of water is one of the best looking films of twice empathy not just from what's Emmet ography but the just luscious productions and like I mentioned before when I watched this trailer for this film it gave me a Bioshock vibe and from the aesthetic of this movie just the production design alone this movie screams Bioshock if he was inspired by Bioshock for the production design I would not be surprised,0.10533699
and that would be absolutely shocked that this film was not nominated for best production design because this film is a beauty to look at and the cinematography this movie's not just from all the framing but the color palette this movie is just so beautiful to look at and not to mention the cinematography for the water scenes,0.05181097
the opening shot of this film is one of the most amazing shots of the year this shot I want so they pulled it off,0.15397353
and another thing I loved about this film was the creature design for the crucial that doug jones plays this creature is so damn cool,0.44489875
it's like a combination of like the creature the black lagoon black lagoon this creature is like a combination of The Creature from the Black Lagoon,0.4654907
and also I guess a mermaid of sorts what do you see this creature do,0.20749
its thing these moments this movie are just moments that put me in awe,0.14582528

and another thing I am she loved about the shape of water,0.09639738
and it's a term,0.038433395
I haven't used that much to script my movies this year and it's that there are so many scenes and there are so many moments of the spill that are that I described as just Hollywood movie magic there are,0.037900858
so many scenes of this movie that just made me feel like just old-fashioned film make these scenes I can only describe them one word and that was just magic,0.106373504
now in terms of flaws,0.11056879
for this movie,0.083075434
I do have a few,0.048453473
now despite that the romance is a focus of this film,0.08549551
so this movie does take place in the 60s,0.06452239
it does focus on other things that happened to safeties like the Cold War is a focus of this movie as are homophobia and racism,0.35653052
there are scenes that do tackle those things,0.07155548
and while this film does tackle those parts of the sixties,0.07246128
very well I feel like the film doesn't give the romance nearly enough attention as it should as the film goes along,0.041581675
I feel like it did get a little predictable particularly in the final scenes overall guys aside from its flies the shape of water is a beautifully done film from gimel de Toro that has quite a few moments that had me in just absolute awe so overall guys I'm gonna give the shape of water a four and a half out of five stars guys this movie is just and simple terms to put it,0.07254974
