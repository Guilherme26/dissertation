it's a good week to be an Amy Adams farm arrival is the latest film,0.10910152
by Denis Villeneuve who previously directed prisoners a very good film and Sicario an even,0.07000199
better film in my mind and the rather overlooked enemy which is also a very,0.07460907
good film starring Jake Gyllenhaal who appeared this week in another film with Amy Adams,0.027469136
who stars in this film a very good film itself that film is nocturnal animals,0.13756207
check it out if you haven't seen it but a rival as I say another,0.08926308
very good film starring Amy Adams Adams plays the character of Louise banks who is,0.030378878
an expert in linguistics and she's drafted in by the military when twelve alien spacecraft,0.15345258
land on earth at various different places around the planet she's given the task of,0.15373611
basically trying to decipher the language that is spoken by these alien creatures and find,0.24618152
out the answer to the question why are they here her character also seems to,0.08340421
have this tragic past in which she was divorced from her husband and then her,0.075867206
child contracted some kind of rare disease which eventually took that child's life I'm just,0.40328115
going to say a few things about this film what I thought about it and,0.114676245
then towards the end I'm not just gonna do spoilers I'm gonna feel like this,0.07760176
is the kind of film I need to in order to fully get to grips,0.0627066
with the themes and what what it's actually all about but don't worry I won't,0.04921695
go straight into them I will let you know when I'm gonna do spoilers so,0.45953068
you can turn off if you need to as I say right off the bat,0.34930372
denis villeneuve killing it once more Sicario was in the top ten of last year,0.37447688
prisoners as well as really great film and I'm really looking forward to his take,0.08759001
on Blade Runner but this is equally a great film to film about ideas and,0.06191023
it's a film about humanity and pain loss and love basically and beautiful moments kind,0.12527181
of mixed in with painful moments and how yeah you got to take the rough,0.24146996
with the smooth it's a very slow-moving film it takes a while to kind of,0.15437847
get to where it's going to there's a moment when they first get into the,0.06028217
ship when Amy Adams character and character played by Jeremy he was a scientist who,0.041309502
they team up with her to basically go in the ship and make contact with,0.05965987
these aliens and that whole scene where they're getting inside the ship it does take,0.26216093
a while and I got to say it's a little laborious that is really my,0.10248562
only kind of down on the film it's just it's just those moments it takes,0.14401446
a while to get going but once you get into it this is a film,0.09178683
about ideas as I say in about humanity because these alien ships have London to,0.31089434
all these different places around the world different countries are dealing with them in their,0.15126665
own unique way so you've got like China whose are prepared to go to war,0.325552
and then you've got four other countries who are like kind of following suit with,0.05799015
them they're they're prepared to follow China's lead and then you've got other countries who,0.10137675
are trying to do it in a peaceful manner trying to get to grips with,0.055283513
what's going on and then you've got other countries that are too busy thinking about,0.11778978
what other countries are doing so that's causing a lot of political kind of strife,0.25344667
so yeah it's it's a very good film that deals with what would actually be,0.08192456
the effects of aliens coming down to earth while we have all that while we,0.26926202
have that kind of global scale about the film it's a very big picture story,0.051654525
it is also a very intimate film and he's really all about this character played,0.10729753
by Amy Adams so we we kind of follow her personal story we see these,0.055513546
flashbacks that she has to her child to losing her child to losing her husband,0.40326676
and it grounds that film it grounds it in a very personal intimate story this,0.07315338
is a much warmer performance here by Adams than the previous week's film nocturnal animals,0.105116546
like I said with that film she had a bit of an uphill struggle because,0.102473214
the character wasn't a very easy character to like on the page but she did,0.087837644
very well with it to actually make us sympathize with her here however right off,0.118024275
the bat we sympathize with her you know when you start a film with your,0.31105068
main character losing their child that's it you're on their side so yeah she's definitely,0.20127982
a much easier character to like here and her performance as always with Adams is,0.05283273
absolutely spot-on jeremy renner also offers typically brilliant support is an actor who I don't,0.06934251
often think of and I'm thinking of really great actors but then when I look,0.08563322
at his career when I look at some of the films he's done he is,0.087054
actually a really great solid actor he does a very good job of showing this,0.0852946
man who's falling for this woman that he's working with but because he respects her,0.33937255
and it's not like an overblown kind of look story we don't get into the,0.07991053
typical romance tropes that you get in other films there's just a lot of subtle,0.24090584
moments that kind of builds this relationship of respect between the two film does a,0.027228177
really good job of holding the mystery of keeping you guessing it's one of them,0.08401656
films where you kind of get 2/3 of the way through of it and then,0.14981726
you start to kind of panic because you like if it just keeps on going,0.20951246
this way and then just suddenly ends if it's one of those films where it's,0.15509742
gonna demand a second watch and a third watch and fourth watch just to start,0.06446606
to get to grips with it then yeah duck that was kind of worrying me,0.24613643
because I just wasn't in a stayer mind to be honest but it does tie,0.12598227
everything together in the in the last five minutes boom Eureka it all ties together,0.07820069
and you understand the ending I think if you're not paying attention then it might,0.11636007
escape you you might go away from yeah you are paying attention then definitely it's,0.12447971
a film you will understand it's easy enough to understand I think so if you're,0.15256034
put off by that kind of film by the likes Twin Peaks you're kind of,0.17983153
David Lynch type stuff that is really hard to penetrate don't worry I don't think,0.4492009
this is that kind of film I think it does hold mystery throughout but it's,0.06610123
all tied up towards the end ultimately it just feels very real and I think,0.076575406
that's the best way to play sci fi for me personally is is when you,0.075845845
can when you can ground it when you can kind of know land ice hit,0.107952595
so to speak it just makes it more personal it makes it more relatable it,0.052426543
doesn't feel so high concept so out there like I said I did want to,0.058512118
go into spoilers and I'm gonna do that now so if you've not seen the,0.14898762
film and you don't want it spoil in go away come back later there's a,0.1579075
line in the film when Jeremy Renner's character is on a conversation with Amy Adams,0.050027467
is character and they're talking about language obviously this character Louise played by Adams she,0.07732455
is a linguistics expert and she talks about her and Rena talks about how when,0.12466866
you learn another language and you start to speak that language it changes your whole,0.13291869
perception of the world it can completely reorient ate you into a different way of,0.31089434
thinking because I did not because you're getting into touch with the way a particular,0.16522607
culture speaks I guess that is deliberately set up so that we understand the payoff,0.10044662
which is that as the film goes on we start to learn that these flashbacks,0.09818212
that Amy Adams character is having that Louise is having and not flashbacks at all,0.09734561
they are flash forwards so she didn't lose her daughter she didn't get divorced she,0.10239155
is going to lose her daughter and she is going to get divorced so by,0.25150022
getting to grips with this alien language by being able to speak it that is,0.14566402
how she is able to see into the future she's able to look at time,0.09051866
not as linear but as nonlinear so she's able to see moments from all over,0.0913707
the place and know what's coming know what's gonna happen so we learn at the,0.07060427
end of the film that obviously this character played by Rena is the guy who,0.10926162
becomes her husband he's the one she's gonna have this child with and he leaves,0.33833116
her from what we can tell from the film because she knows what's happening she's,0.063536204
seen it she knows that this child that they have they're gonna lose and he,0.18929657
can't take that he really can't deal with it and he leaves they they get,0.08189683
a divorce Villeneuve is definitely that we say preoccupied with the darker side of humanity,0.23958035
so I would say that this is his most hopeful film now I've not seen,0.0710641
in Sundays I still need to see that film but from the ones I've seen,0.044950128
this is his most hopeful I think because as much as it has its darker,0.116083965
elements this whole idea that Louise can see her future she knows what's gonna happen,0.13410151
it's also filled with hope it's also filled with beauty because she essentially makes the,0.07900043
choice at the end they're actually all that pain that I know I'm gonna suffer,0.31156498
is worth it because of the moments of beauty I'm gonna get with my child,0.2687226
with my unborn child is it worth it that that's the thing if if you,0.29424503
know your future if you could wipe out the painful moments from your future and,0.43839213
in order to do so you would have to wipe out a lot of the,0.4751448
beautiful moments and that's the trade-off can you take the rough with the smooth but,0.08363658
there you go a really great film once again by Denis Villeneuve I don't think,0.11525662
it's his best but when you're dealing with someone like Villeneuve that's not really a,0.11319632
diss on the film because he's put out some pretty fantastic work I still think,0.1283827
Sicario is his best I'd probably put this second I don't know enemy's still pretty,0.24415635
good as well but yeah I would give this a 4 out of 5 I'm,0.078078
still torn I'm I don't have to give it a 4 in half or a,0.06823449
4 I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 if you've seen a rival,0.120907836
please comment below and let me know what you thought about it and tell me,0.1078367
