eighth grade is a new film by Bo Burnham,0.15055569
and as hacia absolutely gorgeous movie that really captures the essence an awkwardness of being a teenager in middle school,0.11746703
but unlike any movie have ever done before most quiet tale of day,0.07231944
I don't talk about at school,0.11877479
but if people talk to me and stuff they'd find out that I'm like really funny and cool and talking by the way I like your shirt a lot like so cool,0.1677179
so there have been a plethora of like high school movies and all of varying degrees of success and that there really aren't that many for you know middle school,0.035874784
and there are some that maybe have character set in it but it's not really about life in that time,0.05060812
and that's what this is all about this is like a week in this the last week in this girl's life of eighth grade well as she's getting ready to graduate grade and getting ready to move on to high school,0.27521884
and this character is portrayed,0.06934183
so excellently by isla Fisher,0.15254073
that's just it feels,0.06384424
so real that it's incredible,0.047352105
I mean you'll know like I mean if every bit of it it feels so real and it feels so awkward at times I feel it feels scary at time it feels like if funny at times if so well crafted by a bo burnham and mainly his first movie and he's directing and writing it and really he got his vision on the screen so perfectly and I really again the from a 24 they let him do whatever he wanted like I've read some some interviews with him talking about the process,0.14902593
and but he's like a you know,0.19407362
he he wanted to get your real eighth-graders,0.26859325
he want to have you know 13 year-olds on screen and you know because he wanted to be real,0.111605324
we didn't want some 20 year old playing them,0.19032581
and even though when you have a 13 year old you have to work around the child laws like he's only filmed for egg nine of the day or something like that,0.20332406
I'm sure you also have to have liked to have had that I think they have to have like schooling for them to like,0.08066564
so I mean they have a lot of complications with doing this,0.10148887
but he it was so much so worth the end product that you know,0.0931107
it's just amazing that he was able to to do this in the first film finally Fisher plays Kayla and she is again an eighth grader and she is kind of an introvert but she wants to be you know popular she wants to hang out with everyone but you know she has a lot of anxiety,0.18290825
but like she does these YouTube videos in their bedroom,0.21137975
and they I when I first saw the trailers I'm a little worried about how they would incorporate the YouTube videos into the movie but the he does it really masterfully because essentially when she's going through these events in her life she's going to like her first pool party or she's meeting up with older kids from the high school that she met when she was shadowing the one at the mall,0.12691379
and there's a lot of different things that she does,0.05906562
and you see like almost like the video kind of playing like you see in the background,0.10942579
there like along with what's going on in present day,0.038652636
and like you see her like almost talking to herself like she the video was like her,0.120833784
giving advice to other people about things but really giving advice to herself and they she sometimes unable to take her own advice,0.066557385
and if it provides like an inner monologue to because a lot of times stuff to do like and not be obtrusive and a movie but this is so well crafted that it just is perfect for it,0.08994246
and like you see these moments that like the other kids like the popular kids,0.13715944
I really mean to her and like they're all it's so well done,0.13031767
especially I love because I'm like a lot some she's like it is a modern take like even at the same time,0.14960693
though I mean if you're me like if you're a guy you,0.27374217
still I think relate to her and if you were like a 7 year old woman I think you'll still relate to her you know even though you didn't have to deal with the social media and the phones yes and I think that some of the stuff in this movie could be outdated after a fear of time,0.11061137
but I've seen because like oh it'll live in this moment and I'll it's like preserving this moment forever and like I love that theme when she's on the phone or on the laptop like you know in movies most the time screen images are stimulated because they can do weird things with the lighting you know from but you know when he was making this,0.06450638
he wanted that glow you get if you ever see if you like if you ever looked at someone like looking at a phone and darkness like there's this glow that kind of like envelops their face,0.12488377
and this like almost kind of like an eerie sort of glow but it's it's kind of cool though and like there's no way to get that without actually having her like have a phone up to her face and you know when they do that,0.10101779
they like she's on Instagram she's on the different sing than they,0.06967481
they made like fake Instagram accounts like I did to make it real to make it like she's they all these kids are real and you see her like,0.21484448
she has a crush on this hot hot popular guy,0.49458376
and like every time they do that they play this like techno music that if it's really I mean that it's almost like it's objectifying this kid but I mean that's you know it's all from her eye her her viewpoint and like the score as a whole is really grex hland they throughout the movie I loved the score but you know you get this character like she is trying to deal with things than she's trying to like,0.1021984
and I've also there's a lot of hormones,0.15043138
and I think another movie another director may have like tried to stay away from some of that stuff however in doing so it would kind of lose the reality of of that of the time like when you're that old like their hormones are raging,0.26150998
even though like you get really really awkward like you have those hormones and like eoq because you don't know what's exactly going on,0.3030029
and there's some really funny and some cringy moments from this,0.15101995
well probably won my favor,0.05101638
most of the whole movie with the girl a banana,0.43313998
and the dad coming in and like because she doesn't she hates bananas but she is she was going to try to try out something on the banana but it's like so funny and awkward and I really think Josh Hamilton adds the dad he was amazing like I I hope that he gets a nominated for you know Supporting Actor because he is so perfect like I mean so awkward to be the key of the single parents raising a daughter,0.31089434
and he doesn't know exactly what's going on but he wants to be there to help her,0.09953098
and like this somebody who's like funny behalf of horrible moments with them and like I he was always kind of there for but like also same time like she doesn't want him to be there,0.25038165
they really tackled that relationship,0.088965036
so well yeah that that awkward with like she's on the phone then she just wants to be on the phone,0.19462256
and there's a lot of stuff that is if funny it's a good movie of Washington Cedars because there's so many different moments that like people will have different reactions to it like it's a very vocal crowd like cringing or good,0.11305384
oh my god like in some scenes and laughing some laugh like I know live a group a group of girls behind me laughing really loud like it's some serious some see some sequences and there are like and there are some things that you know there are some nuts throwing things,0.49746016
but there are some scary sort of moments at one point,0.08569318
and in those moments another movie may go over the top with it or make it like they go too far,0.05787957
but this one it doesn't go far all,0.080629684
but then like it's still impactful to the character,0.050957236
you know horrific ly like it's really an interesting take on like something that can happen like that and that I mean I don't know if ever seen anything quite like it,0.3528259
but if this so like really a horrible moment but you know you almost don't want to watch like if it's how no,0.17766207
it's tough to describe without like it's boiling icing,0.08409298
yeah but it's really just such an amazing movie there does,0.046862967
so many interesting things throughout the whole length,0.032937407
and I mean there's a lot here,0.071259335
and it's just like you keep wanting to go with it,0.17194387
you want to see where happen,0.09714787
what happens to how what ends up with her character,0.087047435
but then like you also don't want to know like you wanted to let her have the experience of moments herself,0.117121145
so I'm like you want to have her the camera follow every moment,0.13793053
but I really liked everything that this movie did I'm just so glad that I took a little bit of a road trip to see this like it wasn't playing in her around me,0.1155305
I know like this past,0.036462158
week,0.031186767
they upped it to like a hundred theaters but I was actually able to go like one in State College the theater had there had it like an hour away,0.0716887
so we made the trip and saw that and gotten got some steak afterwards,0.04619584
so I mean it was a great movie to see you well worth the trip,0.1765268
so if you have it look around them Fandango,0.118271545
so if you would feel like the nearest theater,0.18877417
that's playing it like it's worth making a trip to go see like we have essentially support a movie like this,0.074971884
and then the film that is so powerful,0.049887087
and so it's so well crafted,0.06968828
I I can't wait to see what Burnham does next,0.100666836
this is an amazing film,0.0732364
and I would highly recommend it,0.06566605
I probably give it like a nine point seven five out of ten maybe even the ten out of ten,0.16220902
now if I have to see if then one would be like to watch it again,0.063248396
but I don't know,0.08970421
if you'll have the same impact like in repeated viewings but I loved it,0.06912482
and if you can go see it you really,0.09798074
shouldn't go see it but thanks for watching,0.06811204
and if you got every place on my head or the scratch me on that see over there,0.2796048
and you know,0.056913003
