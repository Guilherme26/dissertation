the Irishman directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino,0.07568896
and of course a huge cast of others the Irishman is the story of an,0.0550885
ol mobster who is basically recounting the tales of his past and his possible involvement,0.44459614
in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa so this is a movie first of all my,0.10760041
of a friend of mine he's doing his best of the decade films and he's,0.11280582
challenged me and a bunch of other like-minded movie lovers to present our best of,0.258265
Latinos which was a cut it down to maybe 50 maximum 30 for the decade,0.41876617
so the Irishman of course is a movie that I had to see before I,0.083171844
closed off my list and the reason I bring that up is I'm not the,0.13092336
hugest fan of gangster films but the pedigree behind this movie and what this movie,0.34876165
was trying to pull off technologically speaking and that sort of thing I absolutely had,0.06958437
to see it so let's get into what I thought of it and I'll start,0.08622674
with the visual and when I speak of in SeaWorld's of course I'm talking about,0.034061763
the look of this film in terms of the irid us it look authentic to,0.087983
that time period I think it's like the probably forties fifties sixties that sort of,0.104195595
thing this time period we're dealing with and I said of course it does you,0.09289541
know this is Martin Scorsese he doesn't leave anything to chance with stuff like that,0.11881678
you know he's a stickler for those types of details so it film definitely has,0.12709384
that look to it and if you're a fan of his work I think you'd,0.1245021
be really happy with what he did here like his other films it's not just,0.10559056
about the costumes that the characters are wearing or details like that oh he has,0.059137896
thousands of but it's the entire neighborhood and in locations that this stuff is shot,0.1487068
in and that it's authentic to the time period it's in and I think they,0.054701254
did a really good job with that because you definitely get sucked into that immediately,0.7300115
as soon as flashbacks weekend you know I was actually as I started watching you,0.07755842
guys instantly like what period is this you know so it does look authentic to,0.27489713
that period and then of course there's the technology behind this movie done by um,0.08846999
ILM and it's DD aging of these actors you know I think it's really just,0.117971696
done on these three actors Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and for the,0.1367504
most I would say it's well done I mean what they managed to pull off,0.1297429
here we've been seeing this sort of thing before of course we've seen it before,0.088529006
with Marvel and everybody but we've never seen this type of movie use this type,0.11613977
of technology usually they use practical effects you know but this this is something where,0.06317369
they needed to take 30 years off discard there's maybe 40 years of the the,0.04420516
ages of the actors and I think especially with um I would say with Joe,0.07616195
Pesci I think they did a really good job Alice well now when I get,0.096464954
to Robert De Niro for me um there were more months where I would get,0.055256076
that feelings like if you play video games you know what I'm talking about as,0.07503736
good as this stuff can look and it really looks amazing here to get like,0.054308906
wrinkles and laugh lines and all of that stuff in there the eyes there's something,0.09414407
about the eyes that can be kind of dead and I seen a lot with,0.2597512
a robot's character Frank the Irishman Sharon I see it they I don't know if,0.08269855
it's because of the blue eyes that it stands out a bit more on him,0.17774808
than it does on Joe Pesci and that sort of thing but it did pull,0.08059545
me out time to time when that would happen when I would get like a,0.11104206
full on a long shot of his face and I just be focusing on those,0.6852013
eyes and it would just be like something is off it just seems like there's,0.05829345
nothing behind those eyes you know but it didn't happen often and the performances themselves,0.110318206
are so good that I could let that go and I'll get into the performances,0.09196648
now the acting which of course I think I feel like everybody of brings their,0.057167113
a-game to this you know because they're working with Scorsese they're gonna want to bring,0.11004279
their best and these are actors who for the most have not really been doing,0.20066534
amazing work there these are men with Stella Stella filmography of course but in recent,0.09587588
years it's been so so it's been a little crazy I mean opportunist showed up,0.5109333
in jackandjill of all things but here I thought that you could see that passion,0.2903702
for what they were doing come back and that especially goes for me without Pacino,0.1499236
his performance was the performance that kind of woke me up because there was a,0.071937606
point where um which I mean Joe Pesci Robert De Niro of course these guys,0.09636582
are fantastic together but I was just kind of watching the movie like okay yeah,0.12650542
this is good I'm enjoying this this is fine this is alright and then Al,0.04381458
Pacino comes on as Jimmy Hoffa and I sit up there's like a renewed energy,0.097381905
when he's on screen and my interest is piqued and I'm just sucked into anything,0.51649284
any conversations that include him so I just feel like he was a little bit,0.15551841
above he went above and beyond and he maybe maybe he was more invested a,0.057108134
little more passionate about what he would if I had to give the award for,0.070741855
the best actor for this movie in particular I would get it in my opinion,0.11269813
he's amazing yes Jimmy Hoffa but that does not speak ill of Joe Pesci or,0.11521726
Robert De Niro and Joe please against type in this search is so kind of,0.12760024
insane to see you know he he's the one who usually goes you know batshit,0.7103505
crazy and it was kind of nice to see a version of him playing a,0.37703308
version of a character who's a lot more stoic a character who you know he,0.08070725
doesn't let his emotions just fly off the handle so to speak I don't mad,0.15198447
about this character actually I like that a lot I always feel like you know,0.07066688
it's - should I say predictable to have like a mob boss who's always like,0.15857649
having a temper tantrum and beating somebody to death and all that sort of thing,0.6831044
I always find you know any movies or television series that covered these types of,0.08372518
characters mob bosses or drug traffickers whatever you know that kind of thing is to,0.20219193
see unintelligence to those characters that makes sense to me because if you live in,0.13816841
kind of life I mean you have to be pretty smart to stay alive so,0.49456665
I I enjoyed that aspect of what you was doing as well story-wise this movie,0.10264503
I mean it's based on a book I think the name of the book is,0.048894137
so I hear you paint houses or so I heard you paint houses and that,0.032974113
- basically means so I know you're a hip man that's other things just kind,0.31760767
of pretty cool I'm pretty messed up I've never read the book but the story,0.08609323
here is riveting enough that I mean most of us you know you may have,0.07915735
heard the name Jimmy Hoffa you know he disappeared but that was about the extent,0.05952932
of my knowledge and when you hear jokes about he's sleeping with the fishes and,0.22371136
that sort of thing but to really get into this and see that character and,0.07401336
his family and his friends are not sort of thing it was it was entertaining,0.13760959
I was intriguing to watch and that's another element of this movie that I'd quite,0.08307517
like because as massive as a spoon is in terms of scale and budget this,0.16966544
feels like it's the story of three men like it almost feels like this could,0.099481165
be an independent film that focuses on three personalities three characters and their friendships and,0.03520072
how you try to sustain loyalty and friendship in a will like that we are,0.0544461
eliminating somebody's you know taking somebody's life is just considered a business transaction I just,0.34586838
found that was the most compelling aspect of this movie for me was that friendship,0.09937249
and and how that affected them and their families are not life that they were,0.14146233
living in other than that this movie for me is a bit of a slog,0.1957646
it's really long I did feel that time crunch you know I wouldn't say I,0.10801585
was bored but I definitely was like whoo this is still happening this is still,0.066632636
going that sort of thing I did have moments where I felt I got watching,0.05960128
this movie another aspect of this film for me that was a negative was the,0.14533572
young this is old know by that I mean these actors are they're not being,0.24331954
replaced by younger actors like what used to be done in past films you know,0.10971693
I do it they were hire young the person to portray Robert De Niro or,0.08080776
Ikki Fred Frank the Irishman that sort of thing these are these actors at their,0.1748613
age which I guess is their 70s or what however will they are right now,0.025700128
playing 40 year versions of themselves and the problem with that is whenever they have,0.0642896
to be physical or anything like that it gets a little wonky I'll give you,0.40316054
guys an example and I'll try not to be too spoilery there's a scene where,0.15338147
Frank has is beating up a guy for doing something you know he's offended him,0.4317883
and it's so awkward guys um it doesn't look big everything about that scene looks,0.30349198
really awkward it looks weird it looks like the guy's just lying on the floor,0.4427714
and he kicks don't even really look like they're landing properly I don't know if,0.35253584
it's technology like trying to make him look young in the moment why he's doing,0.10476414
that it just looks like an old dude with a young face beating up someone,0.7093121
so the movements are still fun I want key and it doesn't look natural at,0.082433455
all and I see that too sometimes with how they stand or how they sit,0.10582465
and get up you can see this edge behind not so to speak you know,0.15657659
that they're trying to move like younger men but you know it's not that easy,0.10161298
to do so it's weird it's weird to see somebody you know with this young,0.1656831
face but the energy of an older person it doesn't quite work and it does,0.096789956
make for some awkward moments here and there that just feels stiff but overall guys,0.16744937
this is this is a good movie you know I would not speak ill of,0.17271882
this movie I would definitely say watch it and it's available on Netflix now so,0.06270335
if you have a Netflix account you can definitely check this out if you haven't,0.06409682
seen it in cinemas that's how I watched it this weekend and I'm gonna give,0.057315286
the Irishman a seven and a half out of ten I know a lot of,0.08229433
people are there singing praises to this movie rightfully so for me like I said,0.24082117
answer phones not my forte it's not something I really get into but as a,0.09048586
character piece I absolutely enjoyed those aspects of this movie I enjoyed the characters I,0.06250834
enjoyed seeing how their world works so to speak and if realism behind this film,0.15651707
as well you know I have to give it points for that so for me,0.07097158
personally it's a seven and a half out the time but it's a definite win,0.059892062
and it's a definite must-see of a film and that's gonna be it for this,0.062834986
