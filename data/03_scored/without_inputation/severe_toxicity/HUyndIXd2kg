hello there welcome to Brian IMAX movie talk and my review of rear-window a film,0.08972263
from 1954 which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock of course and the screenplay was written,0.021965694
by John Michael Hayes now both of these were nominated for Oscars for this film,0.049075253
and both lost quite rightly I think in the case of Hitchcock because yeah my,0.060002226
one of my favorite films of all time won that year on the waterfront and,0.013255115
John Michael Hayes lost out to the country girl yeah exactly who remembers that one,0.1407542
I don't know not me I'll tell you that much alright but both worthy nominees,0.09420863
it must be said now this film is pretty high up in the IMDB top,0.053194735
250 and it is not hard to see why there is not much I can,0.039153375
fault if anything to be honest it follows this character played by Jimmy Stewart who,0.02651023
is again excellent in this film and he's a photographer and he's basically been bound,0.040032748
to a wheelchair due to an accident that's happened so he Wiles his hours away,0.09725317
just looking out the window kind of peering into the lives of his neighbors and,0.078742445
yeah he thinks that he's cutting on to a murder that happened he doesn't necessarily,0.20908983
witness that murder but the things he's seen the behavior patterns he's witnessing leads him,0.098206386
to believe and his girlfriend that a murder has taken place has it Oh hasn't,0.19299039
it film has a lot of fun it must be said of dealing with that,0.025195826
question getting to the bottom of this mystery and I love that we never see,0.041616548
that murder I love that the question of whether he did or he didn't he's,0.16572984
always hanging in the air until we get to these it to the finale to,0.19366223
we find out the the answer to that question we in that sense a pot,0.026472313
into Jimmy Stewart cheers we're going along with this mystery as its unfolding through his,0.028568307
eyes Grace Kelly is also fantastic in this it must be said she won an,0.022149285
Oscar for this she was nominated and she did win and deservedly so I think,0.065123476
yeah really great performance and one of the greatest cinematic kind of introductions for a,0.024355033
character I think the way she comes in out of focus you know she starts,0.03297382
her opening shot she stats out a focus she kind of leans over Jimmy Stewart's,0.21919066
character and again we see it from his eyes very much how this film plays,0.03613743
all the time seeing everything through his eyes and she comes into focus and it's,0.0850251
just yeah she's striking the beautiful clearly but she also proved herself with this film,0.109015614
to be quite a formidable actress quite a talented actress Thelma Ritter is also really,0.025371434
good Stella she's this woman who kind of comes in and does housework the Jim,0.14850757
Stewart's character and yeah she just has a very kind of dry sense of humor,0.0327889
shall we say dry wit and she has this into her character has this interest,0.063202426
in like serial killers the this kind of thing so she brings a little bit,0.29667076
of import to proceedings that is a bit on the more humorous side like I,0.03271972
say very deadpan at the same time yes she just adds another dynamic to this,0.07106756
this core group of characters these two characters screenplay by John Michael Hayes is brilliantly,0.028262988
executed yeah just the way he pulls out particular characters and details and obviously the,0.12187694
way Hitchcock directs that on the screen it's just a beautiful marriage between director and,0.069318786
writer and obviously the actors as well I'm just bringing those details out and and,0.04529568
building up this picture of this world just outside your window yeah you know it's,0.052594077
one of the things that this film is about it's this idea that actually there,0.016646886
is this whole kind of system of life going on just outside your window you,0.03818154
can get caught up in the minutiae of of everyday life and never really notice,0.054305594
what's going on you have all these little stories going on inside these windows and,0.058120422
there are stories that kind of play out in such a way that it acknowledges,0.028205782
the fact you don't have the complete picture you know you can look into someone's,0.04816129
window you can see something happen and you can get the wrong idea you can,0.026317991
build a picture in your head of what is going on in that person's life,0.230967
and by the time we get to the end of this film we see that,0.030701552
in many of these cases that's not the case you know what you think was,0.021326452
happening or what Jimmy Stewart's character thought was happening isn't the case and I think,0.014691912
that's the way it is with life I think what it is saying ultimately is,0.028096028
that how much do we really know about our neighbors and how much are we,0.016678149
to blame for that you know we don't I think particularly today it's probably never,0.035800185
been more relevant this film because how many of us can truly claim to know,0.022139972
our next-door neighbors you know I think I think a lot of us know people,0.049139775
or within the online community better than we do our own neighbors so yeah I,0.021833988
think that's something that this film taps into long before social media which would probably,0.02801155
existed back then just not to the extent that it does now as with all,0.028856996
Hitchcock films is a pretty good dose of humor in here as well and it,0.055740394
really works it works very well and it's mainly down to Kelly and Stuart and,0.03487425
just they're in to play I totally believe in these characters the way they've brought,0.025005583
them to life and yeah I just really enjoy every moment of this journey going,0.1494182
along with these two people they feel like people I would like to know in,0.069716565
real life you know there's there's nothing about them that kind of makes me shut,0.2162359
down makes me turn enough and there has been in a few of Hitchcock's films,0.16532075
not here like I say they they make these central characters absolutely believable and absolutely,0.047677703
lovable and I think that's very important given the amount of time we're gonna spend,0.027884498
with them because we never really leave that apartment you know everything we see in,0.032404423
the outside world we see from that apartment so yeah you have to make these,0.020238878
guy these characters like especially Stewart's character and they succeed with that something else that,0.037759814
is really great about this film is the production design now that they built all,0.021539312
this block of apartments and many times throughout - you're looking at it you're seeing,0.05330183
the set and you're honestly you forget that you're watching a set this times when,0.023564795
you look at it and you like yeah it looks like location filming and you,0.05416524
have to remind yourself actually no it isn't this was all done studio every last,0.022368131
bit of it was built and it's just brilliant absolutely brilliant and if you look,0.04200435
at behind-the-scenes stuff on this they're the studio where they built this set they actually,0.022832429
took out the middle floor just so they could get that depth you know so,0.03539043
they could get like two or three floors worth of building on there so yeah,0.068842515
it is it is an amazing feat it must be said and the physicality of,0.069437854
it you know like these days you do something like this you probably employ CGI,0.04021434
you know to you need to kind of you get a little bit of the,0.054241735
stage and then you'd map the rest out with with computer graphics build it up,0.03915936
so to speak but here it's all real there's no green screen in that regard,0.028983383
and you just yeah you can feel it you feel like you can reach out,0.032494888
touch it and live with these people all these people that you're seeing in these,0.083080105
apartment blocks he's absolutely brilliant Hitchcock's direction is brilliant the way he like I said,0.039585743
the way he moves the camera across these blocks kind of focuses in on very,0.030749444
specific information giving us what we need to know just enough to keep us on,0.0319062
tenterhooks to keep us gripped with what's going on never knowing all the facts but,0.032673154
just enough to keep sucking in so yeah if there's one downside and this is,0.576201
very minimal really it is it's it's towards the end of the film and it's,0.02446612
the final confrontation between Jimmy Stewart's character and this guy it doesn't really play all,0.02148011
that well or believable these days you know Stewart uses his carrot his camera should,0.08783417
say the flash on his camera to kind of yeah push this guy back every,0.10484625
now and then just like phase in it's just to hold off his attack really,0.12964363
and the amount of times the sky falls for him without just saying you know,0.0390975
I'm going to close my eyes and come for you you're in a wheelchair how,0.2475153
you know how difficult is it going to be to subdue you yeah that doesn't,0.028755223
play too well by modern standards but like I say it's such a minor criticism,0.025956132
I I'm literally struggling there to to come up with that just so I've got,0.021811372
something to criticize neither not i thing you have to quit if somebody wanted to,0.031329483
yeah that's a little thing but for the most part I can understand why this,0.01952181
film is so loved by people it's still not my favorite film of 1954 I've,0.063026816
got to say upon the waterfront I love so much but yeah this definitely definitely,0.027949687
comes a very close second so yeah rear window I give it a 5 out,0.21939419
5 III think it's yeah really incredible piece of work and I strongly urge anyone,0.07305845
who hasn't seen it to go out and see it if you have seen rear,0.08438121
window then as usual I would like to know what you thought about it comment,0.022503162
