so this is a semi Chinese movie written and directed by a Lulu Wang and,0.07953402
I say semi Chinese because there is a fair bit of English in it too,0.10123962
and story here follows this young woman living in New York whose family decides to,0.036168694
fly back to China under the pretense of a wedding and she decides to join,0.09284833
them although the real reason for them going is something else entirely it's a bit,0.044601228
of a secret they're keeping and something they feel I could do more harm than,0.17213224
good if it got out so the movie basically follows this family as they have,0.021900507
a bit of a reunion and in the middle of it all is this young,0.05479118
woman who is a bit torn on the whole idea of keeping a secret she's,0.31121215
not convinced it's for the best but she doesn't want to go against her family,0.078934014
either that's the basic premise here and to be fair I was a little bit,0.039648935
underwhelmed by it mainly because I've heard a lot of good things about this one,0.028634826
it's been very well received but I'm not that convinced by it now don't get,0.01974531
me wrong this is by no means a bad movie in fact I liked it,0.054867674
but the story here was a bit underwhelming to me it's very very simple it's,0.09918221
all about this family and the secret they're keeping and that's it there's just nothing,0.04681629
more to it and it didn't feel like it really went anywhere either like your,0.035456285
plot itself almost feels non-existent it's just all about the characters and their whole family,0.019493872
dynamic it doesn't feel like anything really happens and it doesn't really go anywhere which,0.021283882
I guess could be fine but I didn't really even get the point though the,0.00907377
main characters are and her whole storyline about her life in New York and whatnot,0.018758845
and I don't think it's really dug into the other characters very much either it,0.0244894
does give most of them a little bit of depth they all feel unique and,0.033927027
different but that's about it they didn't really go very much deeper than that and,0.018457515
yeah at the end of the day I guess I just didn't really get the,0.017677255
point of it all I mean the movie is about family and about what people,0.038641848
do to protect their loved ones or what they think is protecting them even if,0.015058427
that means lying and deceiving and how they justify that to themselves and the people,0.076379046
around them but beyond that I just don't really know what I was supposed to,0.031863626
take away from this however as I said I still didn't like it it's still,0.045586366
a perfectly enjoyable movie I thought it was pretty funny at times too it's also,0.04371121
well act then the pacing wasn't bad either although it didn't really feel like it,0.014979935
went anywhere but it didn't drag or feel long so I guess it did something,0.020283446
right it's also a very good-looking a well-directed movie I also liked how they used,0.02057546
the music in this and thought the editing worked very well they utilized a lot,0.03211307
of hard cuts which can sometimes feel a bit abrupt but in this it worked,0.022481212
oh and the grand mind is is absolutely adorable I liked her a lot so,0.019408064
yeah beyond the story stuff and a general plot which I wasn't completely sold on,0.013827838
I did end up liking just about everything else and genuinely don't have any real,0.030797338
complaints about it and you know what it did have this certain charm to it,0.031141903
as well it's a very charming movie with a lot of heart and some touching,0.0489655
moments as well and I'm guessing that's really the reason so many people have liked,0.01698879
this as much as they have it's probably also most of the reason I didn't,0.017014733
really mind it either but did I personally think it's great no but it's most,0.030015746
definitely not bad either however would I recommend it sure I mean I think most,0.019783892
people will find something to like about it so you know maybe give it a,0.027076965
look or don't after all I'm not your dad but hey what are your thoughts,0.02832485
