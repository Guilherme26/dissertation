guys spend a long time coming Center hearts broken we've had our dreams crushed but,0.11983682
I am so happy to tell you that finally holy about time DC oh you,0.033983566
know I was going to wear this for my review but um it's just uh,0.036389537
yeah we're gonna just put put this back here yeah that'll do you can't even,0.09241064
see it anyways I word I have never I I'm struggling to form a sentence,0.023157703
that conveys how happy and excited I am right now okay it's like twelve o'clock,0.120814644
at night I've been up to six o'clock in the morning I have to wake,0.0937563
up at 6 o'clock tomorrow and I still have so much energy the adrenaline this,0.021130223
movie has given me so Wonder Woman newest installment of the DC franchise until now,0.06753809
a franchise that I thought was just slowly crashing actually very quickly crashing and burning,0.20383555
right before my eyes and to be honest I've given up all hope I saw,0.07286089
trailers for Wonder Woman I thought that looks pretty good kinda but I don't really,0.045452666
have that high hopes because every DC movie has just been terrible and everything Zack,0.07403427
Snyder touches sucks I know he didn't write or direct this one but he did,0.5871797
produce it so I was just like is go away but I just I couldn't,0.044925172
accept I couldn't get excited about this I wouldn't let myself do it because I,0.0463633
would not let another DC movie let me down just like the rest of them,0.063358076
but I am completely completely blown away what is happening where do I even begin,0.03579952
Gail gadot is okay so like when they first cast her for Batman V Superman,0.1580636
and everything I was like I don't really like this chick she's really scrawny she's,0.4650779
kind stick ish she doesn't have like the size you know the size the Wonder,0.0715711
Woman thighs shouldn't really have any muscle really she's just like this Victoria Secret model,0.22243409
looking girl don't get me wrong she is absolutely stunning beautiful but I just didn't,0.16465157
see that like Wonder Woman thing going on oh my god she is Wonder Woman,0.06677779
I'm convinced this woman is Wonder Woman she is an Amazon gal gadot Princess of,0.15821925
the Amazons daughter of Hippolyta born and raised in say mascara that's it that's Bessel,0.075173736
that's it nobody can tell me otherwise this chick is the most fierce badass incredible,0.30065382
woman I've ever seen in my life I think I'm in love she had so,0.1548195
much gusto and just balls brass balls but what I love about her performance and,0.29103804
just her character and the writing in general in this movie is that she's so,0.02617298
innocent and pure and just all she wants to do is help and save lives,0.036635656
and she has so much good in her and she's also just so cute because,0.02649626
like she's coming from say mascara and she doesn't really know what the world is,0.034569595
like she's never met a man before she's never seen anything outside of what she's,0.14943883
grown up with with the Amazons and so she's just walking around just like questioning,0.067768246
everything and admiring everything like a little girl and she's so adorable and naive she,0.21819155
asks so many funny questions and words things really weird please and Chris Pine is,0.013984156
just like okay yep and she's just like really blunt and innocent and just looking,0.14016949
around at the world loving every second of it and I'm just like oh I,0.07521365
just wanted squishy a little face then there's like war going on and she just,0.19495867
ripped off her clothes and has her Wonder Woman gear on underneath and she's just,0.1032518
like I'm not innocent I'm a badass she's like jumping on rooftops and punches through,0.42429498
walls slicing people in half and kicking them at the same time and I'm just,0.67963606
like how are you doing all this at once I can't even keep up with,0.03637224
what's happening right now and when that's happening she doesn't look innocent or modest or,0.043081284
anything at all she looks like she knows she's Wonder Woman she's like I'm the,0.10420102
man and there are times throughout this movie where she'll be like marching into battle,0.06334012
or like walking in slow motion into battle as she does a lot but didn't,0.01921649
like a really cool not overdone kind of voice and she has this like really,0.08170384
subtle smirk on her face which I love because for most of the movie she's,0.20119344
just like she's not trying to do it for herself she's trying to do it,0.051139317
for everyone else but when she's actually doing it she's like yeah I'm aware that,0.03984583
I'm the coolest person in the entire goddamn world I'm gonna kick some ass and,0.76393944
I'm just like yeah you are huh and then she rips up the frickin lasso,0.59704787
room I love the lasso of truth because they went straight-up comic-book cartoon with it,0.08609671
it's freaking a glowing piece of rope and it looks so cool I will say,0.6497496
some of the graphics we're not that great some of them were but some of,0.04755531
them were like I just forgot about them or something I don't know what happened,0.079009846
but there's some weird green-screen in this movie but honestly I'm not that mad about,0.035701737
it it's a superhero movie it's supposed to look kind of weird that honestly if,0.04644911
that's my only complaint from this whole movie is that some of the graphics weren't,0.012800129
100% that's it I can't believe I'm gushing about a DC movie I'm so happy,0.024873877
maybe maybe maybe there's hope guys maybe this isn't a flaming pile of garbage after,0.4537629
all just just maybe and I think what sets this movie apart from the other,0.035820805
movies and the DC franchise so much is the fact that this movie has heart,0.028259663
like so much heart not overbearing but just enough to make you care and to,0.027083617
make you root for the characters and to make you love every single character and,0.03447048
I think that's something that the DC Universe has struggled with because they just have,0.016918946
all these characters and they're just throwing them all in at once trying to create,0.25977194
character development and origin stories and all of that at once and they just can't,0.013537153
do that but in this movie they're just focusing on Wonder Woman and her like,0.04436509
ensemble and that you can work with that you can convey a really really good,0.031600215
story with really good characters with really good interaction Chris Pine I am in love,0.035588656
I mean I was I was in love with Chris Pine but I'm even more,0.045867737
in love with him now his character just had so much heart and it was,0.022046182
a different kind of heart than what Wonder Woman has and together they sort of,0.04419081
bounce their ideologies off of each other and it makes each of them better for,0.09140821
it and I'm in love with this man Steve you stole my heart you have,0.20584707
a lot of feelings and that's not one of the only reasons this movie is,0.029665194
so great this movie is a true origin story from beginning to end you see,0.04335068
Wonder Woman as a child as an adolescent as a woman and even after that,0.09615496
she's continually growing throughout the entire movie and it's believable it's not rushed it's not,0.055581413
too slow it's like the whole movie she's learning about herself and about the world,0.054919556
around her and about the people around her and about what she can do and,0.03897976
she's constantly training and challenging herself until the very end when she is just the,0.05114331
coolest so cool I'm in love with Wonder Woman I'm in love did I mention,0.09502015
the Wonder Woman is my favorite superhero of all time and if she isn't your,0.032897986
favorite superhero of all time go see this movie and I guarantee you will change,0.043984603
your mind I will say there was okay so at one point during the movie,0.07794755
I had this stop where I was like ah this is kind of a bad,0.068034984
quality that this movie has but then I thought about it and I realized I,0.044322517
was wrong and it's actually amazing but basically I was thinking that the villain of,0.0615082
this movie isn't really that exciting and I'm not really going to tell you who,0.03450374
it is because it's kind of like three villains sort of and none of them,0.09053149
are really that like whoa but the thing about this movie is that the villain,0.04301011
isn't really a character the villain is an idea it's a concept Wonder Woman is,0.04149748
fighting the concept of war and violence and she's also fighting herself as well as,0.23024689
the world around her and the people around her but essentially she's fighting the idea,0.05718584
of war and she's trying to combat it with love which sounds really corny and,0.22042923
cheesy and stupid but the movie puts it in a much much better words than,0.483338
what I'm saying right now and it's beautiful I ok I'm not like a cry,0.085761465
person like when I watch movies I don't usually cry I could probably name for,0.037835646
you like three movies off the top of my head that I've actually cried during,0.13749878
and I'll say I like teared up a little bit I didn't cry correct but,0.04566552
there were a significant amounts of liquid in my eyeballs during like at least four,0.080761276
different scenes during this movie like it's who it'll get you especially all of the,0.07212719
like subtleties about war and just soldiers in general there's so many just really small,0.06253258
tender moments and very subtle moments where just like this is an accurate representation of,0.020023359
war and how it affects people and how it traumatizes people and it is real,0.25383806
and it's amazing how well this movie portrays that without like shoving it in your,0.0796737
face and making you like terrified even though it is terrifying but I don't know,0.09066719
come on oh this movie just shows that beautifully you just got to see it,0.10428283
another thing I was worried about was the slow-motion anything Zack Snyder touches in any,0.072907455
DC movie that I've seen so far for some reason they just want to put,0.04458194
slow-motion in everything and I was worried they were going to do that in this,0.040751144
movie and they do but there's a but it's not really until the end of,0.018043771
the movie that you realize the reason that they're doing this is to show you,0.04091611
what things look like from Diana's perspective because she's like super fast like she's so,0.0452418
fat she's like the freaking flash so when there's action sequences where she's doing all,0.45414758
kinds of cool badass they put it in slow motion to show like her perspective,0.22479801
there's like bullets flying past her and she's just like slowly watching it and just,0.2722752
like this she's doing all these like spin split kick ninja things and they'll like,0.30838817
slow it down so it's all a that's my slow-motion interpretation and it is really,0.026995149
cool I don't I didn't really feel like it was that overdone I felt like,0.039045613
it was a tasteful amount of full motion and by the time you get to,0.02158787
the end of the movie you kind of realize why that's like I say often,0.06748554
but honestly this movie is so good it makes me so hopeful for the future,0.028574293
of DC and I'm so happy I don't understand how happy I am that we,0.0856404
finally have a good Wonder Woman movie oh my god I'm so happy ah and,0.042932946
it was directed by a woman just ban girl power patty Jenkins bah she's a,0.24748895
real Wonder Woman I got a second you patty Jenkins you rock you'll go Glen,0.062250547
Coco oh one more thing one last thing less about the movie more about the,0.0298275
franchise and justice league in particular okay so you know how like Marvel movies at,0.06059291
the very beginning they have the like Marvel logo where it's like like characters and,0.03341683
scenes and comics and they are like coming together and it's like Marvel you know,0.07403028
and talked about so the beginning of Wonder Woman there's a similar thing but for,0.031632144
DC and it's every single character from the Justice League it's Batman Superman Aquaman the,0.019592319
flash even cyborg but after they show all the Justice League characters it's only the,0.012441595
characters that are in the movie they show every single one in a row followed,0.024991615
by Green Lantern why is Green Lantern in this but every single character that is,0.008880867
in the movie even cyborg plus Green Lantern could it be that he is in,0.041365776
the movie my head's exploding I don't know about you so I'm really high this,0.16550568
is the first time I left a DC movie and thought I want to go,0.03421705
see that again in theatres possibly multiple times and I am definitely buying it on,0.0132019
blu-ray no doubt about it I have the theme song the one-woman theme song stuck,0.06972854
in my head you know like me a new knee knee knee knee knee that,0.107237585
kind of sounds like the Halloween theme when you sing it out loud oh one,0.08049786
fun fact that I think is pretty cool all of the Amazons are played by,0.018706959
like professional trained athletes and just badass women which i think is really cool just,0.319651
had to just had to put that out there oh I love women well that's,0.104757115
my review of Wonder Woman my very very excited exasperated review from Wonder Woman did,0.04775686
you see Wonder Woman let me know in the comments below what you thought about,0.024714233
it I would love to hear everything you have to say I would love to,0.047922492
