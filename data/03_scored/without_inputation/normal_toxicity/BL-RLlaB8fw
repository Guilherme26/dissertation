hey oh hey what's up,0.1429496
Bradley just want to take another look at you all right,0.093390055
Wow I really need to shave hey guys Carsten rehnquist year if you've been to any movie in the last few months you've probably seen the trailer for a little movie called a star is born this film was been getting a lot of buzz and it stars Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper who I believe also directed it it's a remake of the original 1977 film and it's been getting a lot of buzz like I just said so of course I had to see it now based on the trailer and the poster this really didn't seem like my type of thing it seemed more like a film for people that live in the suburbs who also have Waller above their leather couches that says live laugh love and thing is this movie is not at all like that,0.08026907
it's not at all what it was promoted as in my opinion,0.10196983
it seems like a story that's all about this woman's rise to fame,0.2766094
but at least to me it was more about this old country stars battle with addiction and alcoholism,0.09098072
it's actually a pretty heavy film that deals with some very dense subject matter,0.1492569
and I feel like it tackled,0.13561636
these subjects incredibly well my thing with a star is born' is that,0.14471579
it's essentially a few different movies these characters go through different stages of their lives and careers and with each stage comes a different movie to me and while some of these stages felt very consistent and good others didn't making the whole film in general feel a little messy,0.06758388
I guess I should address the first stage the the coming-up era which in my opinion was done the absolute best,0.07814375
I think this section of the film is almost flawless,0.040995143
it's amazing,0.06327286
there's really nothing to not enjoy about it,0.120775945
I loved the acting I loved the writing the pacing the cinematography all of it felt so fragile and careful and I loved how it was done,0.08870903
it was some of the most enjoyable and smoothest filmmaking I've seen all year but then as Ally our main character started to get bigger and her relationship with Jack seemed to get a bit more complicated similar to the characters the film got really out of control whereas in the first section the film really had a clear grasp on what these characters wanted and who they were throughout the remainder of the film they seemed to lose that grasp as each character seemed to separate further from each other,0.06861774
it felt like they took a lot of time to craft those first 30 minutes and then seemed to rush the rest of the film to me the heart of this was the editing,0.07232785
I felt like the editing was super awkward and rushed,0.23991956
it's very clear that there were scenes that they really wanted to hold on and focus on but due to time constraints they probably had to cut them down,0.10943407
the movie is already 2 hours and 13 minutes as is so it would not surprise me if they wanted to cut this thing down for the sake of selling more tickets this film,0.17048346
at one point would spend like 20 seconds on a certain location and then move on to the next and repeat that over and over again,0.07115308
but it wasn't like a montage,0.107124515
that's just how the film went it made a very smooth and kind of calm drama feel way more chaotic and fast-paced than it needed to be a clear example of this is when Jack proposes to Ali out of nowhere,0.08491933
it was like the weirdest edit,0.100945
I saw this year it was just so fast and awkward and uncomfortable the whole audience was just like wait what my last major flaw with the film it would be how many different times it ended you think it's over and then it's not and then it keeps going and then they build it up into the ending and then you're like oh this is not the ending and then it repeats that over and over and over again the issue here is that on paper,0.10394311
this isn't actually that bad of an ending it actually kind of makes sense it was just pasted and edited so awkwardly to make you feel like it was coming to an end,0.10632046
when in reality you still have like 20 minutes left,0.14998335
I will say the film did have a lot going for it,0.03981338
though the clear highlight that a lot of people are talking about is the acting,0.05917888
everybody is talking about how amazing Lady Gaga is,0.10467507
and yeah they're right,0.044498056
she killed it especially for someone who has limited to no acting experience,0.6632467
but in my opinion,0.06451758
I think Bradley Cooper did just as good if not better he destroyed,0.44435441
this performance,0.08208314
I mean I mean like maybe the best of the year he totally became this character in a really dark way that left me at the edge of my seat also that sweet southern accent I mean oh I hear a lot of people complaining about the cinematography of the film and to be honest,0.06581356
I kind of disagree a lot of the shots are very claustrophobic there are either mediums or close-ups,0.1666574
and I think this really enhances the feel that this film is going for,0.08394599
it's really not a controlled environment that these characters are living in and while the tight editing didn't do much for me this claustrophobic cinematography really worked,0.07066258
and of course I can't really talk about this film without mentioning the music specifically shallow which is basically already won the Oscar for Best Original Song it was great,0.08371688
it gave me goosebumps I listened to it on the way home not much to say that hasn't already been said overall a star is born was basically built to win Oscars,0.117278054
but I can't really complain,0.049274098
I think it'll deserve every nomination and or win that it gets read Lee Cooper will get a Best Actor nomination Lady Gaga will get a Best Actress nomination and as we all know shallow,0.1021624
would you know yada yada yada but to be honest I'm not too upset about it,0.094186746
I think it definitely deserves these,0.10057359
it's a powerful film that definitely deserves the hype,0.074490875
it's been getting even though it's a little messy and overstays its welcome just a tad I'm gonna give a star is born' a 3.5 out of 5,0.11521007
thank you all so much for watching,0.050267864
and I will see you guys,0.19114004
in the next one,0.055549882
