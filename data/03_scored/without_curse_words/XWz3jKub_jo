well that broke my heart what is up flick fans and welcome back to my,0.071230434
channel today we are talking about one of my most anticipated movies of the last,0.06668442
couple of months it finally came to a theater near me we are talking the,0.06701285
farewell I need your comments down below did you enjoy this movie let's talk about,0.24193057
it so a Chinese family discovers their grandmother has only a short while left to,0.18558142
live and decide to keep her in the dark scheduling a wedding together before she,0.11798047
dies and oh my goodness a 24 one of my favorite Studios out there you,0.56086075
delivered an emotional gut punch a movie that handles atmosphere and tone I think better,0.2351408
than anything I have seen all year and one that broke me I said this,0.069023594
on Twitter I normally tweet out reviews right after I see the movie I had,0.07428474
to sit back and wait for about 30 minutes and just kind of ponder on,0.0724888
what I just watched not because there is a lot to soak in and think,0.08436895
about all what happened here and here the story is very simple it's all about,0.06609775
a family who comes together to basically celebrate their grandmother without telling her why they,0.118105225
are there to celebrate it's all covered up by this wedding and that really is,0.034076888
it's the premise of this movie it carries out until the end and like I,0.060653184
said this is just such an emotional experience if you have ever lost a loved,0.15589923
one if you have ever had a grandmother or grandfather in particular who was a,0.13479823
major part of your lives then maybe they begin to lose their memory or they,0.30682158
get cancer or something happens that normally happens to people that reach that age and,0.35027236
are maybe not in the best of health or maybe they are in the best,0.150732
of health but they get to that point in their lives and your body it,0.15892208
just continues to wither down as you get older and when you hit that age,0.35848528
that's when hearts begin to break and things start to happen to your loved ones,0.09616617
and listen here's one of the reasons why I felt the way that I felt,0.10192931
about this movie I'll get into all of the brilliance of the filmmaking here in,0.15318944
just a second but just a personal story so my grandmother who I grew up,0.07790267
with and I saw basically every weekend of my life for 10 to 12 years,0.15147865
last year she was put in a nursing home because she had a health scare,0.23861483
she got dementia and she fell all those things kind of added up to the,0.46286443
fact that she had to leave her home go into that nursing home she's about,0.20371008
three hours away from me right now and it feels like every time I go,0.086089745
to see her I lose a bit more of her and my entire family feels,0.27123028
the same way and it comes down to the most recent time when we saw,0.07716865
her she had trouble recognizing me she had trouble recognizing my wife my dad calls,0.38568833
she doesn't know which brother it is it's just a very it's a complicated situation,0.15019868
and the entire time I was watching this movie I felt what awkwafina's character felt,0.09052174
in this situation it is a different situation from hers because in this movie she,0.09050051
has cancer and the cancer is so bad it's at a stage to where they,0.16851866
don't think they can really do anything about this and they decide to keep that,0.09317324
from her so she's all happy and giddy and just excited to see everyone her,0.3001021
her whole family is finally gathered back from America from here from there everyone is,0.14748685
here right and then you have Aquafina who is the one that is struggling the,0.12063835
most with not telling her what is actually wrong with her this is a Chinese,0.37673965
tradition and one thing I loved about this movie is how it handled traditions traditions,0.06339553
from families in general gathering around the dinner table talking laughing joking around those things,0.06524009
you love doing when you go and you visit your family whether it's a brother,0.122724675
a sister a grandma a cousin whatever it is I have that with my family,0.18140088
but they partook in all of those things and while that was going on you,0.09206589
see it kind of fluster in the back of everyone's head it starts out just,0.25976306
aquafina she's the only one that's kind of freaking out then it slowly transfers to,0.4922019
everyone else in the situation and to see that progress and to see even the,0.044971775
people who at the beginning of the movie were like we can't tell her no,0.10307408
matter what we do by the end of the film they're sitting back going I,0.053871337
don't know I it's a confliction that I saw progressing every single character and there,0.076342285
was not a bad performance I had no issue with the script when it came,0.05407872
to side characters dialogue from her parents to her actual grandma to her grandma sister,0.18550634
to her uncle's to her aunts the conversations every thing it led towards developing each,0.16994914
and every character and even the characters who maybe I didn't know their name you,0.05132602
could still see the emotion within them especially when everything comes to the head at,0.07675075
the end of the movie the eventual wedding not spoiling anything because it's in the,0.1143187
trailer but yeah it's just a story that I think is going to rock a,0.050773133
lot of people to their core especially if you can relate to it in some,0.06666517
way and it doesn't have to be a grandparent it can really be anyone in,0.096517675
your family or a friend you can connect with this situation now let's get into,0.06767928
the filmmaking because that's the reason listen if all of that stuff that I just,0.08426756
talked about worked really well I would say yeah I like this movie a lot,0.10890812
I enjoyed it but you pair that with this filmmaking the cinematography it felt like,0.15036999
every shot had a purpose everything was laid out so well and I know there's,0.15965602
a lot of hype around the farewell and I it's got a nine and an,0.08357093
around tomatoes it's gonna be eight listen I kind of bought the hype I'm like,0.08466972
yeah this could be really good I didn't expect it to hit me I didn't,0.10889923
anticipate getting emotional in the theater and I did I got emotional I sat back,0.046949714
at the end and watched every ounce of credits without saying a word moving touching,0.06756288
my phone anything I just sat and soaked it all in because it was such,0.09687054
an emotional experience and Aquafina everyone in this movie is good they carry their weight,0.08765368
they bring in the emotion and it's so funny because all this movie is it's,0.092780046
just a lot of conversation it's a lot of learning about this family and the,0.038425412
struggle that they have with each other the struggle that they have with decisions that,0.06693084
they made in the past and the struggle that they have with this particular decision,0.04222989
that's all the movie is so if you're expecting action or adventure or something crazy,0.27745777
or Aquafina to jump off of a building you're not gonna get that the farewell,0.26288617
is exactly what you think it's going to be it's just executed in the best,0.49391767
way possible and back to Aquafina who is magnificent I mean right now possibly one,0.15268373
of my favorite performances of the year she is broken when she needs to be,0.09018092
broken she is incredibly incredibly emotional on a level that I didn't anticipate I know,0.3427888
she's funny she's done funny before and she's done it well this is something else,0.19262277
this is something that I didn't think I would see out of her she is,0.15442833
magnificent and that mixed with this script mixed with the direct by lulu Wang who,0.1620809
first time making a movie hopefully this is not the last time I hope you,0.18060336
get every opportunity from here on out a wonderful job incredibly slick direction awesome cinematography,0.18111232
with the score and the score was just haunting in a sense and when they,0.081020616
took away the score from certain scenes and you just sit there in silence and,0.1956095
wonder with the characters what is going to happen next it just felt so real,0.047048323
it kind of felt like at times watching a documentary of a family that's experiencing,0.097973846
a trouble like this and because of all of those things coming together mixed with,0.16096926
the a24 package so you know it's going to be an artistic film and yes,0.060413804
it is a bit artistic but I do think this is an artistic film that,0.1460481
is family-friendly it's only PG but it's family-friendly and heartbreaking and emotional and it is,0.04425439
a crowd-pleaser all of these thing I mean how rare is it that you get,0.2406217
a movie this crowd-pleasing yet its artistic and wonderfully made and the farewell for me,0.10620591
is just it's a great move it is a great movie one of the best,0.06173106
movies I have seen all year and one of my absolute favorites I have to,0.03661014
go you know what I was planning on going somewhere with my score I'm going,0.1278001
even higher I'm going 96% for the farewell one of the highest scores I have,0.03768593
given all year I place it on my list I'm actually gonna move it up,0.087215096
a bit higher because I the more I think about this movie more I get,0.15405115
emotional the more that I absolutely love it I feel the same way I felt,0.10209992
about eighth grade last year a 24 movie I walked out of that film feeling,0.07739438
emotional happy entranced this movie wasn't feeling as happy but it does end on a,0.09030142
note that makes you smile sit back and go I need to call my grandmother,0.29442012
and tell her that I love her or just a family member in general so,0.0753453
