true story I was super excited that you guys - dude thank you for watching,0.114899255
I'm very appreciative this is my first film movie review of the wonderful fantastic film,0.043496963
us anyway what are you talking about yes us which is written and directed and,0.06586046
produced by the amazing Jordan Peele this is his second film on his first was,0.08557776
get out if you have not seen that I highly recommend checking that out this,0.15923125
film runs about two hours and one minute for me I felt that going into,0.06481234
it I was like that's a half an hour too long like it should be,0.088328265
a clean hour and a half but watching it twice I felt that it is,0.034530926
a perfect amount of time and this story doesn't flounder at all it's very straightforward,0.06955252
everything's needed and it's a nice good two hours of your time um so tell,0.11235294
you a little bit about what the film is without giving these for e-alerts even,0.20912737
though I would love to really discuss that there is a twist and all of,0.08590461
the other things that go along with that I really just want people to go,0.08086596
in there with an open mind and so yeah this story starts off with this,0.043214634
beautiful dark-skinned african-american family going to taking a vacation trip to Santa Cruz which is,0.6437932
so cool to see like a black people on of each like can we just,0.5526573
meet us about that they taking this vacation with their family and they meet their,0.052194968
doppelganger family that looks just like them and that is when things go awry and,0.12998983
the wonderful cast is Lupita Nyong'o wants to do shoddy right to Joseph and Evan,0.26671803
Alex I'm looking at my notes guys just to make sure I got everything right,0.103104904
they also meet up with their friends played by Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidegger I,0.037180137
pronounced sorry about pronouncing his blessing wrong I just want to say before I really,0.14442658
get started to review this film is that this is my first movie review and,0.0632523
the reason why I decided to do this was because as a child I used,0.10817572
to watch Roger Ebert's reviews or he would do the thumbs-up or thumbs-down and I,0.09243896
was the nerdy kid who like loved that I was obsessed with it like I,0.55527973
just really liked watching what these two men had to say about movies and it's,0.14985748
funny because I never perceive myself as being able to critique movies I mean I,0.13737722
did go to film school and but like who am I to discuss movies but,0.086304314
I'm like I want to be a part of the conversation and I think it's,0.0657415
super important I'm very passionate about filmmaking in films and I just really want films,0.05939645
to be attainable and digestible for audiences I feel like sometimes there can be a,0.0522878
loftiness even the fact that I'm calling them films in that movie it's really annoying,0.18995918
to me but um films and don't have to be scary and the honest trip,0.112879984
is like we can learn from ourselves about them and we can learn about the,0.07391458
world through films and they're just a super powerful tool that is used in our,0.07252427
society and it can be enjoyable they can be escapism and they can be dreadful,0.3744161
and they can be really bad sometimes you're like why did I waste an hour,0.24132018
and a half but what can I learn from that you know um so without,0.09246168
further ado that is why I started this and I'm so excited to talk about,0.08338272
movies with you guys and hear what you guys think about the movies that are,0.07419021
coming out overall score for the film is four scissors out of four scissors and,0.057090744
that's because the cinematography the editing the actors performances the script the score which is,0.055092365
the music that is playing along with the film was all just a beautiful weeping,0.085456036
I would say of a classic horror film um I going into it I knew,0.18553518
it was a horror film because Jordan Peele had tweeted being like this is a,0.1280049
horror film and I was like okay like this is not get out you know,0.21402869
and which was I would argue is a social thriller and I was ready for,0.15130128
that as a second film to get out it stands on its own as a,0.090330034
film it tells an interesting story that I haven't seen and it doesn't in a,0.061570287
like it's not he doesn't do it in a showy way you know some directors,0.11337922
are just he's not at that point as his career where there there like I,0.09131867
have to have the shot because I get to do it but he's still at,0.16277085
the point where it's like does this serve the story and of course that may,0.0669296
happen later in his career and that's okay like I think all directors have to,0.09512921
kind of take that path but right now he's being super authentic to what he,0.08698143
wants to say as a filmmaker and you can see it in the film like,0.05742319
it's it's very obvious the monologues he also wrote the script so the monologues lupita,0.102394834
that's a couple monologues in the film and they're just so beautifully written and so,0.04944204
beautifully performed and that is a Lupita's bringing her a-game in this but be the,0.07067082
director like you can't you can't deny that he like put his work into it,0.22715679
as well and his vision so it's super exciting to see you guys I mean,0.107791394
I was scared out of my mind when the movie ended I like turned on,0.1327788
all the lights when I came home and and did not sleep so well but,0.08860863
as a film it's people the second rating that I'll give that I think is,0.09950922
really important for movies is honest performance so I'm going to give that forces its,0.067155994
out of force is yours what another really good skill the performances I think are,0.115422435
honest for me and honest performance is when I see an actor give and what,0.05657774
I mean by that is my boss Catherine describes it in a really cool way,0.06764945
it worked like I have a ball and I'm gonna throw it at you and,0.5928878
it's just pass and that's what acting is it's just passing the ball and you,0.18109101
can see what actors do that really well when they're giving and you can see,0.07077803
when they're not doing it well this film Lupita Nyong'o oh praise be the heavens,0.15409133
that's my song of worship church but no but in all seriousness she gave like,0.15197147
um I was talking to my sister about this and she was just at this,0.1836085
place where she did her work like she went so dark and I would I,0.17102124
would argue that it was a place of pain that she went to and I,0.20687568
don't know where she called that from but you clearly see that on the screen,0.12218923
and it's haunting like it's one of the most haunting performances I've ever seen her,0.16129023
actors and from her personally was a beautiful performance so good job and the kids,0.075780734
were also really amazing kid actors can be difficult to work with and kid actors,0.06130169
who both have to play themselves and their counterparts the doppelganger is so the fact,0.07208856
that they did that in such a beautiful way also applies to Jordan because he,0.092499614
got that out of them but also cause the kids because they were giving in,0.09512798
their performances the only thing that I will say the twins that play like Elizabeth,0.17482589
Lucis mas has her family and she has two twins they were the only people,0.08418478
that I noticed were a little not with it and then this third thing I'll,0.10125901
score this film on is diversity in front of and behind the camera what that's,0.107993856
a category we're gonna score on that yes we is yes we is I would,0.06499128
give it for it for what is this a perfect film I have a Guinness,0.0698927
and the reason I'm going to do that is because in front of the camera,0.11727473
our cast is completely african-american black whatever you want to call yourself that is a,0.58856654
huge deal not only that I think Jordan is a beautiful job of casting dark-skinned,0.60456526
um african-american people and that's super important because many times light-skinned actors are favored and,0.47882074
so to see a dark-skinned family like I said on the screen not talking about,0.63778305
slavery was a beautiful beautiful thing thank you Charlie so yes diversity in front of,0.4651128
was amazing another thing I want to say as diversity behind the cameras I think,0.11113135
that just if not it's just as important and Michael Abel's also apologized to them,0.054265775
pronouncing your last name wrong the composer was african-american which is amazing the score is,0.35229602
one of the most beautiful scores and haunting sports I've ever heard I mean it,0.08156689
just if you don't like or just listen to the soundtrack like it's that good,0.15385361
Jordan of course counts for all of the above line basically and that's really what,0.0708418
I'm doing here for the diversity also you guys forget on the camera I don't,0.11557071
know how diverse their costume department was ordered you know I could go a tiny,0.13188457
pre-pro and really dig into it and that's maybe what I'll do in future but,0.102012016
right now I'm just gonna stick with the above-the-line who was diverse about there and,0.06841165
then also in front of the camera um so pretty good on diversity standards so,0.07411222
my overall review again for four I will say that you should I would highly,0.18325798
recommend doing Roger Ebert to thumbs-up to go see this film it is a horror,0.29112172
film it scary so if you're not down with that do not see it but,0.10714026
I also don't like I'm not huge on horn but I knew that this was,0.102528565
important for me to see this film and I kind of just had to get,0.08718196
over it and build a bridge and get over uhm and go see it I,0.15019113
will say without giving spoilers the film deals with really interesting topics of privilege of,0.050636705
the Forgotten of judgment and honestly dealing with this dialogue that I think we're having,0.084060654
in our country of us versus them and it's something that he does in such,0.16277029
a it's such an interesting and intricate and not heavy-handed way get out was super,0.09980004
clear it was like this is America and this is what we're dealing with and,0.089754045
this was like this is America but let's let's do what that and a more,0.08964313
you had to chew through it like you had a really munch on this it,0.40309715
wasn't so clear I think I mean it was clear for me but you know,0.12859175
everyone's gonna perceive it differently of what he's talking about and I love that like,0.06566274
seeing in a second time I was like oh this clue oh this clue as,0.0749906
a filmmaker that's like I mean that's gold to be able to see it I'm,0.08042778
filming a second time and like look at how he did this shot and look,0.20896426
at what that t-shirt says in the background and looking what that kid said on,0.09804409
the beach like everything he just like dropping it and it's just beautiful to munch,0.31224516
on and I'm still honestly munching on this movie it's a weird word to use,0.152704
to describe a film but it's satisfied Jordan what he's doing is giving african-americans a,0.31089434
space to be in the horror genre which i think is really amazing and very,0.15260132
cool because I never saw my myself reflected in horror and not until get out,0.14395495
I was like oh this is a drummer that's exciting and cool and that I,0.06880694
could be a part of and honestly I'm just excited to see what he does,0.07184284
next so goes to the movie thank you guys so much for watching thanks for,0.048881683
watching based on a true story remember that your story is important so go out,0.064018294
