my least favorite genre ever! I find them incredibly cliched and forced and really convenient,0.10956639
when it came to problems in a relationship and how they overcame obstacles. But what's,0.030789355
great about this movie is that it takes a long time to build up the,0.035043206
two of them as individuals before building up them as a couple. Marianne and Eloise,0.07144139
are two women who believe that it's best to be independent and try to control,0.07393516
"every aspect of their lives as much as they can. And oddly enough, that's the",0.062097553
reason they clash at first because one of them fights for what's theirs out loud,0.098974004
in public while the other one is nonetheless kind of content with accepting the fact,0.03577956
that there will be hardships in life. But after not only do they spend more,0.04374314
"time with each other but with this live-in maid named Sophie, the two of them",0.03385984
bond slowly over time and realized that they do kind of have to accept the,0.028016204
fact that people are not always gonna give you what they want especially in the,0.0257905
time period that they're in where there are just some things that they should have,0.02054087
control over but no one will let them have it. And as they spend more,0.029812865
"time together, they progressively switch roles to see who's more forgiving and accepting and who's",0.038498834
more cynical and that was the biggest surprise in regards to the romance side of,0.10536177
the movie. But the reason that it works so much as everyone has been saying,0.028514428
is the direction! Almost every shot really does look like a painting and the cinematographer,0.04862692
accomplishes this a lot by framing three or four different shots in one take and,0.046012748
they each adjust as actors move from one location to another. And it gives each,0.01640343
take a subtle amount of energy without giving you too much coverage but it also,0.030975606
allows the actors to play out their parts as uninterrupted as possible and because you're,0.113298066
"already so invested to what's happening on screen, the more time they're allowed to just",0.011389274
"play the part, the more time you just sit there wondering ""What's gonna happen next""?",0.018857291
And there's also- One of the biggest surprises was the fact that there's a real,0.017304752
lack of music and more of an emphasis on sound effects in order to create,0.04323627
atmosphere. There like three scenes that feature music and none of them come from a,0.04479413
"soundtrack, if there's any music it's because there's an instrument in the area and someone's",0.04579989
playing it. That's about it. But when another scene goes by where person is all,0.020108502
"alone, and you hear a fire playing in the background or hear echoing footsteps, it",0.066431224
just makes you feel completely alone and isolated just like the characters are. As much,0.013919633
"as the two women switching from who's the more forgiving and who's the more cynical,",0.23437886
"there is one argument that kind of feels a little out of left field, mostly",0.02526168
because that character had never really lashed out at anyone before and the other one,0.04697793
