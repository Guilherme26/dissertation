hi I'm a mandrill and today I will be reviewing director Guillermo del Toro's 2017,0.033911727
movie the shape of water it's basically the story of a mute woman who works,0.16737351
in janitorial services and at her job she encounters a nonhuman entity will just say,0.04720742
that and a relationship build between the two some would call it a modern-day beauty,0.030094903
and the beast' del toro style or you could also say cutie and The Creature,0.057749912
from the Black Lagoon because that's more accurate I heard about the movie I was,0.09654209
not intrigued I wasn't interested it kind of looks like Pan's Labyrinth and that rid,0.041468214
didn't really get me excited this director definitely has a style of his own and,0.030879155
it's not a style that's really me but after watching the Oscars and seeing mr.,0.028648794
del Toro clean up I thought okay fine maybe I should give this movie a,0.07312364
chance maybe it's actually good well once again this is not for me just gonna,0.055687845
say overall it's very Pan's Labyrinth II in the visuals and the story is also,0.013895687
kind of Hellboy meets Beauty and the Beast meets well as I said The Swamp,0.096307285
Thing Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Aquaman to a certain extent I don't know,0.049530905
I had a really a hard time buying into the premise and going with it,0.02557498
just so much was like uncomfortable I liked the arrow we're in we're in I,0.036558494
don't know if it's the 50s the 40s I like the music they used from,0.06993209
earlier times and they have a lot of vintage TV movie clips in the movie,0.029702445
and when I saw that you know black and white clips I knew okay well,0.086212456
there you go that's why it went in Oscar because there's a trend with the,0.015389023
Oscars that I've noticed every movie that has a love for the cinema or an,0.023974549
ode to cinema and film and it portrays some kind of old movie in it,0.018154193
or embodies an old style those movies usually win Oscars okay yeah it made a,0.07943424
nod to the past it acknowledged its history but does that mean it deserves an,0.022664802
Oscar just because it feels timeless the performances are good I wasn't blown away by,0.020319365
anyone in particular Michael Shannon was I mean he plays Michael Shannon at this point,0.025869656
I don't know if he's typecast or he gravitates towards roles that put him in,0.10489746
this position where he is just a villain or very intense creepy scary Sally Hawkins,0.10608881
as a mute had to do a lot of facial expressions and body acting she,0.17416504
did a good job she really did they tried to set up this relationship between,0.029407104
her and I guess her neighbor or caretaker played by Richard Jenkins but I don't,0.017149765
know I didn't see it I felt like this movie wants us to believe oh,0.0155792665
these two go way back and they have a relationship but I really did not,0.03421705
get that even Octavia Spencer's character felt very theatrical with the fast-talking and the always,0.013495911
blabbering because you know oh you have the nude girl of course she's gonna be,0.4836249
friends with the girl who can't stop talking because she just needs somebody to listen,0.22840002
to her it feels like a trope it feels like something a little bit obvious,0.11663463
I don't know it felt theatrical but I think that's what Guillermo goes for he,0.021184104
goes for something kind of big and showy he's telling a fairy tale and you're,0.047627147
often reminded that this is very much fantastical and not grounded in any reality but,0.013737373
I still feel like he aims for reality that's why I'm mentioning it but maybe,0.019804513
I'm completely wrong maybe he just wants us to be in fantasy world and forget,0.06474698
about reality forget about how unnatural people are how people talk how people interact with,0.05507654
one another he just inspires himself in real life but then Chuck's it all out,0.08469318
the window my gosh this movie gave me huge Amelie Pula Amelie Amelie vibes that's,0.14142203
one of my favorite movies I haven't seen it a long time as a teenager,0.027790707

Emily music with the accordion and everything very Emily quirky love story very Emily Richard,0.033998866

and her world and how she views the world and it's interesting talk about the,0.034761168
best soundtrack ever in cinema shout out to yanti erson amazing so one of the,0.031337466
elements that is really showy and extra is the village he has all the things,0.016934246
that a villain has he's racist a supremacist a religious fanatic he's an idiot he's,0.7303742
gross like wash your hands ill and what he develops a mute fetish after he,0.6841587
meets Eliza like he's power-hungry and insecure and oh just too much too much for,0.06946779
me and we see this kind of rotten personality is portrayed and symbolism it's all,0.17642932
I'm gonna say I don't want to spoil it no pun intended I say this,0.03741525
movie is pg-13 I don't know what its labels got some mature scenes in there,0.02150073
- it's got some violence more than I thought it would have it's kind of,0.111961715
visually striking so yeah I don't think it's for children no no and the female,0.16487707
character at times kind of feels written by a man but I don't know I,0.05983992
don't know all women so I can't speak but every morning in the tub really,0.22402814
hey apparently this woman is exceptional and unusual and it's a fantasy character when did,0.11363266
she learn to tap dance I had questions why eggs exclusively it's not kind of,0.06416694
bad for your diet and then you have the fish dude you know no sorry,0.07957326
I know no I don't love fish I eat fish now he's not really a,0.019431345
fish fine he's not that far removed but he's not they mentioned that he might,0.057459895
be some kind of South American godlike creature Oh God no he seemed to be,0.107264854
very much mortal and always on the brink of death I would say maybe he's,0.20585771
an x-men character you know he's a mutant he is a very more realistic portrayal,0.101827644
of what you would expect Aquaman to be but hot no girl no no I'll,0.27332768
tell you what she was into the Mavs is what she was into I mean,0.07547307
shape of water hawk you know what I'm saying I don't know it was really,0.020363932
hard for me to buy into their evolving relationship insecurities much she makes a speech,0.04897814
at some point about feeling like an outsider feeling alone and deficient as a human,0.15021376
being but when he looks at her or when she's with him she feels completely,0.02129519
just sounds like you've got major insecurity issues and what you are so dissatisfied with,0.05999624
who are that a human man could never be into you you have to go,0.14969027
and find your mate in the fish world this is not the beginning of a,0.031691343
healthy relationship I had compassion for him as a living being a creature I was,0.18745008
like yes it's unfair that he is in this tank that he was stolen that,0.058633942
he was brought to this place to be researched and poked and prodded and mistreated,0.0654707
yes I can have compassion for him on that level but as a love interest,0.027971638
as a human being I have my limits and I found them through this movie,0.041677747
and it felt at time like they were trying to equate or some kind of,0.023103824
metaphor between racism and fish ISM I don't know I'm not saying that that's what,0.107250884
they were going for but it felt like they were leaning on oh just because,0.022219794
it doesn't look like you you hate him they brought up racism in the movie,0.26566872
they brought up homophobia in the movie they brought up just hating of people that,0.425778
aren't conventional to society in ways that I thought were kind of obvious and just,0.03390308
too direct either I have seen way too many movies about injustice and discrimination and,0.04085425
I'm just fed up with it or it just kind of felt like a plot,0.06095211
device and emotional manipulation almost to a certain extent ah now you're supposed to hate,0.09162772
this character and have sympathy for this character and that's how you're gonna love the,0.017853528
team of misfits that we're putting together for you the end end is somewhat predictable,0.1423739
not super predictable but when they show Eliza has a certain characteristic in her childhood,0.085100934
you can kind of expect the movie to go in a certain direction especially at,0.035342537
the end and that's what we get Oh cute creative who know this movie just,0.031268954
felt like a spoof of lala land the romantic scenes the moments where we leave,0.0885253
this reality now we're in a dance sequence tab dancing etc I don't want to,0.01881738
say too much but there's a whole Russian storyline to this movie that I felt,0.11864016
was unnecessary I didn't see how it added anything it was violent for violence sake,0.041647147
the character involved in that storyline could have been integrated in another way and would,0.009833409
have served his purpose just as well my advice would be if they're gonna do,0.028937483
a sequel Marvel should snatch this movie up talk to your man Toro and turn,0.2576391
this into the blueish green or teal Panther and we can have Wakanda in South,0.037884206
America call it El Dorado I mean that's kind of what makandal was referred to,0.08862774
as and in the end the creature could just be a guy in a suit,0.12206652
and we see him you know exit the waters and is if it off and,0.030825276
it's just William Levy under all of that mmm that would kill audiences you're welcome,0.16262609
Marvel I will accept some royalty fees thank you I think I said what I,0.078353316
had to say about shape of water it's not for me if you like del,0.05183111
Toro movies if you like Beauty and the Beast the concept if you're not averse,0.09459909
to bestiality if you're into a mini pool on the movie in la-la land even,0.17369874
to a certain extent if you even like Finding Nemo watch this movie cinema for,0.051338207
the graphics not so necessary at home sure more of a home movie I would,0.036905054
say but why he won all those Oscars I'm sorry it's beyond me as I,0.025780523
said I think it's just because he referenced old movies and they're just like oh,0.069936745
look my grandfather was in this movie we should give him the Oscar just kidding,0.009956469
