[Music] so for the june 2020 great film throwback day we're going to be talking about one of the most iconic films of all time and that of course is the 1944 directed film by billy wilder double indemnity starring an iconic cast including fred mcmurray barbara stanwyck and the great edward g robinson so you guys know about me and you know a lot about my passion towards film as well as my wanting to be the true great film appreciator that i am which is why this segment on my channel was born a couple of years back but something that you may not hear me talk about a lot is my love for billy wilder to me guys he truly is my stanley kubrick there are certain directors that when i hear their names and that they're directing a new movie i am going to do my very best to make sure that i go and see that movie directors names like quentin tarantino martin scorsese christopher nolan david fincher those are some of the big names in today's world that really get my heart pumping and get me excited to go to the theaters but when it comes to some of the most iconic films especially from the golden age of hollywood billy wilder is the name that makes my heart sing now i know that he has a lot more films to his name than stanley kubrick and i still have not seen a great deal of them but i am proud to say that now that i have seen double indemnity i think i may have seen his four greatest films that he has ever made i have seen sunset boulevard which is an incredible film very very haunting the apartment which is also a best picture oscar winner starring jack lemmon and shirley maclaine one of the most charming and beautiful films that i've ever seen in my life i am a proud owner of that one as well as the american film institute's greatest comedy of all time also starring jack lemmon and the great tony curtis some like it hot i gotta tell you guys if you have never seen some like it hot that is a movie that you must see you will be laughing your heads off but double indemnity i also have to be a little ashamed of myself because i had no idea that billy wilder directed this film so bad law known bad so i wanted to make sure that i got the chance to see this film and i gotta say if there's one thing that i love so much about billy wilder as a director is he can take the most mundane things and just with some good acting an amazing score and even some very interesting styles of dialogue and body language he could turn something like insurance sales into something that is truly dark and a true thrilling matter so this is the story of a man named walter neff who is going to renew a policy for a man's trucking company and he meets with his wife phyllis diedrichson who is played by barbara stanwyck and the two of them just create this incredible yet dark bond of passion between each other and walter decides that he wants to help this woman get out of her mundane marriage even though she really is living in the lap of luxury by secretly taking out an accidental insurance policy on her husband and then try and find a way to off this guy so she can get the double indemnity clause and then the two of these people can go and run off together but after the deed is done there seems to be a bit of doubt in regards to the cause of this man's death and was it in fact planned for the sake of collecting the money especially when we take a look at edward g robinson's character mr keys who happens to be walters boss and how he and other people are slowly trying to peel back the layers of this specific situation and realize this may not be what it seems and because of that it is eating up walters inside because he knows that he made a mistake and he did it out of passion and not out of reason but the most important thing about this story is that when you take a look at while his layers are being healed back you see the layers of mrs dedrickson being pulled back and then you're gonna truly see who is the truly good-natured person and who is the true villain this movie was so interesting i mean it's amazing that this story is no glamorous then something like a comedy it really isn't anything spectacular but the way that these characters are portrayed the way that the directing is done the fact that we have this incredible inner monologue which was then used again by billy wilder in sunset boulevard in 1950 which would also become one of the most iconic stories in filmmaking the fact that he just added these little things to his movie to just really set the mood and really change the tone from something so mundane to something so dark and disturbing is really what drives this film the characters play off of each other beautifully fred mcmurray is fantastic barbara stanwick i have known this woman by name in the world of hollywood and by name only this is the very very first film that i have ever seen starring the great barbara stanwyck and my god i now understand why she really is that iconic name even though i always knew she was iconic edward g robinson i have seen in many many films but i definitely feel that i need to see more films with him especially considering the fact that i recently saw the brian cranston starred film trumbo in which michael stuhlbarg who like one of my other favorite actors in hollywood today bruce greenwood is just one of the most incredible character actors and he played edward g robinson in that film and he was brilliant but to actually see edward g robinson outside of the ten commandments which i've seen many many times i really loved his performance as keys this movie is definitely going to keep you on the edge of your seat it's definitely gonna keep you focused on these characters and i think that you will be pleasantly surprised by this film as a whole unless you are already a billy wilder fan it's not going to surprise you at all but i knew that when i found out that he was the director of this film i knew for a solid fact that i was definitely in for something special does this movie have any negatives well to a certain degree yes it's not necessarily a movie that is going to be loved by everybody because especially with me where noir is very hit or miss like i did not like la confidential but i loved chinatown you know so noir really does bounce back and forth with me but i had a feeling that i was gonna like this one but not everybody does like a noir or drama and it's not a movie that everyone is going to love just because of the nature of the story some people might just find it boring i mean there's not much action and noir is very dialogue driven but it does have some very epic moments that will definitely surprise you but i personally did enjoy this film as a whole it is a movie that i would love to see again i don't know if this is a movie that i'm going to own on dvd just because of the fact that i don't see myself watching it as much as movies like the apartment and some like it hot but to be frank with you guys i'm sort of 50 50 at this point in time and i wouldn't be surprised if i actually found it at a good price somewhere online or in target or something like that i wouldn't be surprised if i actually picked myself up a copy of this film so i will definitely recommend double indemnity it truly is what it lived up to be one of the greatest films of all time definitely one that you should check out if you've never seen it before especially if you're someone that really wants to take a look at some of these truly grand films before things really went into the way that we look at movies today i'm going to be giving double indemnity three and a half stars out of four so thank you very much for watching everybody please leave your comments in the box below and let's discuss double indemnity and
