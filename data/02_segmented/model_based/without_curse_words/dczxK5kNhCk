This is my father's so Wonder Woman
The story of an Amazonian princess travels to the world of men to try to stop a war by destroying the God of War
"We see what shakes her into how she thinks, and watch the equation thing"
"We see her growing through her power, and we see how all of this sheltered life had affect her as soon as she comes to real world, Like she knows nothing"
She's worse than Jon Snow
She knows nothing at all
I think we have to remember that this is her order story
This is how she became one of them's
"a lot of people don't really know about Wonder Woman, so going in this movie noted, they're going to be a lot of build-up for characters"
All the acting in this is superb
Chris Time does an awesome job
Gaza Dog does awesome job
"Danny Husband does an awesome job as the villain David Thewlis, That Dickinson's dudes named David Do this"
He does a great job as well
It's one of the main characters onto the movie itself when they're on the island of the mascara
"Hey, do not shy away from black Amazonian and that made my heart jump"
"Yeah, it's one thing where they show the Greek gods battling and I thought the art direction that one scene like the way they did"
it was really awesome
"India, If y'all have seen any, my reviews character me relating, and we care about the characters is really big for me"
It's like a huge thing for me And the fact that they were able to do that it did that was hardly did that with her mother
"Of course, Diana Creek Spine character, his little ragtag group, like his friends, I liked them all"
I really liked them
All it was
I feel like the director did really well with how she brought them in
how she developed them so quickly and made me care few times I was tearing up
"There are certain things that I probably should have been tearing up on, but I felt like they were my friends"
So the chemistry between Chris Vaughn and Goddard
"Oh, he has the teacher"
everything he has
You know
"she's copy, asking question and she's playing off of him And you know she knows stuff because she's read books, but she hasn't experienced nothing"
"so he is her first experience in France in the world of men, and the way they play off each other in the way today interact is a one"
The only bad thing about this movie was there in the third act
"I want to say, Right before finalizing the third act"
There was this long stretch me about
I'm not long
23 minutes
It just seemed to drag and drag and drag
That's when I started feeling the time of movies with any kind of pickup at that I picked up again
I lost my got lots of moving here
Other than that the pacing was good
I felt like the story moves along very nicely
I think it was good for her first movie
"But one more thing, that kind of bothered me"
Sometimes the soundtrack did not fit the scene
"In my opinion, it was a big deal"
"Most of the one knows that, but just just me, seem like Dc is suffering from a catch up complex, so they try to fit a lot into their movies, and it kind of blows the movies"
"But it was a much more enjoyable two and half hours in Batman Versus Superman, The overall story, The overall feel of the movie, I had fun, Huell, I got my my Wonder Woman teachings, my armbands, my arm shield, I got my Wonder Woman shirt"
"Had a good time, I hope, compared to the first Iron Man, The first Iron Man was great story, great pacing, great origin story, Told you about the character built them up"
"This one does the same thing, Wonder Woman"
You're wondering my book
"So I give it a minus and a Wonder Woman is just playing wonderful, But that is my opinion"
Don't see the movie
I think
"whatever the hell you want to think, parts of Africa, there's no black you"
When you're in
You know different parts of the world or even the universe
There's no black people And I felt like it was a win because there was so many strong black and Mazzoni in' And they didn't like
"They did, shy away from it at all"
Like everything they show Amazon
"they were in there, so that was cool to see"
Don't forget to like
"try or comment down there, series, Friends, Family, I love to Twitter"
Oh
