is the latest movie by Christopher Nolan basically like a retelling of the Meza actually,0.039034307
happened in Dunkirk World War two and it stars Tom Hardy Killian Murphy Mark Rylance,0.18834409
Kenneth Branagh and a lot of different actors and stuff it's moving I'm not like,0.055759683
a huge Chris foreknown fan I do think he's a really good director definitely one,0.045378827
of the best but I don't know if I like personally connect to his movies,0.068093516
like I do a lot of directors like of his generation like Paul Thomas Anderson,0.055110466
David Fincher Sofia Coppola I don't know if I really connect with this movie so,0.10165071
much as those people but I do think he's a really talented director I think,0.075878166
that movies like The Dark Knight and the prestige is definitely classics to me he's,0.030014416
made like a lot of important movies in the past so I do think he's,0.029499564
a really respected director so in that he has his hands on I'm going to,0.016529813
give it a watch because he's that even that talented to me what I didn't,0.03798132
expect was just to be like one my favorite Nolan movies I really wasn't that,0.05455038
high for this but I was just only surprised I think this is really good,0.031697333
what I do like about this is like the actual atmosphere of the movie it,0.03386982
really puts you in these soldiers shoes and stuff like that feels really authentic to,0.021570574
the time like the costumes the weapons that they use though vehicle that they use,0.039932303
even including like the planes of stuff like that it all feels like like you're,0.04981893
in that time period like I feel like a cuties in that way that it,0.043705225
honestly looks like it was actually made in the 40s or 50s like it doesn't,0.03127893
feel like a modern movie and that's kind of in a good way the sound,0.037606157
design is really immersive like it really puts you in the soldier shoes and stuff,0.043810327
like that and it really makes you feel what they're feeling like I was like,0.021048406
really tense the entire time I was watching the movie and that's a really good,0.04436376
job with the sound design I guess what movie it just really puts you in,0.019113386
their shoes I really like those 10 scenes that really focus on like the soldiers,0.040078644
trying to navigate how to get out of the situation after in like the beginning,0.025608905
works just like super wordless and there's no talking but it's like in this like,0.02870334
house I can away from my peoples might be out himself like that it feels,0.069894835
really like heightened and it really puts you in that solder shoes without really like,0.03561593
telling you what is happening so like that you just really figure out as he's,0.054002933
going along and stuff and it really puts you in his shoes the other thing,0.032371163
I like what's going to be a lot like it didn't really like explain who,0.04109837
these people were and what they were doing before they had the war and stuff,0.20861955
like that like with a lot of war movies they really try to do that,0.06136053
like character description and stuff like that I really feel like they're truly trying to,0.015019847
make you relate to them what you always say oh I had a wife or,0.020877454
whatever like that before I came out here and just like we know this stuff,0.07055337
I don't need to rehash the type of things that I feel like an actual,0.03461682
war situation like that you really want to be talking about that type of stuff,0.11958871
but you would just be trying to get the help out of there and that's,0.022375448
really what this movie try to convey it's like it really makes you feel like,0.029930603
this is how you would actually act a war like running away trying to save,0.05898516
people so that not really thinking about yourself in the situation like it's just you,0.11272934
just really are just trying to get out of this situation so like that and,0.019801851
that moves we really conveys that with a different on ways of the child approach,0.039126102
that with the land like the soldier that was trying to get away by the,0.02714947
sea lettuce innocence or trying to save people and buy hair wear the soldier is,0.020632
trying to shoot down targets of like the kind of help to people on his,0.28170192
side and stuff like that you really do get a sense of what these people,0.07223429
are trying to do without the movie sitting down and explaining that to us and,0.025926864
I do appreciate no one for doing that aspect of the movie I do think,0.052386537
the theme a movie is basically like survival of what you will do in the,0.043979947
situations like that the movie does that without really telling you that the theme of,0.02019564
the movie is else is what I got for the movie and it really kind,0.034192435
of shows you that with the two soldiers on the land Tommy so like beyond,0.020806279
Whitehead is kind of like the good-good nature side of severe evil war he's trying,0.1292831
to do the right thing and trying to help people in a situation as much,0.032299988
as he can and then it's kind of on the flip side with Alex so,0.025186514
by Harry Styles who is really just trying to look out for himself and just,0.019135337
try to get out the situation as best as he can I thought that the,0.030223949
two actors really did a good job trying to convey their different modes of that,0.040020775
and it really felt really authentic and I was real surprised by their acting and,0.022762584
I really really surprised by Harry Styles I was like why is Christopher Nolan getting,0.025979413
Harry Styles to be in a serious movie but he does a really good job,0.03645805
it was a little bit distracting but first because you're just like that's Harry Styles,0.067996405
in a war movie this is weird but it is a really good job with,0.07063652
his character I think the veteran actors like Tom Hardy Kenneth Branagh killing and Murphy,0.2624693
and Mark violence they do a lot of stuff with their roles even though they're,0.1283412
not in the movie a lot those actors really did a lot with a minimal,0.05036305
light dialogue they had I really think that Harry Styles actually had the most dialogue,0.029983154
this movie which is really good to say you know Christopher Nolan movie but the,0.06617912
actors all did a really good job with the worlds that they were given we,0.02490248
would look like a lot of dialogue to any of them what if this is,0.039509915
like a perfect movie these aren't like major problems amoeba trees with some things that,0.19792274
I had like I thought that the sea part of the movie which is kind,0.03274167
of focused on more islands character wasn't as gripping as a other part you can,0.02572997
feel as urgent as like the land stuff or the air stuff it isn't really,0.010642938
pushing in there as much as those parts of movies did and I think that,0.035655174
kind of slowed down the pacing on the movie have time to look at that,0.027926406
but I guess I was the problem the movie and I do get the importance,0.041023873
of it but it just kind of slowed down my enjoyment I guess it's kind,0.09037784
of thrown out of pace I also think that the way that he approached a,0.06603012
story that kind of focusing on these three separate narrative the land the sea and,0.021537982
the air was interesting and it really kind of real off-guard like you would be,0.08178965
in these situations but I just felt like at times it felt kind of gimmicky,0.027518647
to me and it felt like I don't know like it kind of was just,0.036480665
a little bit too sentimental especially was like the sea part of the movie but,0.06445962
overall I think this is a really great movie I don't know what the replay,0.051271692
value of this is going to be like I don't know I would probably watch,0.061546117
this again I'm outside is like a maybe in theatre so I don't think I,0.071963556
probably watched like a whole or whatever like that am i doing this is a,0.050811384
really great movie with donating like technical aspects like this movie looks gorgeous especially during,0.033863835
the air parts of movies I do think that acting is really good and the,0.021195412
theme is really clear-cut without it being too preachy anything like that but I do,0.08737121
think that the pacing is kind of off in some parts and I do think,0.07813713
that the narrative is kind of gimmicky at points overall I'll give us an 8,0.016545113
out of 10 I definitely think this is probably one of no-one's best movies but,0.029305331
I'll probably have to go over my ranking but I think this is probably my,0.01667948
top three no our movies so yeah those are my thoughts on Dunkirk what do,0.05457832
you guys thought did you like it did you hate it let me know comments,0.0976024
