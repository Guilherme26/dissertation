hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse,0.07370928
we talk about music movies art and culture and today in another unscripted movie review we're gonna be talk about the newest film from Pixar Coco,0.08501069
so I'm a big Pixar fans surprising nobody I think anybody who goes into Pixar especially these days they've got such a market and storied catalogue of phenomenal movies and triumphs of animation that I'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who is not a pretty diehard Pixar fan yeah the cars movies they're not great,0.16426085
they're primarily there to sell merchandise and there have been some duds I can admit that,0.23655124
but when you take a look at things like the Toy Story trilogy ratatouille wall-e inside out especially oh my god that movie gets me this day there's a lot of depth and thematic exploration and a stunning amount of nuance that you don't typically see in other Animation particularly in stuff that's more marketed towards kids,0.10854618
and I can appreciate that I definitely respect that Pixar is willing to take some chances going through some pretty dark material,0.06788562
there's a surprising number of Pixar films that explore death with a lot of frankness that I definitely respect,0.15339531
and thus it doesn't surprise me to a certain extent that Coco got released which takes a lot of the celebration around es de los Muertos,0.26662454
and then builds a fascinating way to connect the real life to the afterlife and what might come after while entrenched in Mexican culture,0.14951928
now let me stress is rather the gate this movie is genuinely great,0.0641768
I'm a big fan of it I want you guys to all see this now,0.0901099
and it's also one of those movies I really don't want to spoil because there's some movies where you can say that the twist comes in and you spoil it it doesn't really,0.073174186
bother you all that much because it's more of a twist that is more intellectually satisfying,0.27372378
and to discuss the twist brings a lot into whereas,0.046056423
this one the twist you can go man if you've seen a lot of family movies if you've seen a lot of Pixar movies you could probably Telegraph it,0.11194126
I certainly was able to,0.064251974
but when it comes to the emotional nuance underpinning a lot of that I don't want to spoil that because again this is a genuinely great movie and I really recommend you guys go out and see it,0.10013409
it's already breaking box-office records in certain spots,0.07050447
you know what for a movie in this,0.087810725
I think it deserves to cuz,0.2405063
yeah it is that good,0.058883727
so let me give you a little bit of an outline of the story the main character Miguel,0.10437122
he's a young kid growing up in a family of shoemakers like his great great grandfather he wants to be a musician,0.33053738
he wants to play guitar he wants to be part in that Mexican culture and maybe mariachi it's hard to tell but at the same time he also realizes that his grandmother is very much against that because his great-great-grandfather reportedly abandoned them would you often seek his fortune become a musician,0.15107477
so when he eventually has a clash with his family he runs off finds an instrument a very special instrument from a man that he thinks is his grandfather because that man was the greatest musician in all of Mexico at that time and then things get a little strange because he discovers there's a way through that time a deal dos,0.08108639
Marcos travel back to the land of the dead,0.24243236
now let me stress this right out of the gate,0.1056885
the animation is gorgeous,0.113959685
it's more stylized sure and there are ways that some people could argue that it ties into it might feel culturally insensitive,0.08845249
it was handled by the wrong people but I don't see that whatsoever primarily because it feels like this movie was made with somebody with the frankness to frame,0.10336931
everything as a very Mexican story told and written mostly by Mexicans,0.26930717
there's lots of elements of unsettled Spanish which I really appreciate in terms of in jokes,0.114388056
it's a pretty overall funny movie but there's a lot of that that makes you think that it is primarily marketed for a Latin audience honestly I'm okay with that the fact that you can still get the gist,0.061927393
the fact that the emotional three line is as strong as it is,0.040602174
Thank You,0.029942775
Pixar is a great credit to this story but the thing is as much as I like that and as much as the music plays such a element in here it ties into two themes that I do want to discuss briefly as much as I can without spoilers because the primary theme really is surrounding family,0.05227917
and what role you are given as a part of your family,0.104929395
and how you might want to buck against it,0.128678
I really do appreciate the level of nuance that's brought to the table here because everyone is looking out for their best interest within the family unit,0.06555568
there is an element that these people genuinely do love each other,0.06336616
so when the grandmother wants to for bid Miguel from pursuing music,0.09893009
it comes from a place of deep-seated hurt and pain that she wants to try to bomb over because of how her mother got left behind,0.552694
there's a lot of emotional pace that runs through that storyline and the family does become the root of so much of this question especially when placed opposite the other theme which is exploring what it is to become an artist,0.062249567
and what you have to give and give up in order to do,0.08134232
so because yeah there was a musician who left his family in this story and the consequences of what that is and what art he created and where that art becomes properly attributed if at all in order to discuss legacy going forward,0.05089413
in other words where that art,0.066709556
how it might be remembered or whether the artists won't wind up getting forgotten that becomes a very potent through line through the story and that whole underlying theme of memory how people think of somebody either alive or very much dead and whether that memory could be potentially misconstrued or potentially there are gaps in it or what it truly means to be forgotten especially in that arc of a family that's potent as hell and honestly as someone who does have very close ties to my intimate family that did hit pretty hard especially when it comes to the ending cuz,0.10520202
yeah this is one of those movies where especially if you have that tight-knit family experience or you want to have that tight-knit family experience that it's a bit of a tearjerker and you know what that transcends cultural boundaries I completely admit that especially with the undercurrents of bucking against fam maybe to pursue a passion,0.13469978
now I can't say I completely love this movie but it's not one of my favorite movies of the year I do think it's sofa matically resonant,0.1337338
I think its target audience will absolutely adore it,0.08684214
and I'd give it all the credit in the world for that at the same time,0.07417308
a lot of it is bounded in Latin and mariachi music and a lot of that aesthetic and personally just for me that's not an aesthetic,0.064020045
I entirely love I will admit that it's just a personal play,0.09676684
it doesn't do a lot for me,0.08398598
but at the same time for the audience for which it will resonate and I like how much it is subtly updated and modernized it doesn't feel anachronistic at all,0.05818527
I do appreciate that definitely it feels like a lived-in grown experience,0.08318872
and when the music is on its point at its most authentic and organic it does sound beautiful,0.07040274
and the whole discussion of again tying into artistic attribution taking what could be a simple song and magnifying it and blowing,0.17369844
it up beyond,0.06646462
its necessary proportions,0.090177745
I do love the tragic ironies and consequences that come with that it is truly remarkable when it sees that element of the artistic process and how it could be misconstrued,0.07376182
but also there one moment that I will say is that it deals a lot with memory,0.05045599
if you have anybody who is older in your life who is struggling with memory who is struggling with that know losing their memory or potentially facing Alzheimer's,0.23966181
yeah the ending is gonna get you,0.26582593
well actually most of this movie will get to you,0.09757074
I love that Pixar doesn't balk away from that sadness,0.105713025
I don't think they pull their punches,0.31089434
here,0.053441156
I don't think the punch quite hits as hard as it does for Toy Story 3 or wall-e or there's a couple movies that will have harder inside out personally for me especially ratatouille,0.17390311
if you understand the ending coming as a critic that you get why that one cuts but at the same time for Coco there are elements I'm not sure it hits entirely as deeply because again when you're dealing with the real life and the afterlife,0.08843717
the fact that they are able to give stakes to the afterlife part of the movie is impressive,0.06266609
but at the same time it does slightly undercut the possibilities especially when memory becomes so much of the key of this story but at the same time for a kids movie for a movie in this vein that can still be very much enjoyed,0.09335034
and appreciated by adults especially given the audience that it's pitched to I can see this being really powerful and really resonating for me,0.08031913
I might not love it the same way,0.14994605
but again I can appreciate the audience that will it's a light a tight n definitely recommended go see this film I think a lot of the voice acting is terrific,0.11451681
the jokes are on point especially the ones that are tied into music and the artistic process that really got to me,0.079242654
and yeah it is a bit of a tearjerker,0.44806033
I can omit that it's it's a Pixar movie you get what you come for but beyond that I definitely recommend you check out cocoa and by the way that title it might be a little bit surprising,0.15655476
when you figure out why it's called that until you realize that cocoa is the emotional locus of really the entire film and that's powerful in and of its own right,0.03607567
you'll understand when you see it,0.094426244
I don't want to give anything away,0.104729705
but yeah thanks a lot for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd be more than grateful,0.04974692
