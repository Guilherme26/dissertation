the shape of water was directed by Guillermo del Toro and star Sally Hawkins Michael,0.068048134
Shannon Octavia Spencer and Doug Jones and is the story of a mute woman who,0.28561977
works at a science facility in the 1960s who encounters an aquatic creature it's been,0.091806
captured it's being experimented on and something about this just doesn't sit right with her,0.09026198
she's also a woman who feels a little incomplete not just because she's not able,0.37004408
to speak but because she feels unfulfilled in her life as a result of that,0.18120272
her neighbor played by Richard Jenkins is an artist who also feels very unfulfilled and,0.04250584
can't seem to find his place in life and Hawkins and Spencer both play janitors,0.19199562
who clean this research facility so this gives them access to certain areas that they,0.069845624
normally wouldn't have access to that other government officials can only go in as a,0.07512246
result Hawkins starts to develop a relationship with this creature and we have a movie,0.17402655
now del Toro's last few films have disappointed me I wasn't a humongous fan of,0.13505343
Pacific Rim it was alright as an anime fan I should have loved that movie,0.101005524
and crimson peak I didn't really like it all and so going into the shape,0.06038366
of water I was excited based off of his knack for incredible visuals alone but,0.07892402
when I left I was impressed not just with the visuals but with the astounding,0.058160815
performances and that theme of being incomplete being unfulfilled because so many characters in this,0.067030005
movie feel that way even Michael Shannon as the evil villain the government official who,0.33350033
is torturing this creature and trying to learn from it even he doesn't feel like,0.37195763
he's reached his levels of greatness yet everyone in this film has something about them,0.11710713
that feels incomplete something that they haven't been able to attain or something they desire,0.106937334
and they need a void filled and for Sally Hawkins character this creature fills that,0.3169322
void because the creature doesn't understand the fact that she's mute they learned to communicate,0.39385313
through sign language and so he doesn't look at her as an incomplete person anymore,0.24149586
and this is one of the few people or things that she's ever encountered that,0.102418266
looks at her that way and so immediately she's taken aback by that so yes,0.101984136
it is a story about a woman and a weird fish monster and it's kind,0.45394304
of a love story which could be a little creepy for some people and kind,0.15346761
of a turn-off but it's not just about that it's about being unfulfilled in life,0.12093314
and how we can fill these voids in the people or things that we meet,0.2531135
it's brilliantly acted Sally Hawkins is terrific here and I think she deserves an Oscar,0.24013934
nomination honestly Richard Jenkins is also quite good as his Octavia Spencer Michael Shannon Michael,0.075043
Stalberg everyone in this movie is giving top-notch work but let's talk about the visuals,0.07859505
because they leap off the screen this is a visual masterwork it's beautifully directed the,0.048494074
cinematography is a lush the colours explode off of the screen it's one of the,0.13387479
best looking films of the year by far and if it doesn't get nominated for,0.057292562
Best Cinematography I would be surprised this is a gorgeous gorgeous movie and del Toro,0.107047796
once again has proven that he has such a knack for beautiful production design and,0.09589054
choosing people to work in this set to make it look as best as it,0.11269524
can because so much of this movie is gratefully in-camera Doug Jones as this creature,0.2741906
the suit that he wears and all of that makeup and prosthetic work is beautiful,0.1442795
as for issues with the movie I would say towards the third act it gets,0.089382075
a little bit cheesy and a little predictable I could see where it was going,0.22232461
and it seemed like it ended at some point but then it continued to go,0.048115507
on some of the pacing is a little bit affected by a sort of strange,0.1503769
event that occurs and a side story that doesn't always live up to what the,0.021860655
rest of the film is doing and I could have used a little more time,0.045388896
at the facility building this relationship between Sally Hawkins and the creature because once certain,0.107973196
things happen it does feel a little rushed but besides that I think this is,0.07674034
a beautiful movie with one of Sally Hawkins best performances a great side plot with,0.08395864
Richard Jenkins that I did not expect that really says a lot about not just,0.08755126
the 1960s but unfortunately today as well and it's really powerful Octavia Spencer really good,0.07911648
Michael Shannon everybody in the film shines and instead of just falling back on Creature,0.07417181
from the Black Lagoon cliches it has a startling message about how we fill the,0.22419459
voids in our life and being unfulfilled as people and I thought it was really,0.15509087
