how's it going everybody this is brian for pop culture crossing and today we are,0.064081594
talking about the Philadelphia Story so this movie was released in 1940 and surrounds the,0.07480779
story of Traci Lords wedding now Traci is a rich socialite from a very historic,0.096771196
rich family in Philadelphia the film features memorable characters great dialogue a complex dramatic though,0.013793955
humorous story and great cinematography all the elements that I think you know result in,0.062281787
a great movie I think you'll enjoy it and you'll probably want to share it,0.08867942
with your friends so the story of this movie is based on Phillip Barry's play,0.07757116
and this portrays the final hours leading up to the to the wedding of Tracy,0.09365359
Lord she's getting married to a man named George Kittredge and he unlike Tracy was,0.15025201
not born into wealth rather he grew into well through his professional progression now the,0.086298354
plans for the wedding however are complicated when Sidney Kidd the publisher of a tabloid,0.20342948
magazine called spy sends reporter and a photojournalist Holly Connor portrayed by Jimmy Stewart and,0.080858015
Elizabeth Embry portrayed by Ruth Hussey to infiltrate the Lord wedding which was being held,0.11403734
on the Lord estate and to provide a juicy story for the magazine so because,0.054931283
the Lord's are pretty strict and do not like the press especially the tabloids you,0.29857007
know it's not easy to get in but the way that they get in is,0.053643163
through Tracy's ex-husband CK Dexter Haven who has also worked for Spy magazine and their,0.09948388
bonus ares bureau and he plans to introduce Macaulay and Elizabeth to the Lord's as,0.10391591
friends of Tracy's brother who works in Argentina and you know knows Dexter as expected,0.0928162
yeah all of the workings and elements here for a very dramatic and humorous story,0.07819343
to unfold so Dexter's unannounced arrival at the Lord residence you know naturally irritates and,0.078044385
distracts Tracy from focusing on the last hours in the last day before her wedding,0.07442735
luckily for the lords Tracy her younger sister Diana and Tracy's mother Margaret are very,0.11334021
sharp and astute and figure out pretty quickly what's going on here and that McCauley,0.18917492
and Elizabeth are not actually friends of her brother genius but are actually tabloid reporters,0.1511888
so once the Tracy figures this out she tells Dexter Dexter actually confesses and explains,0.0710961
that he's being exploited by Sydney kid the Spy magazine publisher as part of a,0.31089434
big blackmail operation that if spy doesn't write a juicy story about Tracy's wedding Kidd,0.23463744
will publish a like takedown piece on Tracy's philandering father sets Lord so all this,0.2412629
complexity is developing very early on in the movie the film's pace in general is,0.029763209
very brisk develops really rapidly and this is largely due to the intricacies of the,0.05367563
story and the film itself so because of these factors I definitely recommend if you're,0.031870447
watching this for the first time that you watch it with no distractions because you,0.12413649
know you want to pick up on all the story beats it's very easy to,0.071806364
miss something and if you miss something you know it could you know really alter,0.06076704
your perspective of the film as a whole so you really want to be of,0.09196792
a sharp mindset when you're watching this now that's not to say that this movie,0.1066973
isn't fun because it is a very entertaining maybe to watch you just want to,0.10149587
be able to follow the whole story progression and you know keep track of all,0.028339403
the details at play here as the story develops Tracy learns that Macaulay is a,0.038279057
writer and you know he actually finds his book and really admires the poetry and,0.065701775
the proverbs of his writing and this sparks a flirtatious relationship between the two and,0.062935084
you know this coupled with the fact that Dexter just shows up and it's you,0.10714026
know kind of obvious that he may still like her creates a full-fledged love triangle,0.24155244
so you have Tracy in the middle and then you have George Kittredge CK Dexter,0.31387648
Haven and Macaulay Connor so Tracy's new emotional state kind of when she starts flirting,0.1379508
with Macaulay is really compounded by the fact that her wedding is the next day,0.07440749
so not great timing not you know just not a good situation so that really,0.09478031
compounds and dramatis Isis the story now the Philadelphia Story is narrative though it is,0.1354245
complex is quite engaging as I mentioned briefly and the tone is fairly dramatic as,0.09299215
a whole I would say though there are very fun light comedic elements peppered throughout,0.053037174
so it's not just dry terse drama it is very light and entertaining so throughout,0.075988114
the multi-faceted nature of the story and Tracy's love triangle there are several very important,0.09905079
lessons that are clearly communicated and there's particularly see a sequence of several scenes in,0.046223722
the second act where these important messages are really vocalized so I want to share,0.05560568
these with you just briefly they provide some of this important messaging in the movie,0.124539874
I don't consider them to be spoilers pretty much everything that happens following these conversations,0.111279845
as spoilers and you know I'm not gonna talk about that because you should watch,0.15734187
it but anyways so there three conversations conversation tracy has with Dexter a conversation tracy,0.11634206
has with George Kittredge and a conversation tracy has with her father Seth so the,0.1114523
first stop you know Tracy you know was raised in this wealthy family she's quite,0.1170579
spoiled and frankly acts like a goddess so Dexter notes that because of this she's,0.47127122
always had people get her out of her problems she's never had to fix her,0.23082459
own problems or anything that she has caused she always has her family come rescue,0.17654644
her so because of this Dexter charges Tracy with being a classic narcissist who you,0.6596854
know in addition to be a narc to being a narcissist is very judgmental of,0.49360943
others and other the mistakes of others and she herself has her own struggles but,0.09558278
she maintains this veneer of protection and you know she acts like she's protected from,0.1541668
everyone else and because of this she acts perfect and she thinks she's perfect and,0.1476728
acts like this goddess now more importantly Dexter goes even further and says that Tracy,0.1535064
will never be a first-class woman until she learns to accept human frailty and weakness,0.2666348
now these are you know pretty pretty scathing critiques of Tracy's life here because Tracy,0.3020574
just had this conversation with Dexter I kind of opened her eyes to how others,0.24219649
perceive err and because of this she now views Kittredge a little bit differently and,0.109217644
through kittredges conversation with her it becomes very evident that he does view her as,0.11762662
a goddess and it's like perfect statue that he puts up on a pedestal and,0.1812736
he has no intention of you know bringing down so this all slightly alters and,0.22043723
kind of jars Tracy's perception of Kittredge and you know it becomes very clear that,0.06641814
Kittredge well Tracy actually is very concerned that Kittridge may have actually fallen in love,0.06984624
with her aura instead of Tracy the human now shortly after this talk you know,0.13702245
these conversations are so sequential like boom boom boom and it's like holy cow talk,0.16429669
about overwhelming insane conversation so this final talk between her father Seth and Tracy happens,0.4492491
leading up right into this final party the night before the wedding and Seth just,0.05702713
curtly and bluntly explains that Tracy possesses everything that she needs to be a lovely,0.08759994
woman except an understanding heart and you know Seth's observation as well as Dexter's observation,0.24445346
complement each other and that she's not understanding she's you know doesn't accept human weakness,0.3489205
she kind of and because of that she thinks of herself as you know above,0.23502825
everyone else and these observations from Seth and Dexter are clearly juxtaposed by kittredges just,0.06228627
obsession with her being a goddess and him just like worshiping her however Tracy doesn't,0.24228083
want to be venerated and worshipped she just wants to be loved like a human,0.23585731
like everyone else keep in mind there's this love triangle going on and then everything,0.15746549
else happens and the third act is full and replete with drama and humor so,0.13691542
I'm not gonna spoil how the movie pans out here I'm just gonna set this,0.35389978
up note some of these important lessons here and hope that you watch the movie,0.071141236
and experience it for yourself because I think you're really missing out if you don't,0.1341238
now the performance performance is of the entire cast is just terrific across the board,0.06291916
so in terms of the principles Cary Grant CK Dexter Haven is very well done,0.10028813
he's a very calm and collected character though he's sensitive and he communicates that very,0.13001186
well you get a good sense of Dexter's past and his previous marriage to Tracy,0.070613235
and Grant is great in communicating the emotions felt by dexstar you know very convincingly,0.05030511
Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord is very skillfully acted now Tracy's developmental character art is great,0.09601151
and impressive and notable and this speaks to both the writing as well as Hepburn's,0.057208
ability to accurately portray this James Stewart and Ruth Hussey hussies portrayal of Macaulay Connor,0.042269927
and Elizabeth imbrie or in breed rather are very well acted as well and a,0.10249376
sharp wit of these two characters especially and just the expert way in which they,0.08046085
deliver them there is a very memorable they have a lot of great one-liners it's,0.05983185
just you know beside observations that some of the audience may be thinking but they,0.021184934
kind of say it now John Howard's George Kittredge is also very compelling performance Howard,0.08963149
does a great job of showing the Kittredge was not born into the wealth like,0.079406016
Dexter or Tracy rather he grew into it he was a coal miner and then,0.122622825
he rose through the ranks became a manager of a coal company and because of,0.07099399
this he is still kind of on the outside so he there's a lot of,0.0951909
like the upper privileged class that he doesn't really understand and that he's learning that,0.088946156
through Tracy and the Lord's and I think that this element helps make Kittredge a,0.06727859
more realistic character if it weren't for Kittredge Macaulay or Elizabeth you know the movie,0.07212079
would just be full of these super opulent rich people and the majority of the,0.40649927
audiences don't have points of references or touchstones for that so these those three characters,0.10987103
and you know Dinah's character the younger sister especially make it more you know more,0.06326552
realistic and connects more with the audience themselves lastly virginia wheelers Dinah Lord is you,0.0916536
know Tracy's younger sister is the most enjoyable character in the movie I think just,0.09241979
dinah likes dexter she doesn't like Kittredge and she's not you know happy about this,0.24171314
whole marriage thing at all and though she is young she's very perceptive very self-aware,0.15352954
and she actually connects a lot of the dots of you know what's happening between,0.123767704
the characters before the adult characters themselves are able to see and realize what's going,0.04997228
on and you know this keen awareness coupled with her dramatic antics just adds to,0.39672574
the characters charm and you know this type of the character actually really reminds me,0.049997557
of Maura Wilson's Susan Walker in Miracle on 34th Street and that they are very,0.053996168
young but they're wise well beyond their years and you know their observations and opinions,0.0588373
go toe to toe with the adult characters and wheeler does a great depiction of,0.12186613
this and a spot-on in her performance so the Philadelphia story's production design and cinematography,0.05143949
are all so well done and you know they are worth noting frankly the set,0.075358756
pieces particularly the pieces around the lordís state and residents are very well done and,0.087526955
well realized and these set pieces complemented with the cinematography and the tight tight nature,0.16437796
of the shots and just how the shots themselves are composed really make it immersive,0.22796272
and make the audience feel like you are actually a fly on the wall on,0.13092163
you know in the Lord residence watching this entire thing unfold it's actually really impressive,0.07760457
how it's the production design and the cinematography are executed now George Cukor's direction of,0.12447825
the Philadelphia Story is frankly nothing but masterful he is able to seamlessly translate this,0.09843126
complex story and originally play into cohesive type film and the final product is just,0.026255742
clear evidence of Cougars ability to expertly manage the production the cinematography the music and,0.06832964
expert ability to bring about very very great convincing performances from his entire cast and,0.093099706
as such tell a quite touching story so I've seen the Philadelphia Story numerous times,0.057207305
and each time I see it it seems like I pick up on something new,0.13332015
and this is a testament of robust storytelling and directing now this movie I highly,0.051989444
recommend it I think it's a great go to movie if you're looking you know,0.10728899
