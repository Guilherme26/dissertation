hey what's gonna have the YouTube,0.14786167
this is SEL zero t20 zjv,0.14376266
I swam back here again for another review I told you I was making a slew of reviews throughout this week because I am trying to get down and narrow down to my top 10 list I just finished watching moonlight,0.085736826
this is a movie by Barry Jenkins,0.11283393
I don't know if the beer drink is actually wrote it and directed I believe he did do the screenplay,0.079577394
but this was a masterfully directed film I do know that Naomi Harris who plays chyrons mother when it's named Paula she's the mother of this and then Marsala Ally both of them got nominated for Golden Globe nominations,0.12242694
I was very curious to see you know the depths of their their very much,0.10698346
so well acclaimed,0.08686626
I guess roles in this but the ones this handed out for me was you know all the different actors that play,0.13438554
chyron trivanti did an amazing job as the older version of Iran and in his element and kind of gone through the circumstances of everything and as well as Andre Holland which Kevin and Sharon have an interest in history,0.088748045
the reason why Tron goes by the alias of black is because he called him that then I believe what was the other guy's name I think it was a Sean Ashton Sanders who plays the middle version of chyron did amazing long story short they all did an amazing job with their performance as this man cared,0.242321
because the character unlike normal,0.105943665
conventional films is very conflicted,0.09701856
I mean he's dealing with poverty,0.17431922
he's dealing with the mother,0.11243837
there's got a substance abuse issues,0.15430932
it comes in to addiction that becomes into just a life altering situation where he doesn't know when he's gonna live or stay,0.09744516
and his mother is just so unstable,0.7374541
that is heart-wrenching to actually really watch because that happens all the time I mean like depending on where you grew up,0.05646503
you know I'm saying like you would see something like this,0.1554886
and this is the thing about the film and what I have to give credits do for,0.052259386
Barry Jenkins,0.057261854
this does not feel like a film,0.14989053
this like talking about like a random,0.14113683
book story,0.034112774
this seems like they went straight up,0.1622826
you know I'm saying to a specific location,0.09493155
and just film the life of a person,0.17371763
this is what I mean a lot of people love boyhood I love boyhood,0.15428329
but this takes boyhood and goes here you can't see my hand because this like the actors commit to the environment,0.20665546
I think it's a place in the 1980s if I'm not mistaken but they commit to it like it's so believable the dialogue the personas the environment,0.085158184
it's like I mean like I don't even know how the actors were able to commit that well,0.24206248
and that's the thing even the cinematography it adds more immersion in a lot of different ways where like you might have like you know chyron has a young adult,0.14808592
he's just getting chased down the block,0.22695576
and you don't know where he's gonna go and just feel scary you know,0.2769728
and then when he is an adult and you know you know I'm saying like he's a big dude,0.3097565
now like who's gonna really get some you know,0.07510522
but he's got all its insecurities in himself,0.15419702
he's tormented in his mind,0.3847651
and the biggest thing about this movie this the underlying theme that I haven't brought brought up at all is the fact that this is very much,0.074464
so dealing with homosexuality and homophobia homosexuality,0.62950456
in the sense that Iran is a character that that is something that he's from know,0.09822447
what age was maybe 8 or 9 like his mother was really teetering him with the prospect of that,0.1910424
and then this one random guy who plays volley of one decides to be his surrogate father in the midst of his adolescence of understanding who he is,0.12019308
and that's where Ali does an amazing job like he is an amazing surrogate father he's not the father,0.13306104
but he's an amazing surrogate father and her as a mom she's just a total opposite,0.44666332
I was this like but there are the thing about it there's certain things that happen with those two characters that I didn't expect towards the middle of John's life everything shifts where things just get completely worse,0.09422114
that's how it is well high school no matter what it's like,0.12674266
that's where the the moments will break you or forge you through the fire essential,0.11969446
and he went unfortunately through both where's his mother she just was gone and then on top of that wand was gone and it was like dang,0.3508387
what is he gonna become you know,0.073608495
and his is interesting back and forth with this character,0.05733797
Kevin especially in the middle part,0.045405235
it was like something terrible happened and it put him on his platform whereas like he's just a pitfall,0.24096248
essentially you know,0.055377595
and he becomes honestly what one was even though Wang was a good father and stuff like that,0.093762934
so I could father he was a drug dealer and there's consequences with that lifestyle that you lead and this film does not end,0.23982875
you know,0.07163658
and the happiest of the lucky ways but going back to the aspect of homosexuality in sense with chyron,0.49326718
he not that he hated himself but he did not know how to you know make it through this situation cuz,0.16282247
he didn't have mom,0.13388872
so he doesn't have anybody,0.16312723
it was like from jump like people were just ready to attack him,0.7649206
you know,0.07163658
and you know,0.056913003
I think Wan knew that his mother knew that they didn't know how he was gonna make it,0.31089434
you know but he did he had to go through these circumstances that platform them into this next this next level as a man and it's very it's very deep,0.1711116
it's a rough film it's a rough though I mean I think that for people that deal with worrying or a little slight homophobia,0.52705055
there are some very explicit scenes,0.060584106
there's some scenes there was a slight,0.05384641
you know but the thing about it,0.06366668
they don't this is the thing,0.094974115
this is the this is the quintessential thing to I respect about this film is that,0.09390794
there are there's a lot underlying theme of you know the the understanding of his own homosexuality,0.583578
his sexuality as understanding as being a man very much so and where they could have taken a lot of gory scenes or not grotesque or sensual scenes of having like sex all over the place and everything with different people you know,0.58409435
and they didn't do that they use tact they use very well placed in a Matar fee to not even show necessarily any nudity but it was very much,0.13546789
so things that are implied and that's where I said there's a warning there,0.08109096
but I respect the director and the way that they crafted this film there is no nudity like the scenes that show the sensual connection or chemistry between like Kevin or chyron or other people are all done through scenes through acting,0.07679042
there's just one specific scene which I run and Kevin when they're adults in the diner or even when they're in a car and you could tell there were some definite little emotional triggers that were happening,0.09975252
whereas they could have kind of just like made it really uncomfortable and cringe-worthy they just decided to commit to it from dialogue and through eye contact and through nuances of confusion,0.1521391
it's like you get to see ty run out of his element in in his element and knowing himself as an adult and not knowing what he's gonna become,0.29789984
and there's very interesting ride,0.084024474
very well executed film ten out of ten,0.31089434
yeah,0.040847696
it's not a film you can sit there and watch over and over again though because it's very heavy,0.15485567
but definitely one of the better films I've seen this year,0.059487473
so the last film I got to check out be probably man chest about to see or hex or ridge,0.1523063
I don't know if I can stomach hex or Ridge tonight and Manchester by sea I've heard it's very depressing,0.17788604
so I might just kind of cut in for tonight,0.22134417
but hopefully y'all did enjoy my review for moonlight,0.109168485
keep it alive JV,0.15368485
I swear you'll stop I'll talk to y'all later have a blessed night,0.19482638
peace,0.05524092
