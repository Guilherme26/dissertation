hello and welcome to episode 235 of the epic film challenge to a thousand one,0.10206523
movies you must see before you die from 1950 All About Eve I really wished,0.46764705
I'd made this review in fact I think they did film a version of this,0.1161744
many many weeks ago I've sold this film for the first time six weeks ago,0.060495194
and the heatwave hit it was just impossible to film a video I tried and,0.0814883
it was just a terrible video and there have been so many reviews and videos,0.27833018
in this series where I thought you know I'm really happy and proud of that,0.035524566
review what I said about the film I articulated myself on why I liked it,0.10742762
why I didn't like it had never been plenty of videos where I feel like,0.09703458
I've done a really bad job and this is a film I feel like I,0.12370736
need to do at least a decent job well because it's it's worth it it's,0.1316878
one of those films that's really special and I need to try and convey that,0.09457197
in the best way I possibly can so hopefully I can still do that even,0.060049742
though it's many many weeks since I've saw it but I will say that you,0.070266336
know what six weeks ago since then I've probably seen twenty thirty films maybe more,0.08317637
than that and it's more fresh in my mind than most of the films I've,0.096778594
seen since then it has that impact it has that staying power I've never seen,0.057285603
it before had heard about it one of those classic titles all about Eve Bette,0.071726054
Davis and I was assuming that Eve was going to be a character played by,0.027975963
Bette Davis but it's not and this film was hugely successful when it came out,0.08947847
in 1951 the Academy Award for Best Picture Best Director best script Best Supporting Actor,0.022205561
for George Sanders it's it really just swept the board and was nominated and one,0.084483154
other kind of awards as well and it's interesting to me that this film came,0.067985445
out in 1950 the same year as a little movie called Sunset Boulevard which they,0.07492814
can draw a lot of parallels between those two movies they're both about an aging,0.091768615
actress and you know that there's similar themes they're very different films but there's a,0.09486466
there's a thread of similarity that that kind of joins them together at least of,0.1893741
all the fact that they came out in the same year anyway Bette Davis stars,0.06231827
as Margo Channing a theatre actress a very famous stage actress who's in her forties,0.13397281
now and she's kind of feeling it you know she's one of those women who,0.30464932
are kind of her presence fills up the entire room she's a very boisterous very,0.27674258
kind of a strong strong-willed a strong personality one of those types of people and,0.12293364
but at the same time she does have that kind of sensitivity to her and,0.08671729
she does have that kind of jacked out of you know am I getting too,0.31089434
old to play these same parts over and over again you know she's still successful,0.10852986
but as far as her own eyes are concerned and what she sees in the,0.09185358
mirror she can tell that she's getting old or getting older at least and Eve,0.1437022
is a young doe-eyed woman who is besotted with Margo Eve Harrington she goes to,0.40871003
see Margo at the play that she's currently performing in every single day multiple times,0.084306166
a day you know she'll see all the performances and she gets taken in she's,0.14865164
outside of the theater at the beginning of the movie she gets taken in by,0.100016125
Margo's friend like come and meet her you know if you're such a big fan,0.112221636
we'll come and see her backstage oh no no I couldn't possibly you know Eva's,0.23773365
very meek but she goes backstage and she meets Margo who kind of takes takes,0.22326726
a bit of a liking to it we kind of get to hear Eve's backstory,0.06337164
about losing her husband and she kind of you know tells him where she is,0.21824598
now in her life and it isn't a very nice story so Margo takes pity,0.25787717
on even says come with me and you can be my assistant and so Eve,0.094858564
is very happy and very glad to take on the the mantle of assisting Margo,0.19014803
in any way she can now Margo already has an assistant kind of called birdy,0.19080481
played by thalma Ritter and birdy doesn't really trust eat when she comes into the,0.07245811
fold and you know very much takes a quick distrust stance to Eve and everything,0.08212502
that she seems to be standing for she kind of comes into the you know,0.21269561
in into the that the family of actors and this this theatre life Thelma Ritter,0.10268566
is an awesome actress I love her in everything I've seen her and she has,0.031199472
such character to us she has such a strong essence and I see things in,0.07700783
her that I've seen in women I've known growing up my life and I'd be,0.31089434
very surprised if they'll maritza and real life wasn't what you would call maybe a,0.23971464
tough broad you know she she just has such character to her and it's no,0.15494634
different in this film to she's such a joy to watch and I liked how,0.09971612
birdies kind of you know kind of just looking around the corner you know kind,0.095741555
of so to speak even and what Eve is doing in the household anyway so,0.044953685
this the story is about Margo and it's about Eve what I love about this,0.055746973
film such a great move we open with a scene at an award ceremony a,0.02957845
very kind of upper-class kind of posh kind of award ceremony for theater actors you,0.25784266
know very posh stuff and we see these people sad the tables we see Margo,0.18315336
we see the character played by George Sanders I forget his name and he's kind,0.05091597
of a theater critic and he's a very very vital character in the story and,0.07147592
we kind of hear this narration that's setting up what we're about to see which,0.036691844
is the this prestigious award being given to Eve Harrington so the film kind of,0.052650698
spoils at the beginning the Eve goes on to being actress herself and so I,0.08274723
think the real crux of this movie as it progresses and as it goes on,0.10336837
is you thinking as the audience what are Eve's motives what is she really in,0.085367784
this for you know it's birdie right to distrust her you know or we just,0.11475762
thinking the worst along with her - and I love that about it and I,0.33002034
love that really Eve isn't in the film that much I mean she's in it,0.121045
plenty but if you were to take that to our running time and really look,0.060168315
at how many minutes she's on screen it's not I don't think as many as,0.090722956
you would expect for someone whose name is in the title of the movie I'd,0.07138796
say Margo gets the lion's share of screen credit of the screen time and I,0.018125871
guess screen credit but it's more about it it's it's in the title All About,0.04857533
Eve let me tell you all about Eve before she gets up to the stage,0.060938172
to accept the award that they make the beginning of the film before we've even,0.02762483
seen her on screen we flash back to to Eve outside the theater and being,0.031624895
brought in to meet Margo and we see the whole story progressed at the very,0.029485626
end of the film we see Eve except the award and so we get to,0.038940545
see how that's that kind of that sequence that that's that series of events leads,0.06549532
us to her receiving this award loves how they did it a really cool framing,0.078364044
device but also just how we really get a feeling of Eve through other characters,0.062359314
perspectives and how they feel about how what they think about what she's doing you,0.14293239
know she becomes an assistant to Margo and then you know things progressed from that,0.08421422
I don't to spoil too much more of what happens even though I kind of,0.09030648
told you what happens at the beginning which in in effect kind of tells you,0.06779909
what happens at the end but it's all about the journey to that destination and,0.04287833
how it happens why it happens and and what kind of gets destroyed in the,0.2935836
process Bette Davis is unbelievable as Margo Channing I had one of my favorite performances,0.10918047
I think she's so full of fire in this film you know there's some really,0.32186723
great incredible writing in the film which only lends itself well to insanely quotable lines,0.093480095
from the film one that really stood out to me that actually I noted down,0.051389713
just so I got a completely ripes I didn't want to paraphrase it and get,0.16101876
it wrong I have it here on my phone when Margo is having a particularly,0.15351406
kind of feisty back and forth with someone she says everyone has a heart except,0.08392146
for some people that's just a killer line that's such a great line and there's,0.27312788
some really funny witty moments in the film there's a character played by Marilyn Monroe,0.04077183
who's this kind of ditzy blonde an aspiring actress she isn't very good and you,0.31387123
know the George Sanders character says well you can just go to television you know,0.08151185
and she says tell me did they have auditions for television and he replies that's,0.07282263
all television is my dear she's just fantastic line there's lots of kind of funny,0.11384203
moments in the film but you're still really invested in this story and what happens,0.04552131
and and and and how the characters kind of combust and and into play and,0.06581941
everything and it's an incredible cast of characters and some great actors obviously Marilyn Monroe,0.07652502
I still haven't really seen anything in Maryland where I haven't seen her most famous,0.07499269
films I don't know if she a good actress I couldn't tell you anything about,0.24935327
her but the seer in this film was fun but she's a very small role,0.24169803
and Baxter as Eve you know knowing what happens throughout the whole course of the,0.03190915
film and what her character is where she's from why she's doing what she's doing,0.11259678
her performance gets even better once you can know all that backstory you know because,0.15365879
again she seems so meek and innocent at the beginning and and then to see,0.10780894
where her true her true intentions lie and how that manifests itself I thought was,0.38319853
was super bleep laid by Anne Baxter now apparently Anne Baxter kind of put herself,0.336721
forward to be nominated for the the Best Actress Award and they were going to,0.017565068
put her for Best Supporting but Bette Davis was also at for Best Actress and,0.062484764
so the the general consensus or the the belief is that by having both of,0.050270483
them competing for the Best Actress Award kind of cancel each other out and neither,0.07338719
of them won which I think it's kind of a travesty cuz I think Bette,0.4366592
Davis her name was all over that Oscar I think she did an amazing job,0.064230464
in this film she's so so good at being you know being angry and spiteful,0.5154597
but showing that vulnerability in a few moments you know you really see the the,0.07626013
hearts and the humanity of this woman I really thought the way the film was,0.23340808
starting she would be kind of a cold uncaring character but there is there is,0.10675034
a lot of heart to Margo and I think that Bette Davis really made that,0.053611938
character even better than it could have been if someone else had played it I,0.078372404
think and another great kind of little bit trivia that I noted down as well,0.25809163
was that her boyfriend in the film bill I think his name was the actor,0.10056695
Gary Meryl I'm not sure if they kind of hooked up while making the film,0.09047908
or if they were already together but you know soon after this they got married,0.063796684
and soon after the film came out All About Eve Bette Davis implored Joseph L,0.019477315
mankiewicz to write a sequel to All About Eve that would focus on the characters,0.14656752
of Margo and Bill it was built and played by her lover on and off,0.22059838
screen Gary Merrill many years later after she and Meryl had married and divorced Bette,0.051716283
Davis ran into mankiewicz at a party and said to him Joe you can forget,0.16461088
about that sequel I played it out and it doesn't which is another fantastic story,0.050859313
but you can really see the chemistry between the two Celeste home was very good,0.0411025
in the film too I think the only real weak link in the film is,0.0825152
Hugh Malo who plays Lloyd Richards the the the playwright who Rahu's who's written the,0.0652496
play that Margo is currently starring in he's okay but he kind of really stands,0.09629845
out like a sore thumb amidst all this amazing acting going on with everyone else,0.2705656
around him so he really does kind of stand out a bit as not being,0.18529716
as great as the other members of the cast great acting fantastic writing are really,0.06481033
tightly kind of paced and plotted and edited and and shot story that just keeps,0.15012029
you hooked throughout the entire duration I just was so intrigued to see how Eve,0.0716064
Harrington got to that point where she was winning this award and and I just,0.05874926
I loved it I thought was an amazing film is it fun we should see,0.0925993
before you die it absolutely is how you know criticism of art but also how,0.31242463
this character but played by George Sanders he he was using his kind of status,0.08230714
as a critic of the theater in the wrong ways you know for the wrong,0.09472937
reasons and and and looking at something like that and how people like that do,0.104347385
have power in situations in circles like for that because you're looking at these characters,0.078922175
in the old they all live in this bubble of the theater you know you,0.19166821
have George Sanders he's a theater critic we have the playwright you know we have,0.06443321
all these people who act as the actors the assistants so I liked seeing just,0.11290827
that that world even though it doesn't really look at the the actual theater stuff,0.061454885
itself we never really see stuff on stage as far as the actual play is,0.06270706
concerned there's a brilliant scene set on this a theatre stage but it doesn't really,0.056771517
delve into the craft of that but more just the people who are involved in,0.06453315
it and their lives outside of it you know but how it's still the theater,0.080628105
is looming larger of everything they do it's it's their life but I like how,0.077032
you know we saw the outside of that and just kind of that the human,0.19431359
interactions outside of this performance and also again as I was saying I love how,0.09172849
everything is framed from other people's perspectives and remembrances of Eve how they came in,0.05641063
to how she came into their lives and how she ultimately got to the place,0.12353006
that she is at the beginning and end of the film so I think that's,0.08945773
about as much as I can say I hope it's been a right again I,0.09000353
just feel like this film was so great that I just I really needed to,0.06405184
do a good job of reviewing it and maybe I'm just overthinking that it doesn't,0.07479017
really matter but you can tell I love the film obviously and I highly would,0.06926599
highly recommend you seeing I'll watch it on Netflix so if it's still on Netflix,0.06797355
go check it out you can it's a click of a button away and it's,0.18839286
