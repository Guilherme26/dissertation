today based on a recommendation of a former student alfred Bowden I watched portrait of a lady on fire from 2019 Cecile how do you say her name Celine Scorsese that's the level of filmmaking we have going on here Celine Shyama I'm sure I brutalized the pronunciation of that anyway this movie is on an isolated island in a Brittany at the end of that's like off the coast of France or and like yeah at the end of the 18th century so when it's the 18th century what are we in now we're in the 21st century so the 18th cent so I was like the late 1700s I always get confused by that because I'm dumb anyway a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman that young woman's sister has recently died and the mother is also once the painter essentially to keep an eye on her we need to name these characters because it's all women and I'll just end up saying she she sent up saying she she she so are the painter that comes is oh my god no me mmm Mariano yeah yeah yeah and and that's that's Maryanne and then Adele hey Nell yeah yeah yeah these are all French people is Eloise Eloise who is the woman to be a painted yeah those are the two characters that we really need to know about except there's another there's a hot woman who works in the house named Sophie and that's played by Liana dorami [ __ ] me dude I don't know how to read any of these names it's my fault I know anyway I'll learn them eventually okay so this is a lesbian movie that's when I said that I was gonna watch it my roommates girlfriend was like oh that's a real lesbian movie and I was like yeah okay yeah no she wasn't saying like in a negative way but I was like yeah I kind of get that feeling anyway it's about a cat so many things look at all these notes I took took like serial killer level notes here so what makes it fascinating is that the young woman kalenna or no Heloise sorry Eloise whatever she she doesn't to sit for the painting because basically the completion of the painting means it's that that she must be Wed to this guy in Milan she doesn't want to do it she's never even met him she never been to Milan she's never done anything really she's just been in the in like a nunnery or coven coven covenant she was in a coven of witches yeah so she she only knows like like she knows nothing basically she and she's very resilient against this idea of marriage and being married off and not having her freedom and you know at least there are books and like church music at the coven so you know she and then and then our painter Marianne she's like free you know she doesn't she her father was a painter and she'll take over his business and she's could paint her portrait artist you know and so she does have freedoms and slowly marianne falls in love with Eloise and maybe she returns to love I won't spoil it everything I say will be like I won't say anything after like the first hour of it you know so there won't be too many spoilers so since since Eloise refuses to sit for the painting Marianne has basically been brought in under false pretenses to be like oh she's gonna just watch after you and take you on walks and stuff she's gonna be like you're a chaperone and your guardian and just like a friend until the wedding when in actuality it's obviously like you know so you know that like I don't know what I thought was so good I can't even read my handwriting I just feel like I should just straight-up read it like instead of trying to read it quickly so it's basically perfect writing because they don't need to say anything and within like a two minutes of the movie I knew kind of almost everything that was gonna happen but in a and I know I've said that before as a negative but this and like it's like in the best way like because a lot of movies they tell you what they're gonna the movies gonna be about and then while it's being about that they're telling you look if look what I'm being about and then at the end it goes look what I was just about look what you just saw and tells you all about what you just saw like everything is handed to you whereas these the best type of movies you go oh oh yeah all right here we go there's here we go this is obviously going to be a love story and it's obviously a tragic love story because not nobody's happy and just the [ __ ] music and the way people are acting and the the color of the sky you can just tell the filmmakers all I can go and then we know the time period and know that you know society's inversion to various forms of sexuality other than biblical makes people upset so you just kind of know that and then and then any relationship that's starts on a lie or a deception is gonna eventually come to the head so we know all that stuff and it's like oh my god I can kind of like even predict the feeling I'm gonna have when this movie ends but different than like a [ __ ] Transformers movie where you're like okay this and this and the cubes gotta go here and then obviously that's gonna happen and this person said I don't like eating hot dogs and at the end they're gonna have to like eat a hot dog so the bomb doesn't go off because it'll be a hot dog between him and the bottom line right push it with his nose you know so it's not that it basically starts and goes this is what the movie is gonna be about just by like setting up the vibe and then it doesn't say look it's about that it just is it just unfolds which is which is what the big difference is and since our protagonists like needs to remember her subjects face for later the audience becomes fixated on all the little details it's like a genius writing device you know and make sense within the story and within the way it's shot and it's movie where you kind of like I just said he kind of know where everything is gonna go before it happens but magically it like works anyway and you know that it's a tragic love story forbidden that there's like suicide in the backdrop and like there's always a storm kind of coming that kind of feeling and some films suffer from this in a bad way and they forecast everything that's gonna happen and I just think that this is the much better way I mean it just kind of was redundant and how I said that but yeah once it like you just let it unfold and you just burgeoning friendship it's like gets you interested in its it is two hours and it is slowly paced but it should be there's a you know it should I didn't feel like that I mean maybe Kylie out in a few minutes but probably not I don't know it seemed all there to me seemed like it was the right length I don't know like basically so I wrote this note down and then like a second later they stay like confirmed what I said like they set it up so that they don't have to say anything and you just get it it's like music like it's just like if someone might not be able to describe but within the first like five seconds of an Elliot Smith song even a little kid can go oh it's like a sad song right like it you can just tell it's not and within you know three notes of a Chuck Berry song you know oh it's gonna be like a rock and roll like jumping around kind of song you know and and sometimes it's hard to describe that especially the intricacies of music and so the second I said that they the character asks oh you know it says something about music and I was like oh my god my ears pricked up I was like that she's like well you know you get to I'm gonna go to church listen to music and although you never heard an orchestra before have you and she's like no and and then she goes what's what's orchestra music sound like and she goes it's not easy to relate music and it's like wow and then later that's a thing like where it's like impossible to relate like your love for somebody in words and then in the film then goes on to showing like through actions how it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing it's not really three acts it's like a midpoint that's what I feel like or maybe it's five acts you know it's either like I don't know because at the midpoint it like reak the movie kind of restarts not not literally but we get like kind of a fresh I don't know I don't want to spoil anything but that makes it sound like there's some Shama Lani and twist like at out one our 100 the alien comes down and transport them all to Planet lady on fire now it's it's great it's amazing and it says it's like this feminist beacon type movie without pounding it you know like into the ground or even have it like saying it you know but at one point you realize oh look this this image right here is showing like a functioning family of all women you know like two women and then like a younger woman like that's kind of representative of a child like they're doing everything fine like there's complete harmony here there's baby there's basically no men in the whole movie and the ones that are in there are like I'm here to eat okay boy you know great so it's all it's almost like how women are treated in almost every other movie it's just like we need you to be there you know I don't know so it's great I would see it I was expecting it to be more graphic you know because my most recent French lesbians extravaganza movie was probably you said French I think blue is the warmest color and that is like 30 minutes of that is like hardcore pornography I think I think that movie is actually beautiful and not that way guys but it is when I movie ended I was like kind of kind of like know what it must be like to be a teenage lesbians like going through like making the decision or coming coming to light anyway yeah everybody in this movie the cast is amazing the writing is amazing directions amazing it's just top-notch in every way and I really like that that like the biggest like element of it that I like is that how you end up having to study the characters in the way a painter would have to and how all the characters are like fully represented and they're not just there to serve the story like they have a life outside of the movie and within the I don't know whatever just [ __ ] watch it's on Hulu you bastards it's not as long it's not like brutal yet like I we've talked about this a lot but like once the pacing I understand this once a movie gets over a certain like or if it's just not paced - it's something you're used to then you start going this is boring and that's that makes sense that's by design because you're used to all right I don't want to [ __ ] talk about this anymore all right let's see what happens if I push this button we get in sound I'm I'm like I'm afraid of doing something in anyway [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I probably should put a camera somewhere where you can see what I'm doing I don't even know what I'm doing yet that's new set up is it's not fully there yet okay yeah watch this movie is very good
