thanks to curiosity stream for supporting crash,0.15448664
course hello as you might have noticed I'm not Craig or Lilly my name is Michael Aranda and I'll be your host for the last third of crash,0.2382827
course film now since we're getting to know each other,0.060641248
let me ask you a question what's your favourite film maybe there's a movie that makes you want to get fit or become a spy or save the world,0.09252627
or maybe you love anything that zoe saldana is in because she's just the coolest films can have an awesome story or sloppy lighting dazzling special effects or characters who are just straight-up stereotypes,0.115188174
all these things can affect how you feel about a movie or whether you'd give it a thumbs up on Netflix because that's a thing now but they can also affect how it fits into cinema history and impacts the world around us,0.069065824
well think critically about a lot of different movies starting with an American classic,0.10283557
that many people call the greatest film ever made it came from ambition,0.113722734
and some unusual circumstances with Orson Welles at the helm and even though it's been a long time since its release,0.047819667
in 1941 the film's technical cleverness and stories still resonate with audiences,0.07578293
today I am talking of course about Citizen,0.06622916
Kane calling Citizen Kane,0.08945509
one of the best films of all time is a complicated claim to make to be honest the idea of ranking movies and making a top 10 list may be fun,0.050849896
but it's not what film criticism is really about,0.0994981
it's about thinking deeply about how the movie works both to us as an audience member and within history in society,0.0839856
it's about understanding deconstructing feeling and learning so is Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made,0.06732029
well we can't answer that because that's not the question we should be asking but there's clearly something about it that sticks with us,0.061682504
and maybe that something is its origin story Orson Welles was hoisted into the spotlight at the right young age of 23 when he was performing with the Mercury Theatre Company a troupe that he helped create in 1938 Welles directed and narrated the radio drama the War of the Worlds,0.06495114
and supposedly struck fear into some listeners who thought that an actual alien,0.21475357
invasion was happening,0.21207002
we know,0.046632066
now that in the early years of the 20th century this world with being what closely by intelligences greater than man but he also caught the attention of studio execs at RKO one of the five film studios that reigned during the Golden Age of Hollywood not only that but they gave him complete creative control which was like really unusual at the time,0.11886756
so he did what any plucky artist in his mid-20s would do,0.08083628
he packed up his stuff and invited his buddies from the Mercury Theatre Company to come with him to Hollywood now I don't want to sell them short this was a group of very good actors and despite his lack of experience with the movie industry Welles lept into this project with a lot of ambition performing experience and fresh ideas,0.27525976
he wanted to be involved in his many aspects of the film as possible from directing to starring as the film's eponymous Charles Foster Kane Welles filled out his production team with other talented men from Hollywood who were itching to experiment with their craft people like Gregg Toland a cameraman who contributed a lot to the film's look and technical innovation,0.088047914
and Welles is credited as co-writer with Herman J mang kovitch a journalist who hopped over into the world of filmmaking and was an experienced screenwriter by the time he worked on this project,0.13937806
Citizen Kane tells the life story of a wealthy newspaper magnate,0.05952031
the first time we meet Kane he's on his deathbed in a massive mansion called Xanadu dramatically murmuring,0.3079896
his last word the story is told in flashbacks through interviews with people Kane once knew like his friend and fellow reporter Jedediah Leland his business manager mr. Bernstein and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane in the last sequence of shots we find out that rosebud is referencing a sled,0.056885127
he had as a kid before he was separated from his family and sent to boarding school with a new guardian,0.18231487
so Citizen Kane could be a story about well a lot of things a loss of childhood human flaws memory or the complications of power and wealth film criticism is pretty subjective,0.08536371
but Citizen Kane is also a story that was influenced by real life,0.06669777
specifically tycoons like the news mogul William Randolph Hearst while Welles insisted the film wasn't meant to be a personal attack on Hearst all of the parallels,0.22851713
and the fact that mang kovitch was a former friend of Hearst made him take the film real personally,0.19060981
and when you have a buttload of money and power over lots of news outlets your grudges become public fast initially RKO and Orson Welles planned on debuting Citizen Kane at the Radio City Music Hall like other big RKO movies but the venue turned it down,0.15423298
eventually the film's release was delayed until May 1st 1941 in New York,0.023945555
and the critical reception was actually pretty good a review by Kate Cameron published on May 2nd in the New York Daily News called Citizen Kane one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio the controversy did mess with the film's commercial success though it didn't gain much public traction until it was released again in the 1950s so part of what makes Citizen Kane memorable is that it was an ambitious project headed by a maverick filmmaker and had a lot of drama around its release,0.0668034
we humans do love ourselves some drama,0.14920364
but the content of the film speaks for itself to the creators of Citizen Kane had the freedom to play and innovate,0.05079737
many of their technical experiments changed the way film was being used as a storytelling medium which arguably could be another way to define greatness,0.041717913
it takes a keen eye to notice some of these tricks or at the very least some good commentary tracks a lot of the innovation had to do with cameras Greg Tolin the cinematographer helped pioneer the use of deep focus lenses,0.053077597
so that everything in a scene is in focus at once not just the foreground or the background Citizen,0.07376017
Kane doesn't use focus to guide your attention in a scene instead things like dialogue or movement,0.09982718
draw your eye to certain people at certain times,0.1866002
it's very much like theater where Welles had honed his directing and acting jobs,0.11398508
they use perspective to surprise you like to mess with your sense of scale when Kane walks toward a normal-looking background only to be dwarfed by a huge window or fireplace it's a neat visual effect,0.13637932
but it also punctuates the story with a little metaphor,0.054109287
you're seeing this man physically shrink into his environment as he's losing control over his business and life and camera movements are combined with other practical effects to really immerse you in the story take the scene where Cain as a kid playing in the snow or his parents are inside a cabin and talking about sending him away the camera pulls back through a window and eventually stops on the other side of a dining table but from the final framing you can see that the table would have been in the way of the movement,0.093802795
the trick is in the set,0.05456839
it's actually a mechanical table that splits and comes back together,0.16279759
so the Me's onset is never broken and the scene can keep playing out,0.07345894
you,0.10154687
the viewer are none the wiser because you're wrapped up in the incredible illusion of the reality the film is constructed other practical tricks are used,0.06273126
in the Enquirer office where Cain's newspaper staff works these scenes were unusual for movies at the time because there are visible ceilings,0.06163272
now this doesn't sound that weird because you know normal office buildings have ceilings but production teams usually stuck lights and sound equipment above their actors heads so to keep the movie magic intact they had to keep ceilings out of frame in this case the lights and microphones are still up there just hidden right above the ceilings which are made of muslin sheets they also cut out chunks of the floor to make room for the camera so they could get dramatic low angle shots making the actors look larger-than-life the trick to Citizen Kane is that all these effects which are everywhere don't feel like effects in the same way,0.08398752
a CGI dragon does they subtly draw you into the world for instance wells often blends mat,0.07912775
drawings with physical sets to make everything seem more immersive despite a limited budget this is how they create the beginning of the film leading us toward the window of Xanadu and Kane's death bed plus it's how they make the inside of Xanadu,0.089099854
the outside of the Inquirer Building and the audience's during the big campaign speech and opera these tricks,0.07011969
were accomplished with optical printers which let them shoot in light two images are seen separately and stitch them into one effects also let them add visual twists to the story in ways Wells couldn't with live theater like when Susan Alexander is performing in the Opera we crane up from the stage and fade into the rafters to see the operas production,0.11823729
team reacting to how awful her performance is the transition is precise and deliberate and nowhere near as easy as dropping a fade into a digital video editor today,0.25846604
now maybe you noticed some of these technical tricks but they're done well not obvious unless you're paying close attention,0.101869546
and that's one of the coolest things about good filmmaking,0.08798582
but a lot of the time what makes our favorite movies so memorable is just a well-told story and if you think about it Citizen Kane doesn't really have a mind-blowing plot,0.07906533
it's a straightforward tale about a powerful wealthy newspaper tycoon and his shortcomings and the dialogue is all pretty crisp and generic you get a newsreel summary of Kane's life at the beginning but it's mostly told through flashbacks and they're part of what makes the film feel so true to life,0.058309607
and even though it's easy to link Charles Foster Kane with William Randolph Hearst,0.05319588
this archetype of a driven powerful jerk who just wants people to love him is pretty relatable to a lot of us even Welles himself,0.7694855
so you might see things you like and hate about yourself in Kane or Susan Alexander's naive optimism or Jedidiah Leland and his disillusionment with a friend honestly,0.2984641
the fact that it's his childhood sled isn't the most profound or surprising twist out there,0.08873554
it's not like they're hidden identities or I see dead people but you have to admit the film goes all-in on the idea of lost childhood Kane drowns his feelings and material objects and tries to live vicariously through Susan Alexander's youth,0.18871012
telling her we're going to be a great opera star,0.09528401
or maybe you agree with the film critic Pauline Kael that the sled is just kind of gimmicky but critics including her don't call Citizen Kane great because it makes you realize profound things about life the universe and everything every scene isn't a masterpiece but the film holds up over time and people seem to get a lot out of it historically technically or narrative Lee and like I mentioned before the whole idea of the best film of all time is ultimately kind of silly it's more about understanding why and how we make movies that mean so much to us or to the world and that is pretty beautiful in itself next time we'll take a hard left turn into an action-adventure horror film that's almost as quotable as Casablanca James Cameron's aliens and if you want to watch along with us there's a full list of movies in the description crash,0.14865203
