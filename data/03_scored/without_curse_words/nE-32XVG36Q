simple story a story based film and I think of all the films that are,0.06617149
just stories there isn't one better craft to December sunrise late in history sever time,0.043348234
I might be the best crafted movie of all time I'm not saying that there,0.05817349
wasn't films I prefer more but a more flawed I'm not even saying that there,0.114024356
isn't better mid movies because there is but I think that better movies that exist,0.09899769
of like art movies I think something is just a story and I think even,0.074070096
at me was it a better made don't tell their stories well after the Sun,0.06271324
right Samsung might tell its story perfectly and everything aware it is fantastic he made,0.06496276
the editing cuts on action at perfect moments the camerawork is dynamic he's roaming it's,0.110422954
moving the action is sometimes slow sometimes fast naturalistic controlled everything is so perfectly aligned,0.09239405
the story is so well developed that hope does God feel really good arcs it's,0.060341842
really really well put together the other questions I can levy on it are best,0.10403151
if we just knit picks and really really mine and it picks at that so,0.04595103
let's just move where for now let's look at one of the things that's so,0.05363961
great about is just the characters the characters here are iconic like absolutely iconic I,0.05327354
think there's no question here that some of them have gone down in legend the,0.071269624
leaves I'm like kambei is this a jade humble dignified samurai who has seen a,0.16366225
lot of death he's take a fight in and throughout the course of the movie,0.31388113
he would sit more fight in and I think he kind of is the Sun,0.17142834
even the glue the whole summer summer together he's the character who we always respect,0.043380264
and we respect the fact that he sees this lost not was a good thing,0.14967029
even if it's for a noble purpose but really this damn character in some way,0.794439
is kikuchiyo who is one of the first characters ever put to cinema and he,0.08612377
is one of the best actors want the best arc in cinema the couch it's,0.060313396
a fantastic character he starts off the movie being kind of a laughable fake samurai,0.42456844
he's not excited by the others he's a triangle among the circles he's not the,0.25440264
some way that they respect he's someone who's just a fake his swords oversized his,0.46081838
papers a wrong he's a liar and his lover born is ridiculous and everyone makes,0.83777297
a mockery of him who thought the film they learned to respect it by the,0.3930067
end of the film he has reached the level of Bentley penis I might accepted,0.8122072
as of summer like they expected or something like he gets the same treatment as,0.09124315
a song like he is a samurai despite the fact that he starts off to,0.09896953
be such a laughable fake and there's two moments that define him that ever I,0.5078477
mean with best moments in the film at one point kikuchiyo holds a crying child,0.13373917
while a house behind him burns and I think he at that point he realizes,0.44350404
how far he's come from what he started and I said really keep one for,0.093888834
him on the sudden who he is and what how he's changed and I think,0.13238442
they have a really great point for the future it's a speech midway through the,0.09557485
film well he bakes a samurai for their snobbery towards a farmers or for their,0.26040262
I can give at the farmers and I think it's the best moment in a,0.053479917
film thought of so many fantastic moments it's not my her Cuchillo really reveals who,0.19118094
he is like not just in the literal sense in a very much he reveals,0.15494736
how he feels he the facade has gone and he perfected something right for the,0.08002309
society they leave it for the responsibility in the oppression that goes on the front,0.11001312
of samurai just looking down all those lower than them and for the idea that,0.17252582
the son might have sought wonderful and I think coochie is kind of revelation here,0.1547778
that he doesn't find all of them expecting this I'm right he's really kind of,0.14733167
interesting because that's something he seems to want to be and it's such a fantastic,0.066736676
moment the bricks apart the fell I think it's a moment well look the violet,0.087447464
world around them we see the clarity this is a phone with a bandit sort,0.23960763
of bad guys but there's a point to myth about how the bandits and the,0.35101226
Sun might both leave the cycles of violence that oppressed the peasants it's not just,0.17253935
the pundits who have long in this world and so kikuchiyo lay in that bear,0.12933406
in such a brutal honest fashion the bricks the heart the other characters is such,0.13775584
a fantastic moment in a film that really has so many others but isn't really,0.055829138
count if I were to fill about groups individual don't do you mean much to,0.15082553
this family to feel about a group dynamic so for example the titular taro something,0.084947206
I must be aren't really developed or define but what is define is how everyone,0.0769089
function doing a group we know how the team works even if we don't know,0.09504602
how individuals work and I think what's really important is sometimes I feel about groups,0.07917645
we're curious how I die max his film he has the groups of characters that,0.30022475
move and they even moved he ever unify all split apart and separate and coach,0.06626958
always all of our movement I mean they're film exploring natural movement main wind but,0.10466938
he constantly muses clouds and he constantly uses groups it's about group mentality it's not,0.19076176
about individuals in this film so it's a film where we have peasant versus some,0.15415028
my versus bandits everyone is a separate group never one is expected to for those,0.13927816
world you want to be a Bundy or a farmer or peasant over some way,0.29473135
or wife you know meant to be anything else and so this is a film,0.15134996
where everyone goes into predefined roles in the society as soon as we see this,0.08428802
quite okay we see it wouldn't character who fixed time I will defile his daughter,0.26805076
who's a farmer and sir he gave me her not kind of emphasizes an ugly,0.68167466
truth to society when defined in a way it shows the follows a feudalism that,0.1028094
follows of classifies of privilege it shows how bad they can be and so Seven,0.15036786
Samurai really is a film about the group mentality it's about how people work a,0.11205074
collectivist that it's not about individuality and that's kind of something that makes it a,0.07793984
bit different to films of just like a singular action hero the other thing is,0.1031206
that this is also a hair of those two very traditional hair and narrative the,0.05659366
the seven song right don't necessarily strike whose heroes in heavenly but what they have,0.05440614
is a moral character they're fighting to protect one village it's a very small scale,0.09072384
story just seven song with a woman village it's almost gotten difficult in a way,0.09602534
I think because if I was a judge I caught your consciousness it has become,0.15160252
a myth really the story that Seven Samurai you've saved a village for no reward,0.07026603
and great cost because almost in Heroes is that they're more character says that even,0.048845205
though there is no cost and their glory to this they will fight to the,0.07725293
death then they do fight to quite literally a bad end for a lot of,0.38662758
them fill all of these variations on this idea the actions are always seen and,0.09653629
when it is seen there's often a lot associated with it fighting isn't always novel,0.043512087
and fighting does lead to death if item does lead to suffering and as much,0.2192167
as the fighting here is justified because you've got to see if the peasants and,0.29450333
the bandits there's certainly a task Forte what keys interesting I fixed I'm saying right,0.26590472
it's just a master view like obviously everyone on planet earth who's seen this film,0.14789733
thinks is a masterpiece all they should do at least because it's so obviously is,0.104657255
it among films it is just perfectly put together it's a story which is really,0.07374546
what Paul is never once boring it's fantastically develop the characters are so likable and,0.1160169
if they aren't like people they're interesting the story is simple which we call a,0.11349846
mythos become an active everyone knows it it's inspired counts of us I mean America,0.1349474
did the Magnificent Seven we make it's absolutely groundbreaking it's absolutely astonishing it's a film,0.108466946
which holds up time and time again I watch it pretty much annually and every,0.06781401
single time I love it it's a feminist just it's magnificent and I don't know,0.52988493
what else it is to possibly say well Severus I'm like you don't want to,0.23995708
love words like perfect around because in all honesty nothing is ever truly perfect but,0.08261646
summer sign right you suppose it gets about as close to perfection as you can,0.058069218
get given what it is it does it pretty much perfectly so yeah it my,0.10118369
favorite a lot I know you know I'm not saying it is but there's very,0.055938356
few that are objectively better put together I think there's Seven Samurai and it's just,0.093306474
fantastic so yeah so something like obviously a classic I looked at your Faust in,0.19779164
