[Applause] everybody and welcome back to another movie night - movie review my name is,0.05502535
Dalton Burdette and today we're gonna be talking about nineteen fifty twos singing in the,0.078933194
rain this film stars Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and the great Debbie Reynolds and this,0.07297614
film was also directed by Gene Kelly one of the main stars and Stanley Donen,0.0010043156
this is a movie musical one of the classic movie musicals but also the plot,0.065959476
of this movie also just kind of wraps its way into movie history which is,0.10566957
the period of time where movies transition from being silent films to movies with sound,0.067331225
or talkies as they were called so it takes place in the late 1920s and,0.051827665
it's sort of really about like this Hollywood stardom opening scene of this movie is,0.11154574
brilliant one of the great things about this movie is its excellent use of comedy,0.11510062
and comedic timing and the way that it uses its exposition and I really liked,0.054202933
how there's a scene in this movie where these two characters you know gene Kelly's,0.09672519
main character and one of the annoying co-leads who that actress was also nominated for,0.11253335
Best Supporting Actress in this movie because she's so funny in it her name was,0.13876756
a Jean Hagen in real life anyway they're being interviewed and the interview is asking,0.15298341
him like I'll tell us about your story in your humble beginnings and while he,0.094331734
says things about how he went to this prestigious you know school and how he,0.11411566
started off by doing dance classes here in acting classes here it's actually narration /,0.077997416
flashbacks of what really happened in his life and it's him starting from it's like,0.12604125
a rags to riches story but you've seen conflicting narration with what's actually happening to,0.09682549
kind of show it not only sets the tone for what the feel of the,0.087637596
movie is which is comedic it shows his actual backstory and it gives insight as,0.053388324
to how the you know Hollywood make a machine influences how you have to be,0.0779814
in your public persona so it does just all of those things in one scene,0.09960231
and it was such an awesome and interesting way to go about doing that and,0.05243041
also speaking more towards the cast like Gene Kelly Donner will collar are great but,0.05301097
like Debbie Reynolds just what a national treasure Debbie Reynolds is like you're nothing but,0.15649848
a shadow on film a shadow you're not flesh the musical numbers in this film,0.15166222
are excellent I think that it's not only just the quick choreography of the dance,0.09870398
and lyrics of the songs but also just the cinematography and direction of said musical,0.02567996
scenes are really well done almost better than the actual scene themselves was just how,0.060572103
the musical scene was filmed and while the film does have a lot of really,0.008913245
well working comedy I think another great thing about this film is it's very deep,0.11408097
characters and how each each character sort of serves its own purpose to the story,0.037261844
but also is just a fundamentally different character you know gene Kelly's character is just,0.10773581
you know the main lead who is really tired of being taken over by the,0.17781547
Hollywood system you have to be Reynolds who's an up-and-comer who wants to get into,0.15817082
the Hollywood system and you have Donna O'Connor's character who is also a hugely funny,0.057948872
character whose role is to just be the best friend of Gene Kelly because they've,0.06334219
been best friends since they were growing up and just also you know always play,0.03280018
the piano be there and just kind of be that guy that is the you,0.15066713
know how about we do this you know that guy like that there's a role,0.099575356
in every friend group for that guy and this is what he does and I,0.13334663
know I keep you know being repetitive saying how well the comedy works in this,0.09945895
movie but this film is genuinely really funny and that's not something that gets talked,0.12837195
about very often when singing in the rain gets brought up since it's a musical,0.057484098
beavers talked about the music this film is hysterical but you have to in the,0.29542804
bush try it again she'll get it textured look cleaner don't worry we're all a,0.18952021
little nervous the first day everything's gonna be okay oh by the way Rosco you,0.13783456
know the scene coming up where I say imperious princess of the night I don't,0.106253125
like those lines there is it alright if I just say what I always do,0.056975886
I love you I love you I love you sure anyway it's comfortable but into,0.06992122
the bush okay again why but Dena we're missing every other word you've got to,0.06318899
talk into the mic all right all right and also just since I'm a sucker,0.6674607
for you know movies being about movies you know seeing the silent to talkie transition,0.05957554
happen and how Hollywood kind of freaks out and they take it more of a,0.4820325
comedic route with it but if that was just really fun to see portrayed in,0.05757121
a sort of fantastical musical style movie and you know the few scenes where you,0.09377696
get all three of them together especially when they're performing musical numbers it's just it's,0.066902235
pure cinematic magic it's wonderful as far for negatives about the film this film was,0.055007804
only like an hour and 43 minutes long but it does feel its length at,0.06652743
certain points or just means that there's an issue with the pacing and while it's,0.07864516
not a huge problem it is noticeable and this movie does kind of do things,0.078875616
for the sake of doing them and not necessarily for the benefit of this story,0.05501275
and look I understand the cinema of attractions I totally get it but like there's,0.075884186
a sequence where they have to rewrite one of their movies because it's just it,0.07997584
played horrible it was garbage and they're trying to figure out how to fix this,0.6107419
movie and Gene Kelly is like oh how about I pitched this musical number and,0.07317866
then it does the musical number that he's pitching to the producer and it's like,0.05031253
it's the biggest musical number in the movie it's long it's extravagant and it looks,0.06299398
beautiful and it was extremely well done like that's not the the point but but,0.0825213
like we were in such an integral part of the movie and then it just,0.050410308
like puts the plot aside and does this musical scene that is extremely long and,0.06482734
then it just cuts back to the producer and the producer is like ah yes,0.055084713
great idea and it's just like okay that that seemed just felt very misplaced to,0.08191312
me so I think just pacing and the you know very very small instances of,0.09817986
style over actual substance of what's going on can really hurt the movie but not,0.072048835
in a big way but it is noticeable and you know one more positive before,0.05563111
I end it as I'll say this movie is very thematic alia rich you know,0.19171719
the actual singing in the rain sequence it to a point where the lead character,0.036189467
is kind of having a rollercoaster of ups and downs throughout his career and you,0.15099402
know that scene really comes about to tell just the you know underlying story of,0.04343943
when you're dealt about hand when you have a bunch of horrible things happening around,0.39702216
you when it's raining outside just sing just make the best of what you have,0.079698496
and eventually you'll find happiness out of that and this movie does do a great,0.093276
job of reiterating that story in an underlying manner where it's not too in-your-face and,0.15819284
I like subliminal stories like that so overall I love singing in the rain I,0.07586399
think it's a wonderful musical movie I think the numbers are great I think the,0.065870814
characters are great the actors are great however I do think it's pacing could be,0.071371965
better and there are some scenes that are just there to be there and not,0.05758288
necessarily serve to the story or the characters but this is still a fantastic movie,0.032270364
and I'm going to give singing in the rain in a thank you guys so,0.06370254
