hey there this a match once again what about to another review this time of,0.07029208
a quiet place which got a lot of good reviews huge box office seems like,0.063626096
everyone loves the film and to be straight up I didn't mind the film but,0.071350016
that was okay that was alright I don't think I'd never see the film again,0.09196813
but I thought I had good acting it was a short film I mean you,0.15364769
take out the end credits it's like an hour and 24 minutes without the inbred,0.1817592
so it's not that one of a flake the premise is intriguing what if you,0.13136515
lived in a world would ya be quiet because these creatures hunt by sound intriguing,0.31089434
premise I like the idea that most of it is done with sign language made,0.04518486
for a different kind of movie prepare two movies of late so it separated stuff,0.08341003
a little bit by doing that I liked Emily Blunt as an actress I thought,0.10409765
she was really good at you tomorrow she does another nice job in this as,0.11244066
the lead John Krasinski he did fine as the husband / father he was also,0.13304746
the director of the film there are some good-looking shots showing the the farmhouse they,0.083682664
live at and I can't really say it's balli directed it is some good-looking shots,0.24140307
it wasn't tons of shaky-cam or too much piss-poor editing or anything of that ilk,0.44391134
so I did credit to the direction in the cast the ideas I mean compared,0.057428908
with horror films and leads I would easily put this above the new it movie,0.10766436
which are hated with that shitty new penny wise who did his Futterwacken dance where,0.90107197
the hell was I diesel II put this above something like sinister there was a,0.45877326
sinister sack of an easily put this above don't breathe which if it had likeable,0.5513623
characters and didn't have BS like the turkey baster full of where you stick up,0.32868
a couch if you didn't have crap like that maybe I will like don't breathe,0.7691638
more when I was really mixed on but if I had to choose I say,0.06375541
I would dislike it more than like it but I would put a quiet place,0.24222896
above that then have funny turkey basters won't come and villain that was pretty much,0.4454417
daredevil but there have been films in the past that dealt with hunting by sound,0.1265127
you had tremors love tremors when my favorite films ever and that was vibrations from,0.15317665
the ground so to really don't make noise or you'll die love tremors to death,0.5526734
you had the descent when they went to the cave these monsters didn't really hunt,0.41275203
by sight he lived in a cave they hunted by sound and I would easily,0.44801775
put tremors into the scent above this now the simple descent part to didn't go,0.09356431
itself scene where literally a monster shits on its main characters so I know that's,0.8334642
faint praise a quiet place is better than the descent part - it's one of,0.1047481
those things where I didn't the cast and they were good but something about this,0.054445483
movie just seemed so uneventful to me I don't know what it is like some,0.0909747
parts of the phone remind me a lot of signs by M night Shyamalan and,0.1181936
I was there brother watch signs despite the bolt the stupidity of the water but,0.77299315
why the where they come to a place if water was acid to them although,0.17309338
here there's a thing one Mike really okay I'll get to that but I don't,0.060459405
know just for some reason it just didn't feel that it's hard for me to,0.105120644
get stared at movie or anything I'm not saying that's the pump myself up it's,0.13206688
just one of those things and I just found a sort of uneventful I don't,0.051474813
know why it monsters on a farmhouse I mean I could watch critters for that,0.35464394
order will watch plenty of other movies for that the monster designed and doing it,0.31978065
for me they almost seem like the liquors from resident evil which they hunted by,0.16011713
sound to Ashley because they have eyes so there was only shitty liquors from Resident,0.8355208
Evil games so the monsters did impress me the the end beam was kind of,0.26399568
it wasn't downbeat it was just like wait that's how you don't end it like,0.07116311
you're waiting for like 10 15 more minutes apt and and then it ends you're,0.23271406
like what though that was lame I did it's an okay alright movie I do,0.3060945
feel some overrated film to CERN how much prep praise and it's one of these,0.12820303
things I'm getting tired of this this bullsh and what every horror film comes out,0.69542736
this is tears movie ever and I fainted and I had a heart attack oh,0.18882695
my god stairs every in two months they did they went for the witch the,0.4042318
babadook for the witch that movie you Baba dude I didn't see to be fair,0.51464564
but they different city is they did that for sinister which I'm like this police,0.37353694
I did they were stinking in every horror file that comes out now but yet,0.53350204
I if I go on Netflix I saw this one called the ritual last not,0.06723762
too long ago it came out last year on Netflix I liked the ritual a,0.08922502
lot I would easily put that above something like this I liked the story more,0.05980047
I like the the ending more I liked five I came out on Netflix like,0.11991405
the ritual put above this mmm but that's a film no one knows about zero,0.10033061
you know conversation well I I saw him when we recently called exists which I,0.09374526
reviewed it's a final footage bid for a movie sure but I like that feel,0.09162628
much more than this and FM that on my critics and no one saw us,0.13289748
about that film but that one I felt more events and felt more I would,0.047837775
just felt more like this one that and some of the that happened bud me,0.07158399
analyst let me die money on spoilers just discern how much money made it seems,0.3333351
like everyone saw the film and all is not a rant believe me if I,0.08371929
wanted to rant on it I'll rant on something Steve means it which everyone praised,0.15302376
from last year I rant on and cuz I thought it was a show a,0.082681775
sandwich I didn't want to eat but this one there in this empty town and,0.060112506
it's three kids Emily Blunt and her husband John Krasinski granted I don't know why,0.11345927
the they're bringing their kids around in the town why not just leaving the home,0.070660464
with the husband and the wife go out or leave him with the wife and,0.14510463
the husband go out I don't know why the you would take your kids the,0.3345354
Walgreens or where the you got one just just knows it'll be trouble it seemed,0.124288306
like they went out there for some supplies and medicine and again I'm thinking why,0.09221658
the are you taking everybody out you have this home and they even have this,0.23227671
like basement where well I guess technically ones like day 89 yells like a 400,0.13927369
something so maybe they didn't have the house yet I don't know maybe that's why,0.063809596
they didn't have the house yet I would assume they did is there taking all,0.063265204
this other electronic I don't know maybe they didn't Alamo they didn't really give me,0.108076334
much detail as to whether they had a house or not it just seemed like,0.07603933
we're like you're leaving your kid doing all this keep more of an eye on,0.21514991
your kid yeah or if you have a house stay there so what happens the,0.17519958
kids playing with this toy he just killed and the tiles come up because the,0.7700841
parents up it's Dave for enduring something they talked with sign language so no dialogue,0.12733576
not much dialogue in the film entirely that was an interesting idea I like that,0.05421994
it made it unique compared to again like I said compared to films recently that,0.05848684
was cool they have their dinner they play Monopoly the kid accidentally knocks his lantern,0.18719676
over and there's wandering and things coming for some reason this couple decide decided to,0.06896253
have another kid I guess oh my so wait a minute what this way that,0.13248563
is going in the world you decide to get pregnant again I'm like all right,0.22391437
does it make me ask twice about this world when you do you have silent,0.1495106
or do you put like a daddy in each other's mouths now maybe people with,0.43597674
no noise but or maybe they fought in the basement with the soundproofing I don't,0.058524486
know what does it make people why don't everyone just go and the soundproof all,0.090601705
the time like when you have dinner while you have dinner in the soundproofing basement,0.124830484
so you can get more leeway for dishes like why you want to do everything,0.18989144
the soundproof basement I'm just asking a question if this soundproof basement you worry about,0.056918763
noise just do everything there play your games there you know brought in technically live,0.07934994
in the basement of a soundproof but but then do you have sign on 14,0.07581928
do you with no noise it'd be hard to do and how you don't know,0.19178605
you know they do kind of quiet a babe I mean how the hell they,0.552741
don't quite a baby and then later on there is a baby oh you put,0.40359965
a mask on it and you put on the box I'm like well man you,0.23819178
should have had the baby in the first place then if you don't give it,0.31089434
a little mask and put it in a box as if you put away your,0.2634382
video games or something this little box but I might well this kid's gonna cry,0.24037597
a lot so in a world that you don't want noise I don't think being,0.14599694
pregnant should be you know something you should do especially within like the first year,0.093995705
of the going on do you think it was like Davey nine so that's almost,0.13839822
like three months and that's a year later given you know maybe five years and,0.04838642
then maybe try to have a kid just saying no just some stuff I'm like,0.10906308
so the dad tastes the kid to fishing and he says something like well we,0.0890466
can made noise here and he does a whoo-whoo because this waterfall I'm like this,0.15330881
waterfall okay why don't you just live by the waterfall then when you just live,0.44335502
by the waterfall live in a K by the waterfall or something but so they,0.099054195
have this apparently with the waterfall they they can't be heard because I guess the,0.06236225
waterfall I and the river is well not just a waffle but the river stops,0.07066356
there they're noise mainly the waterfall so this weird random what the scene honestly should,0.0827069
have been in the movie my opinion the dad Center coming back from fishing and,0.055377737
the waterfall scene and this random old guys there with this with and his wife,0.24075013
is dead the dad grows this literally the old god mace like lady ate some,0.42957175
bad like bad food oh he smelled like a ranked fart he's even like he's,0.7944734
an old man he's trying to find his teeth do I have teeth flat like,0.39620903
he made like a weird face that made me laugh like and then just how,0.3338718
blue this guy told me to shut up about he wasn't saying anything until the,0.4413369
guy went and then it's like and then of course they run and the creature,0.27859434
kills the old guy the was this scene about I didn't he was staring out,0.6051577
that was pretty funny like what the I was right and um Emily Blunt she's,0.15088394
by herself she's ready to give birth prematurely she tries to get down quit she,0.24128143
steps on the nail something falls she has to hide creature stalking her Emily Blunt,0.31270522
does a good job acting wise cinematography is nicely done she turns his faint on,0.2416246
red light to warn people the girl who play the daughter she felt bad for,0.2432956
what happened to her brother long ago and she's like at this little grave thing,0.28405303
sort of a spot to memorialize him and like bits that they do without dialogue,0.17565261
I still didn't they still gave the emotion of the characters - idea of that's,0.044645704
one of the things I could say that made me like the film ok overall,0.09309505
was the cat was the group of actors the use of sign language being that,0.07683345
sort of dealing with silence and having not much dialogue in it in the entire,0.16912565
movie at all I mean if there's ten lines of dialogue in the film that'd,0.06054041
be a surprise and I didn't that's one of the things that's intriguing about it,0.051912844
but then kids run around the cornfields I don't know that just made me think,0.08773296
of the film signs which I did I'd rather be watching signs she did birth,0.09945387
in this bathtub the father comes in they're alive the baby's alive they put this,0.44607806
little mass and they put the baby in a box turn the baby again the,0.31168842
basement is being flooded these kids are in the silo the dad tries it on,0.15664397
for the two kids he gets wounded he made some noise for self-sacrifice and I'm,0.29933426
thinking I know you're wounded but why are you at least try running or just,0.15497881
throw something don't run just you have a you dropped an axe why don't you,0.26164258
throw the axe that'll make some sound enough for the kids I get out of,0.23076338
there I mean it's gonna kill you in 30 seconds if you throw the actors,0.8606264
don't get there in 30 seconds so the self-sacrifice only was needed I get for,0.19529209
the emotional idea cuz the father the daughter when I seen eye to eye and,0.090864815
he sign languages I love you so I and emotionally I the emotional idea of,0.08942048
the story I did but it was like you just dropped a thing you try,0.15268716
thrown for the creature that go over there when these kids were in the silo,0.40336204
they were trapped and the creatures attacking them and when you see throughout this is,0.17634442
that the the little girl the girl has his hearing aid thing as high frequency,0.27507547
with the creature so after the dad's killed by so sacrifice that a mic I,0.39679155
think you've heard down something else in those the two T's did to the mom,0.18733233
they get to this place where the dad would try to radio or at least,0.09034345
see if there was any frequencies working the creature comes in again I'm not a,0.085786104
fan the creature design it was just very mediocre I'm not an original again it,0.44284993
looked like a shitty liquor from the resin Resident Evil games again they do hunt,0.86995995
by sound - just a generic look that's the worm what is a generic looked,0.49010566
on the creature I'm where I'm waiting for Jill Valentine to come out and shoot,0.6608578
the or Chris Redfield really I should say Chris Redfield or no well yeah res,0.09590827
evil five he fought them oh sure said Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield was the,0.24826866
first time my son wasn't evil to see IRA I'm talking more about that yeah,0.075643584
she said Leon Kennedy but she with the frequency and that messes up with the,0.1042611
creature I guess it makes part of its head exposed so that when Emily Blunt,0.22530398
shoots it with a shotgun a blows the head up CG I was in kind,0.7922164
of wish they'd gone for a more practical route cuz I know they had a,0.0835015
somewhat lower budget so the CGI wasn't on the creature and then I know my,0.10782781
friend Michael Keene mentioned this like how the is it that none of the scientists,0.12458228
in this world knew this frequency thing would work yet this little girl figures it,0.31413987
out fairly quickly and within one night and I'm like that would have been one,0.1079287
of the first things that scientists would have done like they hunt by sound oh,0.11946289
frequencies of course should have had us and then we've seen a lot of movies,0.09211019
why movies I deal with sound whether it be alien invasion movie suddenly usually does,0.2375079
were frequencies hell even Mars Attacks did that where they that yodeling music made their,0.42856303
heads blow up so alright just seemed like a pretty quick easy answer to the,0.3590319
problem and then the ending is that really an ending it's almost as if there,0.07954171
should be a to be continued because multiple creatures come in there are coming the,0.073236085
little girl gets the frequency you know equipment loaded up Emily Blunt costs the shotgun,0.2772451
and then the movie ends and I like so what now like what that's it,0.121278904
so I know it seems like I've been ranting a lot but I'm just throwing,0.15164815
out my nitpicks in there you cold nitpicks yeah but I'm just the one on,0.23974653
my nip it's in there and I think this Athene is that yeah every film,0.31089434
is without sin every film has their nitpicks it's just uh there's not gonna be,0.1016311
rant people don't say well you just don't want to ranches you don't want to,0.24202399
get in trouble please me I've got in trouble a lot many times in the,0.20700397
past and many times in the future I will this it wasn't like a terrible,0.18012784
time watching it wasn't like a board to sit through it wasn't oh my god,0.15426086
I hate these characters the characters were fine the acting was good the idea was,0.46466136
intriguing the directionless handled competently the lack of dialogue made it more interesting than the,0.070852235
norm and overall it was a enough movie that didn't feel like it was a,0.06403731
huge waste of time eighty some Menace boom you're out you know it's worth a,0.31361717
watch absolutely I just don't see why would ever we watch the film and I,0.0699039
would the idea not to put I would put tremors above it I put the,0.14916204
dissent above it overall it's an OK but I feel overrated film I didn't think,0.06933293
it was that Styria didn't think it was that suspenseful I didn't think it was,0.051864687
terrifying I thought the creatures were generic designs I know our pian this the third,0.08332233
time but they seem I'm lickers to me parts of the storyline huh and the,0.24286768
ending was just sort of a almost a ending anyway okay movie saw wands probably,0.30310807
never see it again that's a quiet place so either way thanks for watching take,0.05571049
