Impossible fallout hits theatres this weekend it stars Tom Cruise Rebecca Ferguson Ving Rhames Simon,0.14840902
Pegg Alec Baldwin Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett it is the sixth installment to the,0.057896852
mission impossible franchise written and directed by the same man who wrote the last film,0.12655666
rogue nation Christopher McQuarrie it is said to be an action-packed thrill ride by most,0.27398843
people a local fat black YouTube critic known simply by the alias BCG is planning,0.7038277
on reviewing this movie and giving it some type of review your mission should you,0.09987011
choose to accept it is to watch this review in its entirety and see whether,0.05014086
or not he does a great job of reviewing the film or completely watches it,0.06358699
this recording will now self-destruct in five seconds good luck agent hey guys the bike,0.24020019
critic guy and I'm here today to review the sixth installment to the mission impossible,0.07112331
franchise mission impossible fallout so the story for Mission Impossible fallout is relatively similar to,0.031845983
the one for rogue nation Ethan Hunt and his crew have to locate this secret,0.31089434
evil organization this time the call of the Apostles and stop them from obtaining 2-tone,0.35769615
iam in order to create a nuclear weapon to cause wanton destruction and while on,0.26406226
the way they face many obstacles like mi6 agents getting in their way the CIA,0.10844305
meddling with them once again and also being on their own and doing the impossible,0.10468386
god I cannot believe that this is the sixth installment to the mission impossible franchise,0.10027272
and that's been going on for this long keep in mind the first film of,0.07576396
this franchise came out in 1996 1996 22 years ago it still stars two of,0.07950604
the same actors from that film Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames have been in every,0.1325832
single Mission Impossible film and Ethan Hunt has always been the main character I mean,0.08628213
my goodness that is bonkers but the beauty of this franchise is that somehow some,0.27148247
way they get better with age it started with Ghost Protocol then it was followed,0.09519945
up by rogue nation which is still my favorite Mission Impossible film in the franchise,0.22511761
and now here we are with fallout which I personally find to be a solidly,0.043138564
made entertaining action blockbuster I noticed something very fascinating in regards to this latest installment,0.12697078
that being this is the truest sequel to any of the Mission Impossible films what,0.08886749
do I mean by that well basically whatever they make a new Mission Impossible film,0.11623719
that film does not directly connect or correlate to the previous installment it's its own,0.060332645
self-contained story but has the same characters from previous films so it's loosely connected but,0.046548314
it doesn't continue the same narrative whereas in Fallout it is a direct continuation -,0.06087077
rogue nation as it carries on the same narrative has many of the same characters,0.20801939
that were introduced in rogue nation and actually gives some closure to some of the,0.14190483
things that was presented in rogue nation not to mention that it was also written,0.16553374
directed by the same guy and I believe that Mission Impossible fob being a direct,0.09981257
sequel to rogue nation is both a good thing and a troubling thing as well,0.4616373
and I'll get into that later on one thing that this franchise continues to excel,0.19343264
at is creating gripping intense and thrilling action sequences and that is no exception here,0.0737126
in fallout as once again the action is the best thing about this film and,0.08702347
it just continues to build upon itself from one action scene to the next and,0.07249614
something that I don't think I praise enough about the mission impossible franchise is it's,0.059707407
variety in its action sequences from fist fights to gun fights to knife fights to,0.14967054
freaking car chases there's a helicopter chase in this film and even a rope battle,0.5154597
yeah there's actually a fight where our characters are fighting with each other with ROS,0.08051925
I mean I gotta give them props for being so creative and varied with their,0.07155623
action sequences they can always just do action scenes where characters are punching each other,0.24170794
or they're just chasing each other down but sometimes they intermingle sometimes as a fist,0.29301414
fight mixed in with a car chase scene or a car tasting mixed in with,0.15533602
some gun fighting or just multiple things happening in the action sequences that keep it,0.12088663
refreshing and interesting one thing that truly complements the action sequences in this film is,0.07580689
the creative use of the camera the camera moves so phonetically that it complements these,0.15503655
action sequences I don't think there's a single shot of the spill or the camera,0.10176915
is not staged still and it's not that shakey cam nlgger either it's very clean,0.20133947
and precise camera movements that you can see the action unfolding right in front of,0.052526563
you this is how you feel action people can you just take a class with,0.13756698
Christopher McQuarrie and his cinematographer so you understand how to shoot action this is how,0.30620575
you shoot action I think it should go does saying that I thoroughly enjoyed most,0.5876557
of the performances in this film again some were better than others and others were,0.044695232
completely wasted but for what they had to do most of them did a excellent,0.16513257
job particularly Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson who were the strongest performances in this film,0.13451153
I mean Tom Cruise really delivers both in the action sequences and in some of,0.043909185
these emotional scenes where he's talking to characters you really buy the emotion and I,0.13816659
really feel like Tom Cruise whenever he does a Mission Impossible film he puts his,0.101264894
best foot forward because this is his franchise this is his baby and he wants,0.31089434
to make sure that we he makes a great product and that requires him giving,0.054850895
a excellent performance and he does deliver once again and I must I must admire,0.07016091
his dedication to his craft both in his performance and pulling off his stunts and,0.1570827
age 50 something the fact that he's still doing many of these stunts is freakin,0.6847382
impressive and there are some stunts in this film that I wonder whether or not,0.058270495
they did this in real life or did they do it in a studio in,0.10155307
a green-screen because I couldn't tell look the real look so natural it looked like,0.05699165
it was naturally lidded and it made me study okay is that a green screen,0.1044193
or does that actually being shot outside and could not put my finger on it,0.38978866
and I've gotta give props to the special effects Department the lighting departments and the,0.05772572
cinematography for tricking me into believing that it was real if it wasn't I also,0.09048148
really liked the performance of the main villain from the previous film and again they,0.088033795
kept his character intact he's still as methodical and strategic as he was in ground,0.069975555
nation it was to delight to see them again as I still think is the,0.10241896
best villain in the mission impossible franchise and seeing him in this film it clearly,0.14299555
shows I truly adore how they handled Ethan and Ilsa's relationship in this film because,0.06330455
it easily could have came off as hokey or fors or way too over-the-top to,0.10546457
the point where you're like that's not even what their relationship was like in the,0.13982661
previous film but no they understood these two characters to their core and understood the,0.07058634
dynamic of their relationship and they executed it near flawlessly I think the beauty about,0.33264822
their relationship especially in this film is that you can really sense the conflicting emotions,0.1407362
both of them dealt with between picking their mission or choosing to protect the other,0.069347925
their chemistry is just so on point and I've been rooting for this relationship since,0.055269603
Rome nation because so first I remember I felt like Ethan had an equal Elsa,0.0933607
is his equal she's not some damsel that needs to be saved she's not just,0.12840107
some stoic badass she's a character with complex emotions a deep rich backstory and has,0.31455323
their own motivations and can protect herself but unfortunately guys I do have a couple,0.13173358
issues in regards to Mission Impossible fall out my biggest problem comes with its story,0.09364866
while the story was engaging I can't help but notice after thinking about it that,0.057601817
it does kind of feel like a retooled version of rogue nation story as it,0.37526363
follows a lot of the same beats I mean really sit back and reflect upon,0.060294226
the stories of the previous instalments in comparison to fallout yeah Ethan Hunt and his,0.05549909
team who have to find locate and stop an evil terrorist organization that is bent,0.48672754
on destroying the old world order in order to bring in a new world order,0.3313003
which is very similar to the plans of the syndicates who were the main antagonists,0.08245584
of the previous film not to mention that the head of the syndicate is also,0.12240248
a vocal part of the story here in fallout and is also one of the,0.027710093
main buildings not to mention that once and the CIA is on IMSS a war,0.30085516
watch you guys in deadly they did the same thing in rogue nation the CIA,0.4020796
was investigating hi I'm Evan saying oh my god what are you guys doing we're,0.059993472
watching you guys and how many times can we disavow Ethan Hunt I mean they,0.15668797
don't bring it up later on in the film like how many times will this,0.059106592
guy be disavowed you know until he finally breaks and I thought that was gonna,0.31089434
be an interesting focal point but the thing is you've established this character for the,0.06404813
past 22 years there's no way you're going to trick the audience into believing that,0.07058047
he's all of a sudden become evil now so it just felt like fluff to,0.32964677
pad out the story to make it run a bit longer I mean I guess,0.09559641
it's kind of a case of it ain't broke don't fix it as it is,0.07519195
working form the mission impossible franchise but I think after a while and it's been,0.061258018
more than 20 years people are gonna grow sick and tired of this same concept,0.16065006
and they're gonna want something new and refreshing so I want you to keep that,0.08226291
in the back of your mind people handling the mission impossible franchise you might want,0.18214396
to mix it up in the next installment another main issue that I had with,0.06049558
the film deals with the other antagonists played by Henry Cavill who did I spoil,0.05875753
and a few guys oh my god I'm so sorry I mean it's not like,0.13154873
it was so obvious from the get-go that he was gonna be the felon oh,0.23954487
I I can't believe I ruined that for you guys I'm so sorry please as,0.23188162
if none of us knew that he was gonna play the secret Finland in Mission,0.110207796
Impossible follow me from the moustache so the fact that he's even in the damn,0.79297733
film you could probably surmise what kind of character he's gonna play he's either gonna,0.0962102
play a character replacing jeremy renner who's not in the film which i seriously doubted,0.098686315
or be he's gonna be the surprise villain the one pulling the strings all along,0.17216738
and if you chose B you're correct not to mention that the trailers also give,0.096389435
away the fact that he's probably going to play an antagonist considering there are shots,0.12787601
in the trailer where he's going toe-to-toe against Ethan Hunt so you like put two,0.20896022
two two together okay he's probably gonna be like this big reveal supervillain oh I,0.15507351
will say they actually do a really good job at playing of the twist with,0.064684264
another twist kind of like a reverse twist in the sense so I like that,0.14134628
so I guess they were kind of like yeah we know you know he's gonna,0.0864535
be the villain win so it's pretty obvious we made it pretty clear he's gonna,0.25005743
be the villain so they didn't twist on that whole concept and I'm like okay,0.10609285
no huge sports film but the fact of the matter stands is that as a,0.07169475
villain he's just not that interesting or that intimidating yeah he's Henry Cavill he's Superman,0.31089434
he's big strong and tough but he just comes off as a must fist totally,0.5533662
villain which is kind of suitable considering that he does have a mustache it would,0.31089434
have been funny if they just owned it and had him twirling his mustache they're,0.44075683
like saying the boy is going perfectly that I would have accepted that although probably,0.07596655
wouldn't fit the realistic tone that the film was trying to go for so I,0.070928134
understand but I just didn't care about him as a character I didn't find him,0.090324625
all that intimidating I mean ya can handle himself in an action scene to a,0.07860579
certain degree but other than that like there's nothing really remarkable about it he just,0.085114665
he fades into the background and lastly I personally felt that Angela Bassett and Alec,0.053890664
Baldwin were completely wasted in this film I wish they were given more to do,0.19443533
I wish they had more weight to them especially with Angela Bassett because it seemed,0.11329888
like they were gonna do something interesting with her but then she ends up being,0.15180647
like that one CIA agent that's always on the inss and when she reminds me,0.0824008
of that one guy from the first film that is technically still a good guy,0.04545162
but he's always antagonizing Ethan Hunt he's like I want you Ethan okay I'm coming,0.30595127
for you you've done bad naughty naughty and I'm like can't we give Angela Bassett,0.4456888
a more meaty role can she can she actually contribute something interesting to the plot,0.18464322
I still really enjoyed watching Mission Impossible fall out is a great continue - rogue,0.23542413
nation and while it's not as good as rogue nation I will say that it's,0.37518695
definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the mission impossible franchise of your battle,0.105493024
rogue nation check this one out but as always guys I'm not the end-all be-all,0.27223313
opinion when it comes to Mission Impossible fallout I would love to know what you,0.12487781
guys thought of the film as well did you find an exhilarating fun and exciting,0.08445186
to watch like my boring dull repetitive I just can't get into any more and,0.18698743
I wish that they would kill the mission impossible franchise already and do we know,0.5178527
what is one of your favorite franchises that have been going on for more than,0.065272324
