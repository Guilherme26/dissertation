by george sanders and judith anderson okay on to a quick synopsis of the film it says a woman struggles with adjusting to her new role as an aristocrat's wife and living up to the expectations of his first wife oh this sounds like this is going to be fun i'm very excited to watch this so at this point we are going to get into some historical background for those of you who want to jump right onto the film reaction go for it but for those of you who want to stay we're going to get right into it rebecca was originally a novel written by daphne du maurier in 1938. de mourier was inspired by some of the events in charlotte bronte's jane eyre when writing her novel rebecca after rebecca was published it was an instant hit in both england and in the u.s there was a lot of excitement about making this novel into a picture k brown and east coast story editor had recommended this novel to big time movie producer david o selznick and it was also k brown who had recommended gone with the win to him as well so her recommendations were pretty spot-on so selznick was impressed with the novel and decided to buy the film rights for fifty thousand dollars which in today's money would be worth just shy of one million dollars selznick also hired on alfred hitchcock to direct the film after noticing his success streak in england during the production of this film there were some creative differences between selznick and hitchcock selznick really wanted to stick as closely to the book as possible and hitchcock wanted to lighten some of the dark gothic themes of the story now selznick would eventually go on to write hitchcock about his disdain of some of the substitutions that hitchcock added saying quote we bought rebecca and we intend to make rebecca end quote now despite these differences rebecca was received very well with the audiences and it actually went on to be nominated for 11 oscars at the 13th annual academy awards and it won two including best picture okay on to some interesting facts now before this movie's release selznick allowed orson welles to release a radio version of rebecca and unsurprisingly it was a huge hit because as we know everything that orson welles touches turns to gold so this was meant to draw up a lot of publicity for the film version and once the radio version was released to the public everyone was super excited to watch the film version of rebecca filming for rebecca started on september 8th 1939 which was just less than a week after the uk entered world war ii now this became slightly problematic because a lot of the members of the cast were british so 80 years later in october of 2020 netflix released a remake of rebecca starring lily james and armie hammer and then finally this is the first criterion collection film that we are watching where i actually bought the physical copy of the film i was so impressed with just the amount of care that they put into making just the packaging of this and if you compare it to like say you know the good the bad and the ugly this feels really plastic like it's just a case to hold a dvd but this one is like really well packaged by the way this video was not sponsored i literally just wanted to share that with you because i was just blown away by the packaging um now with all that being said i am very excited to get into this film but before we do y'all already know the deal if you haven't already please subscribe to the channel and hit that bell notification to stay in the loop all right everyone it is time to grab your snacks grab your drinks and let's get in to rebecca [Music] also lawrence olivier this is our second film with laurence olivier oh yes mandalay secretive and silent time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls the descriptory dialogue in this beginning is fantastic no don't jump no stop get on with your walking don't hang about here screaming he was literally just about to jump dude she literally just saved your life bro how are you doing how dashing what do you think of monte carlo oh my god you can just tell on his face that he is already intrigued with her and i'm here for it oh no this is not good but you were just a teeny weeny bit forward with mr winter your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me and i'm sure it did him her forwardness she didn't even say anything to him she looked like she was so scared to talk to this de winters guy i was able to have lunch with me okay i'm here for her i wasn't being polite i should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the bars so clumsily come along oh he is so dashing oh my god and it's it's made better by lawrence olivier's performance is mrs van hopper a friend of yours no she's my employer i'm what is known as a paid companion i looked at the word companion in the dictionary once it said a friend of the bosom i can tell that her character is very like like naive like not having a whole lot of like world experience oh you're going sketching this afternoon yes where i haven't made up my mind i'll drive you somewhere in the car oh no please i didn't mean it's like no please it's totally fine you don't have to take care of me you gorgeous man do you know cornwall at all yes i went there once with my father on holiday i saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it right by the sea and the old lady said next man didn't i like the dialogue of this film so far because it doesn't feel like like doctored in any way i don't know if that makes sense but it feels like a very natural very natural conversation between two people i'm really liking the dialogue so far it's just a place where i was born i've lived in all my life now i don't suppose i could ever see it again as soon as he started talking about his home manderly his whole entire demeanor changed he went from like pleasantly dashing to suddenly there's like secrets before she married she was the beautiful rebecca hildreth you know she was drowned here when she was sailing near mandalay he never talks about it of course but he's a broken man oh so rebecca is not this woman rebecca is de winter's wife that had passed at manderley okay okay non-tennis no not particularly that's good we'll go for a drive why is he so perfect for this role oh my god and mind you the only other time that i've seen laurence olivier was in the prince in this show girl now to see him talking in his native accent being dashing as ever i just i think i just found my new celebrity crush as soon as i get over this nasty old cold i promise to keep you from being bored here in monty because i know that's just what you must be bored bored bored oh he's definitely not bored he's definitely being occupied sorry oh this romance is kind of sweet i wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory like perfect that is a great idea those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping altitude she's all like i want to remember this moment forever and he's like well you don't want to remember everything forever because there could be skeletons lurking in your you know closets like what a mood killer would you please tell me mr winter why you asked me to come out with you because i wanted to accompany you oh my god is he falling in love with her what is going on i came to monte carlo with this woman who i am employed with and i found this extremely gorgeous very rich man like life just worked out what do you think my daughter's engaged to be married oh really how nice we must leave for new york at once get reservations she was like i don't want to leave i just met the man of my dreams has mr dewinda come in yet would you connect me please where's that packed well come on my car's waiting at the door oh my god he's calling her oh my god and she misses the call no would you ring mr dewinter please yes madam he's in the shower oh my god it just wasn't meant to be honey it just wasn't meant to be go to new york and you know find another gorgeous aristocrat charming man who makes you feel like a queen i feel so bad for her we're going away which would you prefer new york or mandalay you mean you want a secretary or something i'm asking you to marry me what they only know each they've only known each other for a couple days oh my god what is she gonna decide obviously she's gonna decide to marry him because i mean look at him i don't belong in your sort of world for one thing of course if you don't love me that's a different thing fine blow to my conceit that's all oh i do no you're i love you no it's not love no no no no no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you can't fall in love with someone in three days that's not love that's infatuation and that is not a basis to get married on who's going to break the news to mrs van hopper so you or shall i oh you tell it she'll be so angry what's the number of our room oh my god downstairs i would be bad at this i'm like the person that's like don't marry him girl because you're just infatuated with him but i am the same woman that would literally be falling in love with him like i'm not even gonna lie to you guys also look the way he looks at her y'all i can't i don't know and she's excited because she's been like calling him weirdly for some reason i would fall so fast in love with this man i asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement she's going to be madness who is the lucky lady i apologize for depriving you of your companion can i just can i just comment on that that pan into her face when she realizes that the winter is engaged to her employee oh a beautiful way to depict that moment wow tennis lessons my foot i suppose i have to hand it to you for a fast workout how did you manage it i love the use of the pannins in this film i wonder if that is like a trademark of hitchcock that was then used later on to show suspense i don't know you better leave mrs van harper you'll miss your train mrs dewinter goodbye maddie and i'm telling you as much as we all want to fall in love with maxim de winter okay he's gorgeous dashing the way he looks at her just makes your heart melt but there's something else to him and i just i don't completely trust him [Music] and why did he want to get married to her so quickly you know just questions you gotta start asking yourself the the questions of like you've only known each other for a couple of days why do you want to get married to her so quickly um something's not completely right there's nobody that's mandating oh wow it actually is really beautiful gorgeous it looks kind of like a cottage ish cottage manor manor i don't know my house jargon okay i have everything in readiness for you that's very good of you oh i didn't express this danvers she gave her the up and down look she was like oh no this is like making my nerves bad mrs danvers i i do hope we beat friends i hope i should do everything to your satisfaction madam i've managed the house since mrs dewinter's death and mr winter has never complained her eyes say so much like she says things you can tell she is a woman who's very dedicated to her work but her eyes tell a very different story she is like looking at this new bride all up and down like you think you belong here but you don't belong here like you just see it in her eyes that room in the west wing i was telling you about is there through that door the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea it was mr winters i knew it i knew it was mrs dewinter's room there'd be no other reason to board it up oh and there's like a dog that just sits right in front of it oh i wonder if they decided to use a black dog or like a darkly coated dog be to kind of signify like an omen of some sort i don't know could be me i love the the music in this i think the music really does set the tone between scenes also because it's like the music starts to change a little bit like it was like light-hearted and fun and now it's still light-hearted but there's like little notes of of something a little bit darker in the music she's like still totally in love with him have a look at the times there's a thrilling article on what's the matter with english cricket oh my god laura it's olivier i could not act with this man i would actually in real life fall in love with him my sister beatrice and her husband giles lacey have invited themselves over for lunch today already he's literally leaving her to deal with his sister and her hus and her and her husband his sister and his sister's husband that's weird to say [Music] there's that dog again [Music] yeah that i wonder if that dog is always like that dog is always there whenever it's a room that the that rebecca would frequent so yeah i wonder if this is like her study or something i don't know oh i'm afraid you've made a mistake mrs dewind has been dead for over a year oh i mean she's like i'm she's like when it's like mrs winter she's so out of her depth it's almost like she's expected to live up to this sort of idea this role that i don't think that she's ready for at all she had some pretty high profile friends [Music] oh no i like that phone call that she received and she's like oh i'm sorry mrs dewitt has been dead for over a year and then she hangs it up and she's like wait but i'm mrs dewinter shall we sit down you see she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly why why should she she simply adored rebecca so that's why she's all dark inside cause she's like your tail like i said she's like you're taking a place that is not yours like oh no that could spell trouble my dear you fond of dancing well i love it but i'm not very good at it so but i'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do she sketches a little he doesn't even know what his wife does because they only know each other for like two days he doesn't even know her what don't sail do you no i don't thank goodness for that [Music] oh so he wasn't supposed to mention sailing oh no what does that mean why don't you do something about your hair no it looks perfect i can see by the way you dress you don't care who how you look wow he must have changed a lot then wow the sister is really forward i'm here for it you know the whole story no she doesn't i don't even think i know the whole story now we can have a walk about the place runner get a coat from the flower room for mr winter will you just hearing her being called mrs dewinter doesn't even sound like right because i feel like this whole film we have been conditioned to think of rebecca as mrs dewinter and like this woman as his new wife you know where does that lead to oh it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat oh let's go down there all right we'll walk down and take a look if you really want to oh my god i love this i love the romance of it but i just feel like it's too good to be true he's heard himself no he's all right leave me alone don't you think i better go and see don't bother about him i'll tell you he can't come to anyone he'll find his own way back something happened there there's no way there's no way he's reacting like that because there's something happened there oh and it opened by itself don't go in there i know that dog he comes for the elf ew he's mr de winter's dog you're mrs dewinter oh that's weird i didn't like the way he looked at her rebecca dewinda oh my goodness she had some affiliation with that cottage know i didn't want you to go there but you deliberately went oh because i hate the place and if you had my memories you wouldn't go there or talk about it read and think about it you should never have come back to mandarin he knows there's something that happened that something that he is not telling her secrets skeletons in the closet are those all rebecca's things down there yes she was washed overboard wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone she wasn't afraid of anything everyone knows something that this woman whose name has still not been mentioned okay this woman and the audience don't know they know something because they're all super secretive and super shady i don't know i don't know what's going on they're all comparing me with him yep with rebecca you have qualities that are justified really big shoes so throughout this film there you really do get the sense that she is being compared to this glorious rebecca de winter but then also there are people who are like yeah you're really sweet like they're like comparing her but then also reassuring her that she's like good or in a good position and it just feels really strange i don't know why tell me what was rebecca really like i suppose she was the most beautiful creature i ever saw oh well that makes you feel good huh literally just negated everything he said to her to reassure her oh she's trying you think there's something's right for you doesn't seem your type at all she loves him so desperate like i don't think that he loves her the way that she loves him and the tragedy is that like he's trying to fill these shoes of this woman who i'm not even really sure existed at this point okay because we still have not seen her and it's just sad it's like don't compare yourself to someone who you'll never be you know it appears that mrs danvers has accused robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room what was the thing anyway china cupid sir oh yeah that's one of our treasures isn't it it was it was the thing that she broke that is all i broke the china cupid you broke it is it possible to repair the ornament madam smashed into pieces she looks man look at fruit fritz was even scared for a second he was looking like oh no what's going to go down she kept her composure but her eyes were like this he says dan must must be furious with me oh hang this down oh she should you be frightened of it cause she's scary abstract is made or something i do love how she how danvers really keeps her composure the whole time because you don't know what she's thinking i mean you can see it in her eyes right but like she's so calm about it and it just it intensifies things i suppose that's why you married me never be any gossip about me got it whoa whoa the lighting's on his face i also like how he really kept the audience in the dark here like in this film we're really as much in the dark as you know this woman who is this new mrs dewinters i've gone up to london on some business of the estate i shall return before evening and certainly this brief holiday from me should be welcome maxim she's like in despair she's like where's my maxim i'm sure she does not like that house or the people living in it looking for me left his little bride all alone this is mr favel madam i am rebecca's favorite cousin who one of rebecca's family members oh my god i don't know what i love this this suspense i don't know what to think right now i'm so lost don't go in there girl don't do it i know you want to it's on your face oh she's about to go in and of course the room is big she looks so small in this big space and it's like symbolic of her like not being able to fill these shoes of mrs dewinter that's really i see what you did there hitchcock i see what you did there it's a picture of maxim kind of tells us that she really loved him i love how we get the characterization of rebecca she really is a main character in this film yet she's never physically seen so that's really cool that we kind of get that in this this is where i keep all her clothes feels like this is weird they were made especially for her by the nuns and the convent of sinclair oh wow how glorious that her her uh like her drawers like open like kind of like a lazy susan almost where it like opens up and it's just like it's just so glorious wow i always used to wait up for her no matter how late sometimes she and mr winter didn't come home until dawn very much admired her just hearing of the greatness of rebecca how everyone loved her all these things it's furthering this poor woman's idea of herself like i'm never going to be this i could never be this for max for manderley like i'm not this woman like it's this is a lot poor girl did you ever see anything so delicate it is delicate wow like she looks visibly uncomfortable about this entire situation like it's kind of making me uncomfortable a little bit i'm like i feel that secondhand like discomfort do you think the dead come back and watch the living i don't believe it i wonder if she doesn't come back here demandedly watch you and mr winter together you know that's probably not something that she wants to hear it's probably not something she wants to hear she's constantly surrounded by ideas and thoughts of rebecca it's like haunting her i am sister winter now mrs danvers gotta watch out for her thanks maximum could we have a costume ball i feel that we ought to do something to to make people feel that mendel is just the same as it always was instead of cowering and like running away and being afraid she stood her ground and she's like no i am the new mrs de winter and she like stood her ground okay honey i see you boo you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you oh you mean those at the top of the stairs i'll go and look at them she is staging a war oh my goodness i've heard mr winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings oh well well well that's a splendid idea mrs danvers i'm i'm very grateful um i don't trust her i don't trust her at all um i wonder if that's rebecca and that costume is going to get a rise out of the winter oh my god i think that's what's going to happen you were the first one down yes where's the child well she's keeping a costume for every single show oh lovely oh please don't come in beatrice i don't want anyone to see my costume every single aspect of this film has some sort of like suspenseful leading on the audience what's gonna happen next how's everyone gonna react like he truly is the master of suspense i just i'm scared i know something is off good evening mr de winter oh my god what did i say what did i say dan vs staging a war oh i watched you go down just as i watched her a year ago even in the same dress you couldn't compare you knew it you never trust your enemy dude mmm that naivety got her this time am i done do you think you should never hate me so you're trying to take her i knew it i've seen his face he doesn't love you he wants to be alone again with her you have nothing to live for really have you she is just tearing her down emotionally and mentally oh this scene is so powerful and we feel with this woman everything you are strong you can do this fight here i'm talking as if she could listen she can't hear me she's like you could never compare to her like what are you even doing like just tearing her down that was that was and but here's the thing she did it keeping her composure very sinister stuff i knew where rebecca's body was because i put it there what wait a second did he just confess to murder did he did he murder rebecca wait a second wait a second wait a second what is going on oh my god how could we be close when i knew you were always thinking of rebecca you thought i loved rebecca i hated it oh my god that changes everything this whole time i'm thinking to myself he just loved her so much and he's grieving her death but no he just literally said he hated her i want to hear his story okay i was told i was the luckiest man in the world but i never had a moment's happiness with her she was incapable of love she stood there laughing and told me all about herself oh my god so what did rebecca do i want like an origin story of rebecca now i i need to know more about her so i'll play the part of a devoted wife mistress of your precious mandalay i'll make it the most famous show place in england if you like i kept the bargain and so did she apparently oh she played the game brilliantly so it's like we're really getting a full character analysis or a full character development of someone who we don't actually ever see i think that is fantastic then there was a cousin of hers a man named favel yes i know him why didn't you tell me i thought it would remind you of rebecca so i wonder if he really did marry this woman because he really actually found love with her literally this plot twist just changed the entire perspective of the film oh my god when i found that she'd come back quietly from london i thought that favela was with her and i knew then that i couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer okay so favel is not rebecca's cousin i think favelas might be her lover at least that's what it sounds like that is so twisted a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her suddenly she got up started to walk toward me oh my god and they're using the camera angles to literally show us her movements they're lit they're literally characterizing a person who doesn't actually exist in terms of like like physically like she isn't physically there and yet they're making her be there that is so strange i must have stuck almost triumphant she stumbled and fell it's almost like she wanted him to kill her like to say i got you even in death oh my gosh i remember wondering why she was still smiling and i realized she was dead but you didn't kill me she fell it was an accident who would believe me yeah yeah and and who would believe him because she's she's literally shown herself as like the devoted perfect wife nobody knows about her like secret life except for him so no one would believe him they're writing if they find out it was rebecca you must simply say that you made a mistake about the other body she can't harm you anymore we're the only two that's not true no maxim you and i she literally has not been shown this entire film and still somehow she is still the strongest character in this film there's nothing you can do she won i loved you my darling he really did love her no no she hasn't won no matter what happens now she hasn't won bro she totally won like i'm just so blown away at the fact that she literally has not even been physically shown yet she holds more pow the freaking movie is named after her okay this is this is rebecca's movie she is the shining star of the film and we don't even see her i am floored i don't mind this whole thing except for you he loves her oh we still have this strong romance that we can still root for you know that we're like okay he truly loves her he truly wants to be with her which i like i don't know nothing i don't want to go to the asylum clearly he didn't see anything okay move on anyway i feel bad that i misjudged him in the beginning he was a little creepy i'm not gonna lie but you know what he truly was just kind of like a a bystander mr winter please i have to ask you a very personal question where relations between you and the late mr winter perfectly happy she looks like she's literally about to blow and say something and screw everything up she just needs to chill out i won't stand this any longer and you might as well know now will adjourn to oh lunch mr winter i presume you'll be available for us then oh my god this is so intense darling wait here a few moments i'll see if i can find old frank and how does the bride find herself today you know you've grown up a bit since i lost this oil what do you want for them you can also kind of see that in the the wardrobe or the costuming choices that they've used throughout the film she looks like she really has grown up like this really has taken the innocence right out of her i find myself in a rather awkward position it's from rebecca and what's more she had the foresight to put the date on it but i can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night i'm not gonna lie i kind of like favel's character like he's like he's sly but he does it very like charismatically he's like i know what's going on you know like i don't know i really like his character even though i feel like he's a bad guy he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if i made it worth his while just seen the doctor and i'm going down to mandalay right away i have something terribly important to tell you rebecca i thought the letter was going to be something like like more in-depth like you know starting a new life hey maybe this kid might be yours i still don't know if that's her cousin ah here she is the missing link apply the motives i believe you'll know everyone else and we know that she is like in total admiration of rebecca so she's oh something's gonna go down i feel it who was rebecca's doctor i don't know anything about it oh don't give me that danny you knew everything about rebecca you knew she was in love with me didn't you love was a game to her only a game it made her laugh i tell you i knew that i knew that she admired that dark side of rebecca i knew it it has been suggested mrs dewinter was deliberately murdered the name of the murderer it's a lovely name george fortescue maximilian de winter look at her face the first time she's shown emotion on her face we don't want reminiscences danny what was his name dr baker 165 goldhawk road shepherd's bush there you are colonel there's where you'll find your motive he is just a little freaking rat that is the first time i'd ever seen emotion on her face i've never attended a mrs winter in my life the lady must have used an assumed name the woman was very seriously ill what was wrong with her cancer that would have given her motive to want to take her life literally this plan the favela had literally backfired on him that's what you get for being a douchebag there was nothing that could be done for her except wait she smiled in a queer sort of way when i told her it was a matter of months she said oh no doctor not that long she knew she was gonna die and she had pla like she planned this she planned this cunning woman please just let them live in peace danvers please they've been through so much oh my god she's gonna set up she's gonna set a fire she's gonna set a fire i can i can see it she has the candle she has the crazy eyes oh my god she's gonna commit arson just dry it it's that's not the northern lights that's mandalay she's totally dead there's no way that she's like that oh she made it out oh jesus thank you thank you thank you that she made it out i was literally freaking out she she's in there she looks crazy that final scene with vr oh what a film that was fantastic that had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end like all of the twists and at the end it just kept coming just new information just pow pow pow right at us i mean that was fantastic i think that was so good you never saw rebecca and yet she was such a prevalent figure in this film so the fact that they were able to make this character so real and so like visceral without actually having her physically there is astounding it was fantastic and then the plot twists where like we got to see a different side of rebecca not this brilliant beautiful cunning woman but this like sadistic sinister monster even though mr dewinter maxim didn't tell us what she had said to him after those four days of marriage we still got the sense that it was something that was a lot darker than you know what she was letting on on the surface i definitely have to give that one a 10. like that was so good it and i'm that just got me so amped for the rest of this month to see you know all of these different hitchcock films i cannot wait oh my goodness thank you guys so much for watching
