"Whoo, you got another hit on your hands? So me, you got another hit on your hands"
"I would like to say to all the fans, which I'm going to play a game"
"boss, Ah, of Spider-man Which frond again, that I think the overwhelming majority of you are going to love this movie"
There was plenty of fanservice in this movie
There is Fourth Wall breaking
There are cameos made
There are plenty of Easter eggs and callbacks
It was a great movie
I had a very good time as a Spider-man fan
It was heartwarming
It was
"there was plenty of action, plenty of jokes and planning a web slinging, and that, it's sad moments to definitely uh, tugged at the heartstrings a little bit there"
"So if you don't know, there's a movie called Spider-man into the Spider Verse and it's all about no"
"No, No, it's all about Miles Morales and him running into Peter Parker and several other Spider people from the Spider Verse and they have to foil the Kingpins plans With some things that have caused the problem and predicament that they're actually in there"
You have our movie
"and first of all, I'd like to say that I did love the animation"
The animation reminded me of claymation
You guys understand or know what claymation is? It's from my date
"I remember in the days of 80s, and watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer stuff like that"
"I don't know if they were all clay, but I know they were stop-motion but it's the name given to kind of like you know, the stop-motion clay figures and stuff like that in the children's films When I was little I remember it hearing that name and it reminded me of that in that it was"
It was fluid but choppy at the same time
"If you've seen the trailers, you already understand what the animation looks like"
You know what I mean
There's something's almost like
"there's a frame missing like it's like if the animation frame was like, If the frames animation like five, there's like one missing all the time or something"
I don't know
one than one
one even miss event one didn't miss and I don't know
"I understand how they got it to look like that, but I liked it"
I saw it in 3d and I must say I didn't need to see it in 3d because I couldn't tell that much
No sort of 3d movies you go see in 3d
"You're like Wow, I can"
really
"Yeah, I don't need to see"
this is 3d
but the kind of collector I am and I do blot by this little blue ray
I will get it in 3d
"I gotta say that movie was a little slow in the beginning, but it definitely picked up and I enjoyed the story of Miles Morales"
I am old-school Spider-man fan
"I know of Miles, but I don't know Miles, and I really never cared for the character of Miles Morales Until now, I did like the way the movie portrayed him, his relationship with his father, his mother, his uncle, and I liked the way they brought the other Spider people, including Peter Parker into his universe, And was, it was interesting how that was done, and I was thrown off by something that happens in the beginning"
"Because I was saying, Wait a minute"
"I'll say Oh yeah, wait a minute"
That was a different color
So you guys all know what I'm talking about
when you do see the film
"I like the dynamic between him and Peter Miles, learning to be Spider-man I like to dynamic between all all of the spider people, whether it was Spider-gwen or you know, Peter Porker or Spider Noir or it, there were several spider people in there, So I'm telling you the movie was good"
The pink
"The King Pig, Pink in the Kingpin was rather badass and bigger than I thought he was gonna be"
Like some reason
I didn't realize he was in the movie
"I don't know why, but I think he was shown in the trailers, but I just never guy"
"No, he was big, but they'd really go for super-sized him"
"In this several other villains, You will find out art in this movie and will make an appearance and I don't know what else to say, Man, it was badass"
It was badass
"I had a good time, other than it being a little slow in beginning, I had time"
"Love the animation, Love, the voice-acting voice acting was great"
The story was good
"I liked it a lot, and I was surprised several times in the movie"
I was saying twice twice
"At the most, I'm thinking twice"
"two, maybe three"
I think it was twice
"No, three times"
there are three moments that kind of shocked me
"I was like Wow, No, but you guys are going to absolutely enjoy this"
"I'm going to give Spider-man into the Spider-verse I, 4"
5 out of 5
