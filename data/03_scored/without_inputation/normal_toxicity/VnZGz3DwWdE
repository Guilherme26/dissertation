Breakfast at Tiffany's has a crystal clear nice wrap it up in a bow ending,0.12832071
whereas other films like la-la-land the ending is real and hits you so I really,0.3280937
like the ending of eighth grade I think it's a really good movie I think,0.15120466
it's important to see um I think like a lot of people who like the,0.10251159
romantic comedies in life or like the blockbusters will not like it's not a mainstream,0.13527033
film not a lot of dialogue not la characters it's very much in the mind,0.09705772
of her so if you like realistic films are are okay being inside the mind,0.29190114
of thirteen-year-old girl then definitely it's great but yeah so overall I think 8th grades,0.24192402
are good film I can definitely see it getting a word but I don't see,0.05391671
it winning though because I think a lot of things will beat it it's gonna,0.18561086
be a heavy season between stars Boren and all the other good stuff so definitely,0.07610382
but it creates a good film I highly recommend it so go ahead and watch,0.08114317
