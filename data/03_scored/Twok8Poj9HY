[Applause] the last Jedi was directed and written by Rian Johnson and it stars Daisy,0.050513577
Ridley Adam driver John boyega Oscar Isaac Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill and many many others,0.09907635
and since the force awakens we have seen the strengths of the resistance diminishing and,0.0418319
the power of the first order increasing and as rey is looking to learn the,0.06688516
ways of the Jedi from master Luke Skywalker the resistance finds itself in a race,0.11278955
against time to run from the grasp of the first order and Supreme Leader Snoke,0.16479929
the last Jedi is a film long anticipated for many and I will say this,0.06490602
this film will make the two generations of fans or maybe three very happy Rian,0.07914961
Johnson has written and directed a very ballsy risk-taking unconventional Star Wars film he directs,0.11283837
the nlgger out of this you can see a lot of the influences he has,0.31363118
named for this movie in the action sequences in the storyline in the character arcs,0.044847514
and he takes a lot of swerves just when you think you know where this,0.18409817
movie is going where certain characters are going to go he swerves you yet again,0.11052517
hitting you with surprises that will leave you gutwrench but he does this not at,0.24185808
the cost of story not at the cost of characters and how they were established,0.05556077
not at the cost of their progress of their evolution of their growth he does,0.06658293
this through having conflict and tension and dramatic way throughout the film from the very,0.082031906
beginning from the very beginning the resistance is between a rock and a hard place,0.086086385
as the first order and Snoke are hunting them down the last few remnants the,0.19256918
remain of the resistance and this tension this dramatic weight this running against time is,0.0919126
felt throughout every single storyline in this film as ray tries to learn from Luke,0.024503045
they do not have a very easy relationship and the movie takes its chances with,0.09044725
how we see and have the perception of the Jedi and the Lord and this,0.03452915
character of Luke Skywalker and just when you think that you understand the character the,0.08141004
movie yet again takes chances and changes your perception and this proves excellent writing from,0.06302181
the part of Ryan Johnson as he explores and expands the lore and our understanding,0.050600067
of it and of certain characters in this film in ways I never even imagined,0.14236483
and a way he shoots this some the way he directs there are a lot,0.4586336
of creative visuals in this film that I never thought possible a lot of his,0.121740535
storytelling is very risky particularly without spoiling with Rey and kylo Ren and now they,0.11561405
mirror each other and how they contrasts and how the force binds them together and,0.11304921
now it drifts them apart let's talk about Luke Skywalker because we did not get,0.12857847
enough of him in the last film this is Mark Hamill's best performances Luke and,0.06954889
his best performance in his career this character is going through a lot the minimal,0.06498448
exposition that was in the force awakens you got of Luke you understand that here,0.067918435
through his character development this character has gone through a lot he is still going,0.081384435
through a lot and most importantly and completely unexpected he is a completely flawed character,0.19720405
and that elevated the film for me a lot the way he teaches Rey and,0.057782456
what he has gone through as you find out in this film are very very,0.10242779
emotionally heavy they are very emotionally investing and they keep you on the edge of,0.20937872
your seat just like the tension that is felt throughout the film not only with,0.092502356
the first-order rent in the resistance but also the friction between ray and Luke and,0.046503533
Luke Skywalker does have some pants piecing moments in this film that are just nerd,0.5213757
heaven I I nearly pissed my pants in the movie theater watching some of the,0.40328178
stuff that Luke Skywalker goes through in this film and of course I will not,0.13276696
spoil anything but a certain cameo in this movie was like looking into the face,0.21755144
of God I'm saying nothing else Daisy really is impeccable as Rey once more a,0.11014864
magnificently written character not a Mary Stuart so I refer the haters out there and,0.1511252
to film me yet again takes its chances not only with her as a character,0.17454983
but the way you find out more about rate again the visual storytelling comes into,0.06318328
this the way Rey explores herself her connection to the force her past and other,0.10388676
characters as pasts are very very risk-taking and bold and they pay off beautifully John,0.073827
boyega s Finn is funny SL once more and the film very well incorporates the,0.1837495
funnies into the sim the comedy is very well incorporated it doesn't feel like it,0.12781139
to Rails the story whatsoever it feels like something organic that comes out of the,0.06495402
characters and Finn is yet again the greatest example of that and his chemistry with,0.061328508
Rose is also spectacular Callie Murray Tran is also great in this film their chemistry,0.052239336
is excellent and both these characters really connect with each other because they are both,0.056030184
going through something very heavy emotionally speaking both Ameren is great once more coolest guy,0.13968645
in the galaxy with another cool jacket to add to this collection and he was,0.07670015
using a very surprising way for me I'm not going to spoil anything of course,0.12241586
if you like what you saw with the grey areas of the resistance in rogue,0.25307626
one you will like what you see from Poe here and let's talk about Carrie,0.09090809
Fisher it was hard watching this film I'm not going to lie there's one scene,0.1816871
in particular that we'll talk about in the spoilers review oh it was hard to,0.06391371
breathe in that moment and Leia as a character is excellent as well she's still,0.12999985
a badass she's still the general and that's one moment that I've always dreamed of,0.30761918
seeing with Leia in this film that just brought the happiest of smiles to my,0.07929414
face and we'll talk about it in the spoilers review but Carrie Fisher thank you,0.05496568
it's also her best performance in any Star Wars film and I'm very happy with,0.08086979
this Adam driver s kylo Ren continues to be yet again a conflicted complex and,0.08272258
layered villain this film deepens our understanding of kylo Ren and it swerves us with,0.16168961
this character a lot I really like the route that they took of this character,0.051268976
it was not at all that I was expecting it was not at all what,0.07230244
I envisioned for this character and in made me afraid sometimes I have to commend,0.07818659
the Ryan Johnson's courage in this film because with characters with the storyline with the,0.047836885
way he executes the storyline in this film it's ballsy this film made me afraid,0.18029685
because I wasn't liking certain directions they were taking and the film swerves me and,0.11497197
again to bring me something new I had never seen before but there's a storyline,0.1308451
with Finn and Rose that I don't have problems with but I do have problems,0.11117763
that it was so long there are incredibly important things happening in their storyline thematically,0.123148255
speaking just like with any other storyline but it does take a little bit too,0.09178183
long to get resolved and to keep going it feels like it stops like it,0.093114704
slows down unlike the rest of the film and speaking of that the film in,0.079785995
general is very slow-paced it takes its time with rays and kylo ren's training it,0.08642871
explores the mental side of it how it affects them psychologically and how they progress,0.24241155
through these struggles and it does so with a lot of other characters the action,0.05025889
sequences are incredible both in space with the Falcon flying around and the lightsaber battles,0.0779651
the lightsaber battles are probably the best in Star Wars history not gonna lie maybe,0.0795198
not better than the final duel between Luke and Vader in return but my god,0.07476296
the white shots the way we see our actors doing their stunts fighting around moving,0.47932678
their sabers the fighting styles and all it's magnificent and the cinematography is also excellent,0.065050565
I gotta congratulate the cinematography this is probably one of the most beautiful looking Star,0.0597156
Wars film there is maybe the best one maybe top to maybe top three not,0.06408608
sure but it is beautiful the last Jedi has a very clear thematic a thematic,0.12953603
I cannot tell you about otherwise it will be spoilers once you see the film,0.10089737
it'll all make sense and it is a film that imposes a lot of questions,0.06474146
it changes questions that we had before into new ones it gives us a lot,0.06746603
of answers and it makes us look forward into the future there's great exploration of,0.042209722
the lore a great swirl in the storyline and our perception of the characters and,0.033026457
the Star Wars universe it's a great addition to the franchise it keeps pushing our,0.026229644
characters and their stories forward it has great dramatic way there are moments of pure,0.052651934
raw emotion in this film moments where you will cry like that before moments where,0.11407566
you will weep like never before in moments where you will just feel pure raw,0.41141692
anger the last Jedi is by far the ballsiest Star Wars movie ever made and,0.3150993
in my money it will go down as the most controversial Star Wars movie ever,0.09087098
made the last Jedi is absolutely the stuff that dreams are made of what did,0.072134785
