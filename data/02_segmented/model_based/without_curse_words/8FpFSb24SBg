"Hey guys, it's Steph"
Welcome to my channel
"I've had a very busy couple of weeks here, so I have kind of gotten off of my regular posting schedule, but I just wanted to get this video up as soon as I could because I was just so excited to watch it and to react to it on my channel"
"Because a lot of people have given me requests for this, especially on my inside out commentary"
Today we are going to be watching Coco
"I know I've been doing a lot of horror and I still have a huge list of movies that have been requested, or just movies that I really want to watch on my channel that I'm going to be getting to, But this one I really wanted to do as soon as I could"
I don't know much about this movie at all
"I believe it is about the Day of the dead and it's about the main characters, kind of like ancestry and culture, and kind of learning about that"
I know this movie has such high praises
So many people have said what an amazing movie this is
anyways
That's really all I have to say about this
"I'm so excited to watch, so let's get into it"
"Oh, I love this intro already"
I can already tell this is going to be such a beautifully designed and animated movie
"The papa, He was a musician"
"He and his family would sing and dance, and one day he left with his guitar and never returned"
They always gotta hit us with a sad story
"In the beginning, she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician"
"Oh, okay, after banishing all music from her life, she found a way to provide for her daughter"
"Oh, you're a twig"
"Nico, have some more"
No gracias
I asked if you would like more thumbnails
I feel like grandmothers in a lot of different cultures
Just love giving the grandchildren as much food as possible
"Oh, that's rough"
music is amazing
"Oh, my gosh"
"is this dog gonna be a main character? Wow, I love that dog"
Nesto de la Cruz took his first steps towards becoming the most beloved singer in Mexico
"Is this going to be his great great grandfather That tore his family apart until 1942, when he was crushed by"
"Come on, what did the La Cruz always say? Seizure moment? Oh, that's like his little mentor"
"Yeah, I don't blame him for being terrified to tell them that he likes music"
"If that's how they react to this, it's just poor Dante"
Follow you forever
Now go get my shoe
I love the humor in this
So far all this work to bring the family together
Look how beautiful that is coming home
No mama
it's okay
"Oh, this is really cool because I don't know a lot about the Day of the Dead and what the traditions are"
So I think that this is really cool that Disney did a movie representing a different culture and different traditions
This music is so beautiful
I'm gonna play Mariachi Plaza
If it kills me nothing
"We've all decided it's time, joined us in the workshop"
I'm sure he'll be thrilled to do that
Carrying on the family's tradition
I also don't trust that dog underneath there
I feel like he's gonna mess something up
"Oh my God, I knew it"
he was so close
I knew it
I'm gonna be a musician
What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family
It's all that
I mean
"Yeah, you guys react very poorly to anything regarding music"
You said my family would guide me
"Well, De la Cruz is my family"
He's got a point
"Oh God, is she gonna break his guitar or something? I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda"
"Wow, that's beautiful"
"Oh God, he's gonna try and steal his guitar"
Your great great grandson
I need to borrow this
Oh no
"I'm gonna play the plaza, just like you did"
That is pretty terrifying
I
"Oh, is this his family? Yeah, see, I love that"
I hope he adopts the dog at the end and he becomes part of the family
I'm pretty sure I saw something like that shot in the trailer and I thought it was so cool looking
Look at all of that
"Oh, your photos are in your son"
Have a great listen
"Yes, what about the worker? They don't get to see their family"
Okay when I say that was pretty bad just now that that was a lie
and I apologize for doing that
No photo
That's really sad
I don't know what I do if no one put up my photo
"I know that sounds so depressing You starve from the dead, but I wasn't stealing the guitar"
"It was my great great grandfather's Yeah, don't say that in front of her"
"You know, she's the reason why the whole family hates music"
"I give you my blessing to go home to put my photo back on the ofrenda, and to never play music again"
"What she can't do that? here we go, Mariachi, plus, here I come two seconds and you already break your promise"
I've just had a really hard dialogue and I could really use an amigo right now
"Oh, I'll be your friend"
"Oh, you like De La Cruz, He and I go way back"
I can get your front
proceeds to his sunrise spectacular show
This is De la Cruz
"No one's ever put up my picture, But you can change that"
this is okay
So he's not De la cruz
"Well, this is great because he needed a friend so now he has one one hiccup"
The La Cruz is a tough guy to get to and I need to cross that bridge soon
"Like Yeah, he definitely doesn't know De La Cruz, right, He's just lying about that"
"Hey, you said you have real tickets"
That that was a lie
I apologize for that
At least he's honest and feels remorse
Or maybe he only feels remorse when he gets caught
"That's probably it, actually, And they go to drink from the milk of their mother, who is a cactus, but also me, and her milk is not him"
This is quite an elaborate piece
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals
He's too busy hosting the fancy party at the top of his tower
I know where we have to go
I don't want to see your stupid face actor
"Come on, my favorite character"
Promise we'll bring it right back like the time you promised to bring back my van or my mini fridge
"Oh, just yeah, he has a bad track record"
You okay? I'm fading it
I can feel it
"Oh, cause no one remembers him"
"Why am I getting emotional? Oh yeah, I'm with the dog on this one when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you"
You disappear from this world
"Oh, that is so heartbreaking"
That was actually a question I had in the beginning where it's like obviously families are honoring those in their family that they love That have passed on
"But eventually if people stop having children in your family, everyone's gonna forget about you"
"at some point if generations don't pass on these stories and these people that's really sad, Is Ernesto de la Cruz going to be really rude or not appreciative of Miguel? I don't know"
I'm just stressed about
He idolizes him so much when he actually meets him
I feel like people are always so disappointed when they meet their idols
"Okay, even the dog is disappointed"
I'm nervous for him
You got this
Let's go
Hector's great
Don't go crazy
He's a natural
I love their friendship
"Oh my gosh, this is one of the most wholesome and pure friendships I think I've seen in a movie in a very long time"
Why do you have to ruin everything? Run away from his family
They just want to send him back to the line of the living room
You said That was your only family
The only person who could send you home
I do have another family
I could have taken my photo back this whole time
"Okay, This friendship crumbled a lot faster than I thought it would keep your dumb photos"
Stay away from me Now
Music's the only thing that makes me happy
It's very selfish of the family to be like you can't like music because one person that was mean to us and screwed us over was a musician
"If my family was like this, Oh my gosh, I would be the same way as Miguel"
I wanted to put down roots
He wanted to play for the world
What's more selfish than leaving your family to go do pursue music
Do pursue to go pursue music is to then ban every single other person in your family from liking listening to playing music
"All right, The moment of truth is coming"
I'm so nervous for him
This is like Jay Gatsby's parties
This is a lot
He really had it
there
"Are you all right, Nino, my boy, with a talent like yours"
"How could I not listen? Okay, he seems nice"
I have a great great grandson
Good
"Okay, I was really nervous"
He was going to be mean or I don't know
I am sorry to see you go home again
I hope you die
"Oh, he's going to try and give him the blessing and it's not going to work"
I give you my blessing
You said you take back my photo
You promised Miguel
"he told me he knew you, Hector, please began"
You're being forgotten
And whose fault is that Hector Please? Those were my songs
You took my songs that made you famous
Being forgotten is because you never told anyone that I wrote them
That's crazy
They let go
"No, we made a great team, but you died and I knew something was gonna go wrong"
He couldn't be perfect
"I would move heaven and earth, but in the movie this is not good"
"Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up, so people are calling him Chorizo, even though that's not the reason he died or something"
"I, Oh, my gosh"
"all right, I, um, I did not see any of this coming, security"
"You took everything away from me, poor Hector"
I would hate to have you think that you murdered Hector for his songs
"You don't think that everyone knows the good guy? Yeah, we know security take care of Miguel"
He'll be extending his stay whatever family success doesn't come for free
"Yeah, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your mom, but you're dead"
"I trusted him, right Hector to the rescue, right Hector and Dante? They told me not to be like, but I didn't listen well"
You didn't know that he was actual trash
"Oh no, I just wanted to see her again"
I never should have left Santa Cecilia
"Hector deserves the best, but he loved her so much like"
Wait a minute
This makes so much sense
It's him
"that's my mama, Coco, that's my mommy"
"Melda, is that you? Oh, this is so much better"
"Is that on me? Oh, my gosh"
what an amazing plot twist
The family wrongly understands what happens because he was trying to come home
"Wow, this is so cute"
"Ew, I don't wanna be crying"
"Oh, all right, get it together, Dante to the rescue"
"God, you look good"
"Oh yeah, maybe too soon to try that out"
"I didn't want to listen, but he was right"
"Nothing is more important than family, But first, I need to find De la Cruz to get ectorso"
"Wow, so he can see Coco again"
Hector should be on our friend
He's part of our fam
Try to go
"It's true, Imelda And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise, And I people make mistakes"
He was coming back
I'm running out of time
It's coco
"True, I I can't forgive you, but I will help you"
That's fair
Okay progress
"good luck, Muchacho gracias"
"Oh, I love this photo"
give it to me again
Send Miguel home
Got your pedals Now we just have to wait
You're related to Hector
The photo
you shouldn't have pointed at it
"You should just quick, grabbed it"
"Oh, I really don't want that floor to be ripped up"
"Be very careful, please"
"Is she gonna tell the truth of what happened actually, and that Hector should be the one that everyone loves, Not de la cruz"
"Oh, or she's just to sing"
She is killing it
Can you guys wait until after she's done? Okay? good to go home to put up our photo and to never never play music again
Do never forget how much your family loves you
"Oh, she came around"
who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment? That's not really what that should mean
"apologies, old friend, but the show must go on"
Really turned around
Oh no orchestra
Listen
"This gives me Paulo, an Isabella vibe"
It's from Blizzy Mcguire movie
We love to see history repeat itself
It's almost sunrise
"No, no, I can't leave you"
I promised I'd put your photo up
I promise I won't let Goku forget you
"No, she's not gonna forget"
I have faith that it's gonna turn around
He wanted you to have this
"Oh, is he gonna play? Remember me not again"
"Oh God, this movie is so emotional"
I kept his letters a photo
My heart is so warm
"Okay, all right, let's see what happens"
"Yes, they're our families and they're counting on us to remember them"
"Oh, that's sad"
but now she's with her family right
Enjoy your visit
"Oh, yay"
"finally, I'm so happy for him"
This is such an amazing ending
"Oh, I'm not gonna cry for a third time, though I'm done"
I'm done
Maybe I don't know
"Wow, I loved that ending"
"Well, I love the whole movie, but that was a beautiful way to end it"
"Okay, all right, there's I'm not crying again"
There's just still some tears that didn't get wiped away
I loved this movie
"This honestly might be one of my, if not my favorite Pixar movie"
"Now, like I said, it was so cool to see other cultures, other traditions, other main characters that we don't normally see in these Pixar movies being represented here"
I think that's an amazing thing that Disney did with this movie and I hope they continue to represent other cultures and traditions and people from all over the world
The visual aspect was breathtaking
It was beautiful and I expected that again
It's a Disney Pixar
"I get it, but I just am blown away by the animation on this movie"
"I loved all the music, especially the last song and the last scene"
Anyways
"guys, that was all I have for you today"
"Thank you so much for watching, and I will see you guys next time for another video"
